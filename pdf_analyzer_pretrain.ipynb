has corresponded to a dif- ferent phase in the way computer networks were used. When the first edition ap- peared in 1980, networks were an academic curiosity. When the second edition appeared in1988,networks were used byuniversitiesandlarge businesses. When thethirdeditionappeared in1996,computer networks, especially the Internet, had become adailyrealityformillionsofpeople. Bythefourthedition,in2003,wire- less networks and mobile computers had become commonplace for accessing the Web and the Internet. Now, in the fifth edition, networks are about content dis- tribution (especially videos using CDNs and peer-to-peer networks) and mobile phonesare small computers ontheInternet. New inthe Fifth Edition Among the many changes in this book, the most important one is the addition ofProf. David J.Wetherall as aco-author. David bringsa rich backgroundinnet- working, having cut his teeth designing metropolitan-area networks more than 20 years ago. He has worked with the Internet and wireless networks ever since and is a professor at the University of Washington, where he has been teaching and doingresearch oncomputer networks andrelated topics forthepastdecade. Ofcourse, thebookalsohasmanychanges tokeep upwiththe: ever-changing worldofcomputer networks. Amongthese are revised andnewmaterial on Wireless networks (802.12and802.16) The 3Gnetworks usedbysmart phones RFID andsensornetworks Content distribution usingCDNs Peer-to-peer networks Real-time media (fromstored, streaming, andlivesources) Internet telephony(voice overIP) Delay-tolerant networks Amoredetailed chapter-by-chapter listfollows. xix xx PREFACE Chapter 1 has the same introductory function as in the fourth edition, but the contents have been revised and brought up to date. The Internet, mobile phone networks, 802.11, and RFID and sensor networks are discussed as examples of computer networks. Material on the original Ethernet—with its vampire taps— hasbeenremoved, alongwiththematerial onATM. Chapter 2, which covers the physical layer, has expanded coverage of digital modulation (including OFDM as widely used in wireless networks) and 3G net- works (based on CDMA). New technologies are discussed, including Fiber to the Homeandpower-line networking. Chapter 3,onpoint-to-point links,hasbeen improved intwoways. The mater- ial oncodes for error detection and correction has been updated,andalso includes a brief description of the modern codes that are important in practice (e.g., convo- lutional and LDPC codes). The examples of protocols now use Packet over SONET and ADSL. Sadly, the material onprotocol verification has been removed asitislittleused. In Chapter 4, on the MAC sublayer, the principles are timeless but the tech- nologies have changed. Sections on the example networks have been redone accordingly, including gigabit Ethernet, 802.11, 802.16, Bluetooth, and RFID. Alsoupdatedisthecoverage ofLAN switching, including VLANs. Chapter 5, on the network layer, covers the same ground as in the fourth edi- tion. The revisions have been to update material and add depth, particularly for quality of service (relevant for real-time media) and internetworking. The sec- tions on BGP, OSPF and CIDR have been expanded, as has the treatment of multicastrouting.Anycast routingisnowincluded. Chapter 6, on the transport layer, has had material added, revised, and re- moved. New material describes delay-tolerant networking and congestion control in general. The revised material updates and expands the coverage of TCP con- gestion control. The material removed described connection-orientednetwork lay- ers, something rarely seen anymore. Chapter 7, onapplications, has also been updated and enlarged', 'While mater- ial on DNS and email is similar to that in the fourth edition, in the past few years there have been many developments in the use of the Web, streaming media and content delivery. Accordingly, sections on the Web and streaming media have been brought up to date. A new section covers content distribution, including CDNsandpeer-to-peer networks. Chapter 8, on security, still covers both symmetric and public-key crypto- graphy for confidentiality and authenticity. Material on the techniques used in practice, including firewalls and VPNs, has been updated, with new material on 802.11security andKerberos V5added. Chapter 9 contains a renewed list of suggested readings and a comprehensive bibliography of over 300 citations to the current literature. More than half of these are to papers and books written in 2000 or later, and the rest are citations to classic papers. PREFACE xxi ListofAcronyms Computer books are full of acronyms. This one is no exception.

HowtoUse the Book To help instructors use this book as a text for courses ranging in length from quarters to semesters, we have structured the chapters into core and optional ma- terial. The sections marked with a ‘‘*’’ in the table of contents are the optional ones. Ifamajor section (e.g., 2.7) issomarked, all ofitssubsections are optional. They provide material on network technologies that is useful but can be omitted from a short course without loss of continuity. Of course, students should be encouraged to read those sections as well, to the extent they have time, as all the material isuptodate andofvalue.

ANDREWS.TANENBAUM DAVIDJ.WETHERALL 1 INTRODUCTION Each of the past three centuries was dominated by a single new technology. The 18th century was the era of the great mechanical systems accompanying the Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the steam engine. During the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwide telephone networks, the invention of radio and television, the birth and unpre- cedented growth of the computer industry, the launching of communication satel- lites,and,ofcourse, theInternet. As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging in the 21st century and the differences between collecting, transporting, storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with hun- dreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be able to examine the current status of even their most remote outpost at the push of a button. Asourabilitytogather, process, and distribute information grows, the de- mandforever moresophisticatedinformation processing growsevenfaster', 'Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries (e.g., automobiles and air transportation), computers have made spectacular pro- gress in a short time. During the first two decades of their existence, computer systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infre- quently, this room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the great electronic wonder inside. A medium-sized company or university might have had 1 2 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 one or two computers, while very large institutions had at most a few dozen. The idea that within forty years vastly more powerful computers smaller than postage stamps wouldbemassproducedbythebillionswas purescience fiction. The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are organized. The once-dominant concept of the ‘‘computer center’’ as a room with a large computer to which users bring their work for processing is now totally obsolete (although data centers holding thou- sands of Internet servers are becoming common). The oldmodel of a single com- puter serving all of the organization’s computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected computers do the job. These systems are called computer networks. The design and organization of these networks are thesubjects ofthisbook. Throughoutthebookwewillusetheterm ‘‘computer network’’tomean acol- lection of autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and communication satellites can also be used. Networks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see later. They are usually connected together to make larger networks, with the Internet being the most well-known example of a network ofnetworks. There is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer network and a distributed system. The key distinction is that in a distributed system, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single coherent sys- tem. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to the users. Of- ten a layer of software on top of the operating system, called middleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-known example of a distributed system is the World Wide Web. It runs on top of the Internet and presents a modelinwhich everything lookslikeadocument (Web page). Inacomputer network, thiscoherence, model, andsoftware are absent. Users are exposed to the actual machines, without any attempt by the system to make the machines lookand act inacoherent way. If the machines have different hard- ware and different operating systems, that is fully visible to the users. If a user † wants torunaprogram onaremote machine, he has tologontothat machine and runitthere. In effect, a distributed system is a software system built on top of a network. The software gives it a high degree of cohesiveness and transparency. Thus, the distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with the software (es- pecially theoperating system), rather thanwiththehardware. Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap between the two subjects', 'For ex- ample, both distributed systems and computer networks need to move files around. The difference lies inwho invokes the movement, the system or the user. †‘‘He’’shouldbereadas‘‘heorshe’’throughoutthisbook. SEC.1.1 USESOFCOMPUTERNETWORKS 3 Althoughthisbookprimarily focuses onnetworks, many ofthe topics are also im- portant in distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems, see Tanenbaum andVanSteen (2007). 1.1 USES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting some time to pointing out why people are interested in computer networks and what they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in computer net- works, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at com- panies, then move on to home networking and recent developments regarding mobile users, andfinishwithsocial issues. 1.1.1 Business Applications Most companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a company may have a computer for each worker and use them to design products, write brochures, and do the payroll. Initially, some of these computers may have worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may have decided to connect them to be able to distribute information throughout the com- pany. Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing. The goal is to make all programs, equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the resource or the user. An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share a common printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and a high-volume networked printer is often cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain thanalarge collection ofindividual printers. However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such as printers, and tape backup systems, is sharing information. Companies small and large are vitally dependent on computerized information. Most companies have customer records, product information, inventories, financial statements, tax information, andmuchmoreonline. Ifall ofits computers suddenlywent down,a bank could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, with acomputer-controlled assembly line, wouldnotlast even 5seconds. Even a small travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on computer net- works for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents instantly. For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or perhaps a single building, but for larger ones, the computers and employees may be scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many countries. Nevertheless, a sales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory 4 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 database in Singapore. Networks called VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) may be used to join the individual networks at different sites into one extended net- work. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local', 'This goal may be summarized by saying that it is an attempt to end the ‘‘tyrannyofgeography.’’ In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company’s information system as consisting of one or more databases with company information and some number of employees who need to access them remotely. In this model, the data are stor- ed on powerful computers called servers. Often these are centrally housed and maintained by a system administrator. In contrast, the employees have simpler machines, called clients, on their desks, with which they access remote data, for example, to include in spreadsheets they are constructing. (Sometimes we will refer to the human user of the client machine as the ‘‘client,’’ but it should be clear from the context whether we mean the computer or its user.) The client and server machines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig. 1-1. Note that we have shown the network as a simple oval, without any detail. We willuse this form when we mean a network in the most abstract sense. When more detail is required, itwillbeprovided. Client Server Network Figure1-1. Anetworkwithtwoclientsandoneserver. This whole arrangement is called the client-server model. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network usage. The most popular realization is that ofaWeb application,inwhich the server generates Web pages based onits data- base inresponsetoclient requests thatmayupdatethedatabase. The client-server model is applicable when the client and server are both in the same building (and belong to the same company), but also when they are far apart. For example, when a person at home accesses a page on the World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web server being the server and the user’s personal SEC. 1.1 USESOFCOMPUTERNETWORKS 5 computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large number (hundredsorthousands)ofclients simultaneously. If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes (i.e., running programs) are involved, one on the client machine and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These messages are showninFig.1-2. Clientmachine Servermachine Request Network Reply Clientprocess Serverprocess Figure1-2. Theclient-server modelinvolvesrequestsandreplies. A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather than information or even computers. A computer network can provide a powerful communication medium among employees. Virtually every company that has two ormore computers nowhas email (electronic mail),which employees gener- ally use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe around the water cooler is how much email everyone has to deal with, much of it quite meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the same (often content-free)message toalltheir subordinatesatthepushofabutton. Telephone calls between employees may be carried by the computer network instead of by the phone company', 'This technology is called IP telephony or Voice over IP (VoIP) when Internet technology is used. The microphone and speaker at each end may belong to a VoIP-enabled phone or the employee’s com- puter. Companies findthisawonderfulwaytosave ontheir telephonebills. Other, richer forms of communication are made possible by computer net- works. Video can be added toaudio sothat employees atdistant locations cansee and hear each other as they hold a meeting. This technique is a powerful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. Desktop sharing lets remote workers see and interact with a graphical computer screen. This makes it easy for two or more people who work far apart to read and write a shared black- board or write a report together. When one worker makes a change to an online document, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several days for a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of people easy where it previously had been impossible. More ambitious forms of remote coordination such as telemedicine are only now starting to be used (e.g., 6 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 remote patient monitoring) but may become much more important. It is some- times said that communication and transportation are having a race, and which- ever winswillmake theotherobsolete. A third goal for many companies is doing business electronically, especially with customers and suppliers. This new model is called e-commerce (electronic commerce) and it has grown rapidly in recent years. Airlines, bookstores, and other retailers have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shop- ping from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goods and services online and take orders online. Manufacturers of automobiles, air- craft, and computers, among others, buy subsystems from a variety of suppliers and then assemble the parts. Using computer networks, manufacturers can place orders electronically as needed. This reduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency. 1.1.2 Home Applications In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then the number twocomputer vendorinthe world(after IBM). When asked whyDig- ital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way, he said: ‘‘There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.’’ History showed otherwise and Digital no longer exists. People initially bought computers for word processing and games. Recently, the biggest reason to buya home com- puter was probably for Internet access. Now, many consumer electronic devices, such as set-top boxes, game consoles, and clock radios, come with embedded computers and computer networks, especially wireless networks, and home net- works are broadly used for entertainment, including listening to, looking at, and creating music, photos,andvideos. Internet access provides home users with connectivity to remote computers. As with companies, home users can access information, communicate with other people, and buy products and services with e-commerce. The main benefit now comes from connecting outside ofthe home', 'BobMetcalfe, the inventor ofEther- net, hypothesized that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users because this is roughly the number of different connections that may be made (Gilder, 1993). This hypothesis is known as ‘‘Metcalfe’s law.’’ It helps to explain how the tremendous popularity of the Internet comes from its size. Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the World Wide Web for information or just for fun. Information available includes the arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies, recreation, sci- ence, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention, plussomeways thatare better left unmentioned. Many newspapers have gone online and can be personalized. For example, it is sometimes possible to tell a newspaper that you want everything about corrupt SEC. 1.1 USESOFCOMPUTERNETWORKS 7 politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and epidemics, but no foot- ball, thank you. Sometimes it is possible tohave the selected articles downloaded to your computer while you sleep. As this trend continues, it will cause massive unemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because dis- tribution has always been the weakest link in the whole production chain. Of course, to make this model work, they will first have to figure out how to make money in this new world, something not entirely obvious since Internet users expect everything tobefree. The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is the online digital library. Many professional organizations, such as the ACM (www.acm.org) and the IEEE Computer Society (www.computer.org), already have all their journals and conference proceedings online. Electronic book read- ers and online libraries may make printed books obsolete. Skeptics should take noteoftheeffect theprintingpresshadonthemedieval illuminatedmanuscript. Much of this information is accessed using the client-server model, but there is different, popular model for accessing information that goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individu- als who form a loose group can communicate with others in the group, as shown in Fig.1-3. Every person can, in principle, communicate with one or more other people; there isnofixeddivisionintoclients andservers. Figure1-3. Inapeer-to-peer systemtherearenofixedclientsandservers. Many peer-to-peer systems, such BitTorrent (Cohen, 2003), do not have any central database of content. Instead, each user maintains his own database locally andprovides a list ofother nearby people whoare members ofthe system. A new user can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get the names of other members to inspect for more content and more names. This lookup process can be repeated indefinitely tobuild upa large local database of what is out there. Itisanactivity thatwouldgettediousforpeople butcomputers excel atit. 8 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Peer-to-peer communication is often used toshare music and videos. It really hit the big time around 2000 with a music sharing service called Napster that was shut down after what was probably the biggest copyright infringement case in all of recorded history (Lam and Tan, 2001; and Macedonia, 2000). Legal applica- tions for peer-to-peer communication also exist', 'These include fans sharing pub- lic domain music, families sharing photos and movies, and users downloading public software packages. In fact,one ofthemost popular Internet applications ofall, email,is inherently peer-to-peer.This form of communication is likely to growconsiderably inthefuture. All of the above applications involve interactions between a person and a re- mote database full of information. The second broad category of network use is person-to-person communication, basically the 21st century’s answer to the 19th century’s telephone. E-mail is already used on a daily basis bymillionsof people all over the world and its use is growing rapidly. It already routinely contains audioandvideoaswell astextandpictures. Smell maytake awhile. Any teenager worth his or her salt is addicted to instant messaging. This facility, derived fromtheUNIX talk program inuse since around1970,allows two people to type messages at each other in real time. There are multi-person mes- saging services too, such as the Twitter service that lets people send short text messages called ‘‘tweets’’totheir circle offriends orotherwillingaudiences. The Internet can be used by applications to carry audio (e.g., Internet radio stations) and video (e.g., YouTube). Besides being a cheap way to call to distant friends, these applications can provide rich experiences such as telelearning, meaning attending 8A.M. classes without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. In the long run, the use of networks to enhance human-to-human communication may prove more important than any of the others. It may become hugely important to people who are geographically challenged, giving them the same accesstoservices aspeople livinginthemiddleofabigcity. Between person-to-person communications and accessing information are social network applications. Here, the flow of information is driven by the rela- tionships that people declare between each other. One of the most popular social networking sites is Facebook. It lets people update their personal profiles and shares the updates with other people who they have declared to be their friends. Other social networking applications can make introductions via friends of friends, sendnews messages tofriends suchasTwitterabove,andmuchmore. Even more loosely, groups of people can work together to create content. A wiki, for example, is a collaborative Web site that the members of a community edit. The most famous wiki is the Wikipedia, an encyclopedia anyone can edit, butthere are thousandsofother wikis. Our third category is electronic commerce in the broadest sense of the term. Home shoppingis already popular and enables users toinspect the online catalogs of thousands of companies. Some of these catalogs are interactive, showing pro- ducts from different viewpoints and in configurations that can be personalized. SEC. 1.1 USESOFCOMPUTERNETWORKS 9 After the customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it,onlinetechnical supportmaybeconsulted. Another area in which e-commerce is widely used is access to financial insti- tutions. Many people already pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This trend will surely continue as net- worksbecome more secure. One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?). Online auctions of second-hand goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model, online auctions are peer-to-peer inthesense thatconsumers canact asbothbuyersandsellers', 'Some of these forms of e-commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ‘‘to’’ and ‘‘2’’ are pronounced the same. The most popular ones are listed inFig.1-4.

Someformsofe-commerce. Our fourth category is entertainment. This has made huge strides in the home in recent years, with the distribution of music, radio and television programs, and movies over the Internet beginning to rival that of traditional mechanisms. Users can find, buy, and download MP3 songs and DVD-quality movies and add them to their personal collection. TV shows now reach many homes via IPTV (IP TeleVision) systems that are based on IP technology instead of cable TV or radio transmissions. Media streaming applications let users tune into Internet radio sta- tions or watch recent episodes of their favorite TV shows. Naturally, all of this content can be moved around your house between different devices, displays and speakers, usually withawireless network. Soon, it may be possible to search for any movie or television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become interactive, with the audience participating inquiz shows, choosingamongcontestants, andso on. Another formofentertainment isgame playing. Already wehave multiperson real-time simulation games, like hide-and-seek in a virtual dungeon, and flight 10 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 simulators with the players on one team trying to shoot down the players on the opposing team. Virtual worlds provide a persistent setting in which thousands of users canexperience ashared realitywiththree-dimensional graphics. Our last category is ubiquitous computing, in which computing is embedded into everyday life, as in the vision of Mark Weiser (1991). Many homes are al- ready wired with security systems that include door and window sensors, and there are many more sensors that can be folded in to a smart home monitor, such as energy consumption. Your electricity, gas and water meters could also report usage over the network. This would save money as there would be no need to send out meter readers. And your smoke detectors could call the fire department instead of making a big noise (which has little value if no one is home). As the cost of sensing and communication drops, more and more measurement and re- portingwillbedonewithnetworks. Increasingly, consumer electronic devices are networked. For example, some high-end cameras already have a wireless network capability and use it to send photos to a nearby display for viewing. Professional sports photographers can also send their photos to their editors in real-time, first wirelessly to an access point then over the Internet. Devices such as televisions that plug into the wall can use power-line networks to send information throughout the house over the wires that carry electricity', 'It may not be very surprising to have these objects on the network, but objects that we donot think of as computers may sense andcom- municate information too. For example, your shower may record water usage, give you visual feedback while you lather up,and report to a home environmental monitoringapplication whenyouare donetohelpsave onyourwater bill. A technology called RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) will push this idea even further in the future. RFID tags are passive (i.e., have no battery) chips the size of stamps and they can already be affixed to books, passports, pets, credit cards, and other items in the home and out. This lets RFID readers locate and communicate withthe items over a distance of upto several meters, depending on the kind of RFID. Originally, RFID was commercialized to replace barcodes. It has not succeeded yet because barcodes are free and RFID tags cost a few cents. Of course, RFID tags offer much more and their price is rapidly declining. They mayturnthereal worldintotheInternet ofthings(ITU, 2005). 1.1.3 Mobile Users Mobile computers, such as laptop and handheld computers, are one of the fastest-growing segments of the computer industry. Their sales have already overtaken those of desktop computers. Why would anyone want one? People on the gooften want to use their mobile devices to read and send email, tweet, watch movies, download music, play games, or simply to surf the Web for information. They want todoall ofthe thingsthey doathomeandintheoffice. Naturally, they wanttodothemfromanywhere onland,sea orintheair. SEC. 1.1 USESOFCOMPUTERNETWORKS 11 Connectivity totheInternet enables many ofthese mobile uses. Since having a wired connection is impossible in cars, boats, and airplanes, there is a lot of interest in wireless networks. Cellular networks operated by the telephone com- panies are one familiar kind of wireless network that blankets us with coverage for mobile phones. Wireless hotspots based on the 802.11 standard are another kind of wireless network for mobile computers. They have sprung upeverywhere that people go, resulting in a patchwork of coverage at cafes, hotels, airports, schools, trains and planes. Anyone with a laptop computer and a wireless modem can just turn on their computer on and be connected to the Internet through the hotspot,asthoughthecomputer were pluggedintoawired network. Wireless networks are of great value to fleets of trucks, taxis, delivery vehi- cles, and repairpersons for keeping in contact with their home base. For example, in many cities, taxi drivers are independent businessmen, rather than being em- ployees of a taxi company. In some of these cities, the taxis have a display the driver can see. When a customer calls up,a central dispatcher types in the pickup and destination points. This information is displayed on the drivers’ displays and abeep sounds. Thefirstdriver tohitabuttononthedisplaygets thecall. Wireless networks are also important tothe military. Ifyouhave tobeable to fight a war anywhere on Earth at short notice, counting on using the local net- workinginfrastructure isprobably notagoodidea. Itisbetter tobringyourown. Although wireless networking and mobile computing are often related, they are not identical, as Fig.1-5 shows. Here we see a distinction between fixed wireless andmobile wireless networks. Even notebookcomputers are sometimes wired', 'For example, if a traveler plugs a notebook computer into the wired net- workjack inahotelroom,hehasmobilitywithoutawireless network. Wireless Mobile Typicalapplications No No Desktopcomputersinoffices No Yes Anotebookcomputerusedinahotelroom Yes No Networksinunwiredbuildings Yes Yes Storeinventorywithahandheldcomputer Figure1-5. Combinationsofwirelessnetworksandmobilecomputing. Conversely, some wireless computers are not mobile. In the home, and in offices or hotels that lack suitable cabling, it can be more convenient to connect desktop computers or media players wirelessly than to install wires. Installing a wireless network may require little more than buying a small box with some elec- tronics in it, unpacking it, and plugging it in. This solution may be far cheaper thanhavingworkmen putincable ductstowire thebuilding. Finally, there are also true mobile, wireless applications, such as people walk- ing around stores with a handheld computers recording inventory. At many busy 12 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 airports, car rental return clerks work inthe parking lot with wireless mobile com- puters. They scan the barcodes or RFID chips of returning cars, and their mobile device, which has a built-in printer, calls the main computer, gets the rental infor- mation, andprintsoutthebillonthespot. Perhaps the key driver of mobile, wireless applications is the mobile phone. Text messaging or texting is tremendously popular. It lets a mobile phone user type a short message that is then delivered by the cellular network to another mobile subscriber. Few people would have predicted ten years ago that having teenagers tediously typing short text messages on mobile phones would be an immense money maker for telephone companies. But texting (or Short Message Service asitisknownoutside the U.S.) isvery profitable since itcosts the carrier but a tiny fraction of one cent to relay a text message, a service for which they charge farmore. The long-awaited convergence of telephones and the Internet has finally arrived, and it will accelerate the growth of mobile applications. Smart phones, such as the popular iPhone, combine aspects of mobile phones and mobile com- puters. The (3G and4G) cellular networks towhich they connectcan provide fast data services for using the Internet as well as handling phone calls. Many ad- vanced phonesconnecttowireless hotspotstoo,andautomatically switch between networks tochoosethebestoptionfortheuser. Other consumer electronics devices can alsousecellular andhotspot networks to stay connected to remote computers. Electronic book readers can download a newly purchased book or the next edition of a magazine or today’s newspaper wherever they roam. Electronic picture frames can update their displays on cue withfresh images. Since mobile phones know their locations, often because they are equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers, some services are intentionally location dependent. Mobile maps and directions are an obvious candidate as your GPS-enabled phoneandcar probably have abetter idea ofwhere youare thanyou do. So, too, are searches for a nearby bookstore or Chinese restaurant, or a local weather forecast. Other services may record location, such as annotating photos and videos with the place at which they were made. This annotation is known as ‘‘geo-tagging.’’ An area in which mobile phones are now starting to be used is m-commerce (mobile-commerce) (Senn, 2000)', 'Short text messages from the mobile are used to authorize payments for food in vending machines, movie tickets, and other small items instead of cash and credit cards. The charge then appears on the mobile phone bill. When equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology the mobile can act as an RFID smartcard and interact with a nearby reader for payment. The driving forces behind this phenomenon are the mobile device makers andnetwork operators, whoare tryinghard tofigure outhowtoget a piece of the e-commerce pie. From the store’s point of view, this scheme may save them most of the credit card company’s fee, which can be several percent. SEC. 1.1 USESOFCOMPUTERNETWORKS 13 Of course, this plan may backfire, since customers in a store might use the RFID or barcode readers ontheir mobile devices tocheck outcompetitors’prices before buying and use them to get a detailed report on where else an item can be pur- chased nearby andatwhatprice. One huge thing that m-commerce has going for it is that mobile phone users are accustomed to paying for everything (in contrast to Internet users, who expect everything tobefree). IfanInternet Web sitecharged afee toallow itscustomers to pay by credit card, there would be an immense howling noise from the users. If, however, a mobile phone operator its customers to pay for items in a store by waving the phone at the cash register and then tacked on a fee for this conveni- ence, itwouldprobably beacceptedasnormal. Time willtell. No doubt the uses of mobile and wireless computers will grow rapidly in the future as the size of computers shrinks, probably in ways no one can now foresee. Let us take a quick look at some possibilities. Sensor networks are made up of nodesthatgather andwirelessly relay information theysense aboutthestate ofthe physical world. The nodes may be part of familiar items such as cars or phones, or they may be small separate devices. For example, your car might gather data on its location, speed, vibration, and fuel efficiency from its on-board diagnostic system and upload this information to a database (Hull et al., 2006). Those data can help find potholes, plan trips around congested roads, and tell youif youare a ‘‘gasguzzler’’compared toother drivers onthesame stretch ofroad. Sensor networks are revolutionizing science by providing a wealth of data on behavior that could not previously be observed. One example is tracking the migration of individual zebras by placing a small sensor on each animal (Juang et al., 2002). Researchers have packed a wireless computer into a cube 1 mm on edge (Warneke et al., 2001). With mobile computers this small, even small birds, rodents, andinsects canbetracked. Even mundane uses, such as in parking meters, can be significant because they make useofdata thatwere notpreviously available. Wireless parking meters can acceptcredit ordebitcard payments withinstant verification over the wireless link. They can also report when they are in use over the wireless network. This would let drivers download a recent parking map to their car so they can find an available spot more easily', 'Of course, when a meter expires, it might also check for the presence of a car (by bouncing a signal off it) and report the expiration to parking enforcement. It has been estimated that city governments in the U.S. alone couldcollect anadditional$10billionthisway (Harte etal., 2000). Wearable computers are another promising application. Smart watches with radios have been part of our mental space since their appearance in the Dick Tracy comic strip in 1946; now you can buy them. Other such devices may be implanted, such as pacemakers and insulin pumps. Some of these can be con- trolled over a wireless network. This lets doctors test and reconfigure them more easily. It could also lead to some nasty problems if the devices are as insecure as theaverage PCandcanbehacked easily (Halperin etal., 2008). 14 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 1.1.4 Social Issues Computer networks, like the printing press 500 years ago, allow ordinary citizens to distribute and view content in ways that were not previously possible. But along with the good comes the bad, as this new-found freedom brings with it many unsolved social, political, and ethical issues. Let us just briefly mention a few ofthem; athoroughstudywouldrequire afullbook,atleast. Social networks, message boards, content sharing sites, andahostofother ap- plications allow people toshare their views withlike-minded individuals. Aslong as the subjects are restricted to technical topics or hobbies like gardening, not too manyproblems willarise. The trouble comes with topics that people actually care about, like politics, religion, or sex. Views that are publicly posted may be deeply offensive to some people. Worse yet, they may not be politically correct. Furthermore, opinions need not be limited to text; high-resolution color photographs and video clips are easily shared over computer networks. Some people take a live-and-let-live view, but others feel that posting certain material (e.g., verbal attacks on particular countries or religions, pornography, etc.) is simply unacceptable and that such content must be censored. Different countries have different and conflicting laws inthisarea. Thus,thedebate rages. In the past, people have sued network operators, claiming that they are re- sponsible for the contents of what they carry, just as newspapers and magazines are. The inevitable response is that a network is like a telephone company or the postoffice andcannotbeexpected topolice whatitsusers say. Itshouldnowcome onlyas aslight surprise tolearn that some network opera- tors block content for their own reasons. Some users of peer-to-peer applications hadtheir network service cutoffbecausethenetwork operators didnotfindit pro- fitable to carry the large amounts of traffic sent by those applications. Those same operators would probably like to treat different companies differently. If you are a big company and pay well then you get good service, but if you are a small-time player, you get poor service. Opponents of this practice argue that peer-to-peer and other content should be treated in the same way because they are all just bits to the network. This argument for communications that are not dif- ferentiated by their content or source or who is providing the content is known as network neutrality (Wu, 2003)', 'It is probably safe to say that this debate will go onforawhile. Many other parties are involved in the tussle over content. For instance, pi- rated music and movies fueled the massive growth of peer-to-peer networks, which did not please the copyright holders, who have threatened (and sometimes taken) legal action. There are now automated systems that search peer-to-peer networks and fire off warnings to network operators and users who are suspected of infringing copyright. In the United States, these warnings are known as DMCA takedown notices after the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This SEC. 1.1 USESOFCOMPUTERNETWORKS 15 search is an arms’ race because it is hard to reliably catch copyright infringement. Even yourprinter mightbemistaken foraculprit (Piatek etal., 2008). Computer networks make it very easy to communicate. They also make it easy for the people who run the network to snoop onthe traffic. This sets upcon- flicts over issues such as employee rights versus employer rights. Many people read and write email at work. Many employers have claimed the right toread and possibly censor employee messages, including messages sent from a home com- puter outside working hours. Notall employees agree withthis,especially thelat- ter part. Another conflict is centered around government versus citizen’s rights. The FBI has installed systems at many Internet service providers to snoop on all in- coming and outgoing email for nuggets of interest. One early system was origi- nally called Carnivore, but bad publicity caused it to be renamed to the more innocent-sounding DCS1000 (Blaze and Bellovin, 2000; Sobel, 2001; and Zacks, 2001). The goal of such systems is to spy on millions of people in the hope of perhaps finding information about illegal activities. Unfortunately for the spies, the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits government searches withoutasearch warrant, butthegovernmentoftenignoresit. Of course, the government does not have a monopoly on threatening people’s privacy. The private sector does its bit too by profiling users. For example, small files called cookies that Web browsers store on users’ computers allow companies to track users’ activities in cyberspace and may also allow credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other confidential information to leak all over the Internet (Berghel, 2001). Companies that provide Web-based services may maintain large amounts of personal information about their users that allows them to study user activities directly. For example, Google can read your email and show you advertisements based on your interests if you use its email service, Gmail. A new twist with mobile devices is location privacy (Beresford and Stajano, 2003). As part of the process of providing service to your mobile device the net- work operators learn where youare at different times of day. This allows them to track your movements. They may know which nightclub you frequent and which medical center youvisit. Computer networks also offer the potential to increase privacy by sending anonymous messages. In some situations, this capability may be desirable', 'Beyondpreventing companies from learning yourhabits, it provides, for example, a way for students, soldiers, employees, and citizens to blow the whistle onillegal behavior on the part of professors, officers, superiors, and politicians without fear of reprisals. On the other hand, in the United States and most other democracies, the law specifically permits an accused person the right to confront and challenge hisaccuserincourt soanonymousaccusationscannotbeusedasevidence. The Internet makes it possible to find information quickly, but a great deal of it is ill considered, misleading, or downright wrong. That medical advice you 16 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 plucked from the Internet about the pain in your chest may have come from a NobelPrize winner orfromahigh-schooldropout. Other information is frequently unwanted. Electronic junk mail (spam) has become a part of life because spammers have collected millions of email address- es and would-be marketers can cheaply send computer-generated messages to them. The resulting flood of spam rivals the flow messages from real people. Fortunately, filtering software is able to read and discard the spam generated by other computers, withlesser orgreater degrees ofsuccess. Still other content is intended for criminal behavior. Web pages and email messages containing active content (basically, programs ormacros thatexecute on the receiver’s machine) can contain viruses that take over your computer. They might be used to steal your bank account passwords, or to have your computer sendspamaspart ofabotnet orpoolofcompromised machines. Phishing messages masquerade as originating from a trustworthy party, for example, your bank, to try to trick you into revealing sensitive information, for example, credit card numbers. Identity theft is becoming a serious problem as thieves collect enough information about a victim to obtain credit cards and other documents inthevictim’s name. It can be difficult to prevent computers from impersonating people on the In- ternet. This problem has led tothe development ofCAPTCHAs,inwhich acom- puter asks a person to solve a short recognition task, for example, typing in the letters shown in a distorted image, to show that they are human (von Ahn, 2001). This process is a variation on the famous Turing test in which a person asks ques- tionsoveranetwork tojudgewhether theentityrespondingishuman. A lot of these problems could be solved if the computer industry took com- puter security seriously. If all messages were encrypted and authenticated, it would be harder to commit mischief. Such technology is well established and we will study it in detail in Chap. 8. The problem is that hardware and software ven- dors know that putting in security features costs money and their customers are not demanding such features. In addition, a substantial number of the problems are caused by buggy software, which occurs because vendors keep adding more and more features to their programs, which inevitably means more code and thus more bugs. A tax on new features might help, but that might be a tough sell in some quarters. A refund for defective software might be nice, except it would bankrupt theentire software industryinthefirstyear. Computer networks raise new legal problems when they interact with old laws. Electronic gambling provides an example', 'Computers have been simulating things for decades, so why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack dealers, and more gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other places (England, for ex- ample) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling. What happens if the gambler, the casino, and the server are all in different coun- tries, withconflicting laws? Goodquestion. SEC. 1.2 NETWORK HARDWARE 17 1.2 NETWORK HARDWARE It is now time to turn our attention from the applications and social aspects of networking (the dessert) to the technical issues involved in network design (the spinach). There is no generally accepted taxonomy into which all computer net- works fit, but twodimensions stand outas important: transmission technologyand scale. We willnowexamine eachofthese inturn. Broadly speaking, there are two types of transmission technology that are in widespread use: broadcast linksandpoint-to-pointlinks. Point-to-point links connect individual pairs of machines. To go from the source to the destination on a network made up of point-to-point links, short mes- sages, called packets incertain contexts, may have tofirst visit one or more inter- mediate machines. Often multiple routes, of different lengths, are possible, so finding good ones is important in point-to-point networks. Point-to-point transmission with exactly one sender and exactly onereceiver is sometimes called unicasting. In contrast, on a broadcast network, the communication channel is shared by all the machines on the network; packets sent by any machine are received by all the others. An address field within each packet specifies the intended recipient. Upon receiving a packet, a machine checks the address field. If the packet is in- tended for the receiving machine, that machine processes the packet; if the packet isintended forsome othermachine, itisjustignored. A wireless network is a common example of a broadcast link, with communi- cation shared over a coverage region that depends onthe wireless channel and the transmitting machine. As an analogy, consider someone standing in a meeting room and shouting ‘‘Watson, come here. I want you.’’ Although the packet may actually bereceived(heard) bymanypeople, onlyWatson willrespond;the others justignoreit. Broadcast systems usually also allow the possibility of addressing a packet to all destinations by using a special code in the address field. When a packet with this code is transmitted, it is received and processed by every machine on the net- work. This mode of operation is called broadcasting. Some broadcast systems also support transmission to a subset of the machines, which known as multicast- ing. An alternative criterion for classifying networks is by scale. Distance is im- portant as a classification metric because different technologies are used at dif- ferent scales. In Fig.1-6 we classify multiple processor systems by their rough physical size. At the top are the personal area networks, networks that are meant for one person. Beyond these come longer-range networks. These can be divided into local, metropolitan, and wide area networks, each with increasing scale. Finally, the connectionoftwoor more networks iscalled an internetwork. The worldwide Internet is certainly the best-known(butnotthe only) example ofaninternetwork', '18 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Soon we will have even larger internetworks with the Interplanetary Internet thatconnectsnetworks across space(Burleigh etal., 2003).

In the following sections, wegiveabrief introductiontonetwork hardware byscale. 1.2.1 Personal Area Networks PANs (Personal Area Networks) let devices communicate over the range of a person. A common example is a wireless network that connects a computer with its peripherals. Almost every computer has an attached monitor, keyboard, mouse, and printer. Without using wireless, this connection must be done with cables. So many new users have ahard time finding the right cables and plugging them into the right little holes (even though they are usually color coded) that mostcomputer vendorsoffer the optionofsending atechnician tothe user’s home to doit. To help these users, some companies gottogether todesign ashort-range wireless network called Bluetooth to connect these components without wires. The idea isthat ifyourdevices have Bluetooth, then youneed nocables. Youjust put them down, turn them on,and they work together. For many people, this ease ofoperation isabigplus. In the simplest form, Bluetooth networks use the master-slave paradigm of Fig.1-7. The system unit (the PC) is normally the master, talking to the mouse, keyboard, etc., as slaves. The master tells the slaves what addresses to use, when they can broadcast, how long they can transmit, what frequencies they can use, andsoon. Bluetooth can be used in other settings, too. It is often used to connect a headset toamobile phonewithoutcordsanditcanallow yourdigital musicplayer SEC. 1.2 NETWORK HARDWARE 19 Figure1-7.

A completely different kind of PAN is formed when an embedded medical device such as a pacemaker, insulin pump, or hearing aid talks to a user-operated remote control. We will dis- cussBluetooth inmoredetail inChap. 4. PANs can also be built with other technologies that communicate over short ranges, such as RFID on smartcards and library books. We will study RFID in Chap. 4. 1.2.2 Local Area Networks The next step up is the LAN (Local Area Network). A LAN is a privately owned network that operates within and nearby a single building like a home, of- fice or factory. LANs are widely used to connect personal computers and consu- mer electronics to let them share resources (e.g., printers) and exchange informa- tion. WhenLANs are usedbycompanies, theyare called enterprise networks. Wireless LANs are very popular these days, especially in homes, older office buildings, cafeterias, and other places where it is too much trouble to install cables. In these systems, every computer has a radio modem and an antenna that it uses to communicate with other computers. In most cases, each computer talks to a device in the ceiling as shown in Fig.1-8(a). This device, called an AP (Access Point), wireless router, or base station, relays packets between the wireless computers and also between them and the Internet', 'Being the AP is like being the popular kid as school because everyone wants to talk to you. However, if other computers are close enough, they can communicate directly with one an- other inapeer-to-peer configuration. There is a standard for wireless LANs called IEEE 802.11, popularly known as WiFi, which has become very widespread. It runs at speeds anywhere from 11 20 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Access Towirednetwork Ethernet point Ports switch Torestof network Figure1-8. WirelessandwiredLANs.(a)802.11.(b)SwitchedEthernet. to hundreds of Mbps. (In this book we will adhere to tradition and measure line speeds in megabits/sec, where 1 Mbps is 1,000,000 bits/sec, and gigabits/sec, where 1Gbpsis1,000,000,000bits/sec.) We willdiscuss 802.11inChap. 4. Wired LANs use a range of different transmission technologies. Most of them use copper wires, but some use optical fiber. LANs are restricted in size, which means that the worst-case transmission time is bounded and known in ad- vance. Knowing these boundshelps with the task ofdesigning network protocols. Typically, wired LANs run at speeds of 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, have low delay (microseconds or nanoseconds), and make very few errors. Newer LANs can op- erate atupto10Gbps. Compared towireless networks, wired LANs exceedthem in all dimensions of performance. It is just easier to send signals over a wire or throughafiber thanthroughtheair. The topology of many wired LANs is built from point-to-point links. IEEE 802.3, popularly called Ethernet, is, by far, the most common type of wired LAN. Fig. 1-8(b) shows a sample topology of switched Ethernet. Each com- puter speaks the Ethernet protocol and connects to a box called a switch with a point-to-point link. Hence the name. A switch has multiple ports, each of which can connect to one computer. The job of the switch is to relay packets between computers that are attached to it, using the address in each packet to determine whichcomputer tosenditto. To build larger LANs, switches can be plugged into each other using their ports. What happens if you plug them together in a loop? Will the network still work? Luckily, the designers thought of this case. It is the job of the protocol to sort out what paths packets should travel to safely reach the intended computer. We willsee howthisworksinChap. 4. It is also possible to divide one large physical LAN into two smaller logical LANs. Youmight wonderwhythis wouldbeuseful. Sometimes, thelayoutofthe network equipment does not match the organization’s structure. For example, the SEC. 1.2 NETWORK HARDWARE 21 engineering and finance departments of a company might have computers on the same physicalLAN because they are inthe same wingofthe building butitmight be easier to manage the system if engineering and finance logically each had its own network Virtual LAN or VLAN. In this design each port is tagged with a ‘‘color,’’ say green for engineering and red for finance. The switch then forwards packets so that computers attached to the green ports are separated from the com- puters attached tothe red ports. Broadcast packets sent ona red port, forexample, will not be received on a green port, just as though there were two different LANs. We willcover VLANs attheendofChap. 4', 'There are other wired LAN topologies too. In fact, switched Ethernet is a modern version of the original Ethernet design that broadcast all the packets over a single linear cable. At most one machine could successfully transmit at a time, and a distributed arbitration mechanism was used to resolve conflicts. It used a simple algorithm: computers could transmit whenever the cable was idle. If two ormore packets collided,eachcomputer justwaited arandomtime andtried later. We will call that version classic Ethernet for clarity, and as you suspected, you willlearn aboutitinChap. 4. Both wireless and wired broadcast networks can be divided into static and dynamic designs, depending on how the channel is allocated. A typical static al- location would be to divide time into discrete intervals and use a round-robin al- gorithm, allowing each machine to broadcast only when its time slot comes up. Static allocation wastes channel capacity when a machine has nothing to say dur- ing its allocated slot, so most systems attempt to allocate the channel dynamically (i.e., ondemand). Dynamic allocation methods for a common channel are either centralized or decentralized. In the centralized channel allocation method, there is a single enti- ty, for example, the base station in cellular networks, which determines who goes next. It might do this by accepting multiple packets and prioritizing them accord- ing to some internal algorithm. In the decentralized channel allocation method, there is no central entity; each machine must decide for itself whether to transmit. You might think that this approach would lead to chaos, but it does not. Later we willstudymanyalgorithms designed tobringorderoutofthepotential chaos. It is worth spending a little more time discussing LANs in the home. In the future, it is likely that every appliance in the home will be capable of communi- cating with every other appliance, and all of them will be accessible over the In- ternet. This development is likely to be one of those visionary concepts that nobody asked for (like TV remote controls or mobile phones), but once they arrived nobodycanimagine howtheylivedwithoutthem. Many devices are already capable of being networked. These include com- puters, entertainment devices such as TVs and DVDs, phones and other consumer electronics such as cameras, appliances like clock radios, and infrastructure like utility meters and thermostats. This trend will only continue. For instance, the average homeprobably hasadozen clocks (e.g., inappliances), all ofwhich could 22 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 adjust to daylight savings time automatically if the clocks were on the Internet. Remote monitoring ofthe home is a likely winner, as many grown children would be willing to spend some money to help their aging parents live safely in their ownhomes. While we could think of the home network as just another LAN, it is more likely to have different properties than other networks. First, the networked de- vices have to be very easy to install. Wireless routers are the most returned con- sumer electronic item', 'People buy one because they want a wireless network at home, find that it does not work ‘‘out of the box,’’ and then return it rather than listen toelevator music while onholdonthetechnical helpline. Second, the network and devices have to be foolproof in operation. Air con- ditioners used to have one knob with four settings: OFF, LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH. Now they have 30-page manuals. Once they are networked, expect the chapter on security alone to be 30 pages. This is a problem because only com- puter users are accustomed to putting up with products that do not work; the car-, television-, and refrigerator-buying public is far less tolerant. They expect pro- ductstowork100%withouttheneedtohireageek. Third, low price is essential for success. People will not pay a $50 premium for an Internet thermostat because few people regard monitoring their home tem- perature fromworkthatimportant. For$5extra, though,itmightsell. Fourth, it mustbe possible tostart outwith oneor two devices and expand the reach of the network gradually. This means no format wars. Telling consumers to buy peripherals with IEEE 1394 (FireWire) interfaces and a few years later retracting that and saying USB 2.0 is the interface-of-the-month and then switch- ingthat to802.11g—oops,no,make that 802.11n—I mean 802.16 (different wire- less networks)—is going to make consumers very skittish. The network interface willhavetoremain stable fordecades,like thetelevision broadcasting standards. Fifth, security and reliability will be very important. Losing a few files to an email virus is one thing; having a burglar disarm your security system from his mobile computer andthenplunderyourhouseissomething quitedifferent. An interesting question is whether home networks will be wired or wireless. Convenience and cost favors wireless networking because there are no wires to fit, or worse, retrofit. Security favors wired networking because the radio waves that wireless networks use are quite goodat going throughwalls. Not everyone is overjoyed at the thought of having the neighbors piggybacking on their Internet connection and reading their email. In Chap. 8 we will study how encryption can be used to provide security, but it is easier said than done with inexperienced users. A third option that may be appealing is to reuse the networks that are already in the home. The obvious candidate is the electric wires that are installed throughout the house. Power-line networks let devices that plug into outlets broadcast information throughout the house. You have to plugin the TV anyway, and this way it can get Internet connectivity at the same time. The difficulty is SEC. 1.2 NETWORK HARDWARE 23 how to carry both power and data signals at the same time. Part of the answer is thattheyusedifferent frequency bands. In short, home LANs offer many opportunities and challenges. Most of the latter relate to the need for the networks to be easy to manage, dependable, and secure, especially inthehandsofnontechnicalusers, aswell aslowcost. 1.2.3 Metropolitan Area Networks A MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) covers a city. The best-known ex- amples of MANs are the cable television networks available in many cities. These systems grew from earlier community antenna systems used in areas with poorover-the-air television reception', 'Inthose early systems, alarge antenna was placed on top of a nearby hill and a signal was then piped to the subscribers’ houses. At first, these were locally designed, ad hoc systems. Then companies began jumping into the business, gettingcontracts fromlocal governmentstowire upen- tire cities. The next step was television programming and even entire channels designed for cable only. Often these channels were highly specialized, such as all news, all sports, all cooking, all gardening, and so on. But from their inception untilthelate 1990s,theywere intended fortelevision receptiononly. When the Internet began attracting a mass audience, the cable TV network operators began to realize that with some changes to the system, they could pro- vide two-way Internet service in unused parts of the spectrum. At that point, the cable TV system began to morph from simply a way to distribute television to a metropolitan area network. To a first approximation, a MAN might look some- thing like the system shown in Fig.1-9. In this figure we see both television sig- nals and Internet being fed into the centralized cable headend for subsequent dis- tribution to people’s homes. We will come back to this subject in detail in Chap. 2. Cable television is not the only MAN, though. Recent developments in high- speed wireless Internet access have resulted in another MAN, which has been standardized as IEEE 802.16 and is popularly known as WiMAX. We will look atitinChap. 4. 1.2.4 Wide Area Networks A WAN (Wide Area Network) spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent. We will begin our discussion with wired WANs, using the example ofacompany withbranch offices indifferent cities. The WAN inFig.1-10isa network that connects offices in Perth, Melbourne, and Brisbane. Each of these offices contains computers intended for running user (i.e., application) programs. We will follow traditional usage and call these ma- chines hosts. The rest of the network that connects these hosts is then called the 24 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Junction box Antenna Headend Internet Figure1-9. AmetropolitanareanetworkbasedoncableTV. communication subnet,orjustsubnetforshort. The jobofthe subnetistocarry messages from host to host, just as the telephone system carries words (really just sounds)fromspeaker tolistener. In most WANs, the subnet consists of two distinct components: transmission lines and switching elements. Transmission lines move bits between machines. They can be made of copper wire, optical fiber, or even radio links. Most com- panies do not have transmission lines lying about, so instead they lease the lines from a telecommunications company. Switching elements, or just switches, are specialized computers that connect two or more transmission lines. When data arrive onanincoming line, theswitching element mustchooseanoutgoing line on which to forward them. These switching computers have been called by various names in the past; the name router is now most commonly used. Unfortunately, some people pronounce it ‘‘rooter’’ while others have it rhyme with ‘‘doubter.’’ Determining the correct pronunciation will be left as an exercise for the reader. (Note: theperceived correct answer maydepend onwhere youlive.) A short comment about the term ‘‘subnet’’ is in order here', 'Originally, its only meaning was the collection of routers and communication lines that moved packets fromthesource hosttothe destination host. Readers shouldbeaware that it has acquired a second, more recent meaning in conjunction with network ad- dressing. We will discuss that meaning in Chap. 5 and stick with the original meaning (acollection oflines androuters) untilthen. The WAN as we have described it looks similar to a large wired LAN, but there are some important differences that go beyond long wires. Usually in a WAN, the hosts and subnet are owned and operated by different people. In our SEC. 1.2 NETWORK HARDWARE 25 Subnet Transmission line Brisbane Router Perth Melbourne Figure1-10. WANthatconnectsthreebranchofficesinAustralia. example, the employees might be responsible for their own computers, while the company’s IT department is in charge of the rest of the network. We will see clearer boundariesinthe coming examples, in which the network provider or tele- phone company operates the subnet. Separation of the pure communication aspects ofthe network (the subnet)fromthe application aspects (the hosts) greatly simplifies theoverall network design. A second difference is that the routers will usually connect different kinds of networking technology. The networks inside the offices may be switched Ether- net, for example, while the long-distance transmission lines may be SONET links (which we will cover in Chap. 2). Some device needs to join them. The astute reader will notice that this goes beyond our definition of a network. This means that many WANs will in fact be internetworks, or composite networks that are made up of more than one network. We will have more to say about internet- worksinthenextsection. A final difference is in what is connected to the subnet. This could be indivi- dual computers, as was the case for connecting to LANs, or it could be entire LANs. Thisishowlarger networks are builtfromsmaller ones. Asfar as the sub- netisconcerned, itdoesthesame job. We are nowina positiontolookat twoother varieties ofWANs. First, rather than lease dedicated transmission lines, acompany mightconnectitsoffices tothe Internet This allows connections to be made between the offices as virtual links 26 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 that use the underlying capacity of the Internet. This arrangement, shown in Fig.1-11, is called a VPN (Virtual Private Network). Compared to the dedi- cated arrangement, a VPN has the usual advantage of virtualization, which is that it provides flexible reuse ofaresource (Internet connectivity). Consider how easy it is to add a fourth office to see this. A VPN also has the usual disadvantage of virtualization, which is a lack of control over the underlying resources. With a dedicated line, the capacity is clear. With a VPN your mileage may vary with yourInternet service. Internet Linkviathe internet Brisbane Perth Melbourne Figure1-11. WANusingavirtualprivatenetwork. The second variation is that the subnet may be run by a different company. The subnet operator is known as a network service provider and the offices are its customers. This structure is shown in Fig.1-12. The subnet operator will con- nect to other customers too, as long as they can pay and it can provide service', 'Since it would be a disappointing network service if the customers could only send packets toeachother, the subnetoperator willalso connecttoother networks that are part of the Internet. Such a subnet operator is called an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and the subnet is an ISP network. Its customers who connect totheISPreceiveInternet service. We can use the ISP network to preview some key issues that we will study in later chapters. In most WANs, the network contains many transmission lines, each connecting a pair of routers. If two routers that do not share a transmission line wish to communicate, they must do this indirectly, via other routers. There SEC. 1.2 NETWORK HARDWARE 27 ISPnetwork Transmission line Brisbane Customer network Perth Melbourne Figure1-12. WANusinganISPnetwork. may be many paths in the network that connect these two routers. How the net- work makes the decision as to which path to use is called the routing algorithm. Many such algorithms exist. How each router makes the decision as to where to send a packet next is called the forwarding algorithm. Many of them exist too. We willstudysomeofbothtypesindetail inChap. 5. Other kinds of WANs make heavy use of wireless technologies. In satellite systems, each computer on the ground has an antenna through which it can send data to and receive data from to a satellite in orbit. All computers can hear the output from the satellite, and in some cases they can also hear the upward transmissions of their fellow computers to the satellite as well. Satellite networks are inherently broadcast and are most useful when the broadcast property is im- portant. The cellular telephone network is another example of a WAN that uses wire- less technology. This system has already gone through three generations and a fourth one is on the horizon. The first generation was analog and for voice only. The second generation was digital andforvoice only. The third generation isdig- ital and is for both voice and data. Each cellular base station covers a distance much larger than awireless LAN, witha range measured inkilometers rather than tens of meters. The base stations are connected to each other by a backbone net- work that is usually wired. The data rates of cellular networks are often on the order of 1 Mbps, much smaller than a wireless LAN that can range up to on the orderof100Mbps. We willhave alottosayaboutthese networks inChap. 2. 28 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 1.2.5 Internetworks Manynetworks exist inthe world, often withdifferent hardware and software. People connectedtoone network often want tocommunicate withpeople attached to a different one. The fulfillment of this desire requires that different, and fre- quently incompatible, networks be connected. A collection of interconnected net- works is called an internetwork or internet. These terms will be used in a gen- eric sense, in contrast to the worldwide Internet (which is one specific internet), which we will always capitalize. The Internet uses ISP networks to connect en- terprise networks, home networks, and many other networks. We will look at the Internet ingreat detail later inthisbook. Subnets, networks, and internetworks are often confused', 'The term ‘‘subnet’’ makes the most sense in the context of a wide area network, where it refers to the collection ofrouters andcommunication lines owned bythe network operator. As an analogy, the telephone system consists of telephone switching offices connect- ed to one another by high-speed lines, and to houses and businesses by low-speed lines. These lines and equipment, owned and managed by the telephone com- pany, form the subnet of the telephone system. The telephones themselves (the hostsinthisanalogy)are notpart ofthesubnet. A network is formed by the combination of a subnet and its hosts. However, the word ‘‘network’’ is often used in a loose sense as well. A subnetmight be de- scribed as a network, as in the case of the ‘‘ISP network’’ of Fig.1-12. An inter- network might also be described as a network, as in the case of the WAN in Fig.1-10. We will follow similar practice, and if we are distinguishing a network from other arrangements, we will stick with our original definition of a collection ofcomputers interconnectedbyasingle technology. Let us say more about what constitutes an internetwork. We know that an in- ternet is formed when distinct networks are interconnected. In our view, connect- ingaLAN andaWAN orconnectingtwoLANs isthe usual way toforman inter- network, but there is little agreement in the industryover terminology inthis area. There are two rules of thumb that are useful. First, if different organizations have paid to construct different parts of the network and each maintains its part, we have aninternetwork rather than a single network. Second,if the underlyingtech- nology is different in different parts (e.g., broadcast versus point-to-point and wired versuswireless), weprobablyhave aninternetwork. To go deeper, we need to talk about how two different networks can be con- nected. The general name for a machine that makes a connection between two or more networks and provides the necessary translation, both in terms of hardware and software, is a gateway. Gateways are distinguished by the layer at which they operate in the protocol hierarchy. We willhave much more tosay about lay- ers and protocol hierarchies starting in the next section, but for now imagine that higher layers are more tied to applications, such as the Web, and lower layers are more tiedtotransmission links,suchasEthernet. SEC. 1.2 NETWORK HARDWARE 29 Since the benefit of forming an internet is to connect computers across net- works, we do not want to use too low-level a gateway or we will be unable to make connections between different kinds of networks. We do not want to use toohigh-level a gateway either, ortheconnectionwillonlyworkforparticular ap- plications. The level inthe middle that is ‘‘just right’’ is often called the network layer, and a router is a gateway that switches packets at the network layer. We can nowspotaninternet byfindinganetwork thathasrouters. 1.3 NETWORK SOFTWARE The first computer networks were designed with the hardware as the main concern and the software as an afterthought. This strategy no longer works. Net- work software isnow highly structured. In the following sections we examine the software structuring technique in some detail', 'The approach described here forms thekeystone oftheentire bookandwilloccur repeatedly later on. 1.3.1 Protocol Hierarchies To reduce their design complexity, most networks are organized as a stack of layers or levels, each one built upon the one below it. The number of layers, the name of each layer, the contents of each layer, and the function of each layer dif- fer from network to network. The purpose of each layer is to offer certain ser- vices to the higher layers while shielding those layers from the details of how the offered services are actually implemented. In a sense, each layer is a kind of vir- tualmachine, offering certain services tothelayer aboveit. This concept is actually a familiar one and is used throughout computer sci- ence, where it is variously known as information hiding, abstract data types, data encapsulation, and object-oriented programming. The fundamental idea is that a particular piece of software (or hardware) provides a service to its users butkeeps thedetails ofitsinternal state andalgorithms hiddenfromthem. When layer nonone machine carries onaconversationwith layer nonanoth- er machine, the rules and conventions used in this conversation are collectively known as the layer n protocol. Basically, a protocol is an agreement between the communicating parties on how communication is to proceed. As an analogy, when a woman is introduced to a man, she may choose to stick out her hand. He, in turn, may decide to either shake it or kiss it, depending, for example, onwheth- er she is an American lawyer at a business meeting or a European princess at a formal ball. Violating the protocol will make communication more difficult, if notcompletely impossible. A five-layer network is illustrated in Fig.1-13. The entities comprising the corresponding layers on different machines are called peers. The peers may be 30 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 software processes, hardware devices, or even human beings. In other words, it is thepeers thatcommunicate byusingtheprotocol totalktoeachother.

Layers,protocols,andinterfaces. In reality, no data are directly transferred from layer n on one machine to layer n on another machine. Instead, each layer passes data and control infor- mation tothe layer immediately below it, until the lowest layer is reached. Below layer 1 is the physical medium through which actual communication occurs. In Fig.1-13, virtual communication is shown by dotted lines and physical communi- cation bysolidlines. Between each pair of adjacent layers is an interface. The interface defines which primitive operations and services the lower layer makes available to the upper one. When network designers decide how many layers to include in a net- work and what each one should do, one of the most important considerations is defining clean interfaces between the layers. Doing so, in turn, requires that each layer perform a specific collection of well-understood functions', 'In addition to minimizing the amount of information that must be passed between layers, clear- cut interfaces also make itsimpler toreplaceonelayer withacompletely different protocol or implementation (e.g., replacing all the telephone lines by satellite channels) because all that is required of the new protocol or implementation is that it offer exactly the same set of services to its upstairs neighbor as the old one did. It is common that different hosts use different implementations of the same protocol (often written by different companies). In fact, the protocol itself can change insomelayer withoutthelayers aboveandbelowiteven noticing. SEC. 1.3 NETWORK SOFTWARE 31 A set of layers and protocols is called a network architecture. The specif- ication of an architecture must contain enough information to allow an imple- menter to write the program or build the hardware for each layer so that it will correctly obey the appropriate protocol. Neither the details of the implementation nor the specification of the interfaces is part of the architecture because these are hidden away inside the machines and not visible from the outside. It is not even necessary that the interfaces on all machines in a network be the same, provided that each machine can correctly use all the protocols. A list of the protocols used by a certain system, one protocol per layer, is called a protocol stack. Network architectures, protocol stacks, and the protocols themselves are the principal sub- jects ofthisbook. An analogy may help explain the idea of multilayer communication. Imagine two philosophers (peer processes in layer 3), one of whom speaks Urdu and English and one of whom speaks Chinese and French. Since they have no com- mon language, they each engage a translator (peer processes at layer 2), each of whom in turn contacts a secretary (peer processes in layer 1). Philosopher 1 wishes to convey his affection for oryctolagus cuniculus to his peer. To do so, he passes a message (in English) across the 2/3 interface to his translator, saying ‘‘I like rabbits,’’ as illustrated in Fig.1-14. The translators have agreed on a neutral language known to both of them, Dutch, so the message is converted to ‘‘Ik vind konijnen leuk.’’ The choice of the language is the layer 2protocol and is upto the layer 2peer processes. The translator then gives the message to a secretary for transmission, for ex- ample, by email (the layer 1 protocol). When the message arrives at the other secretary, it is passed to the local translator, who translates it into French and passes it across the 2/3 interface to the second philosopher. Note that each proto- col is completely independent of the other ones as long as the interfaces are not changed. The translators can switch from Dutch to,say, Finnish, at will,provided that they both agree and neither changes his interface with either layer 1 or layer 3. Similarly, the secretaries can switch from email to telephone without disturb- ing (or even informing) the other layers. Each process may add some information intended onlyforitspeer. Thisinformation isnotpassed uptothelayer above', \"Now consider a more technical example: how to provide communication to the toplayer ofthe five-layer network inFig.1-15. Amessage, M,isproducedby an application process running in layer 5 and given to layer 4 for transmission. Layer 4 puts a header in front of the message to identify the message and passes the result to layer 3. The header includes control information, such as addresses, to allow layer 4 on the destination machine to deliver the message. Other ex- amples of control information used in some layers are sequence numbers (in case thelower layer doesnotpreserve message order), sizes, andtimes. In many networks, no limit is placed on the size of messages transmitted in the layer 4 protocol but there is nearly always a limit imposed by the layer 3 pro- tocol. Consequently, layer 3 must break up the incoming messages into smaller 32 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 LocationA LocationB Ilike J'aime Message Philosopher rabbits bienles lapins 3 3 Information L:Dutch L:Dutch fortheremote Translator Ikvind translator Ikvind konijnen konijnen 2 2 leuk leuk Information Fax#--- fortheremote Fax#--- L:Dutch secretary Secretary L:Dutch Ikvind Ikvind 1 1 konijnen konijnen leuk leuk Figure1-14.

In this example, M is splitintotwoparts, M andM ,thatwillbetransmittedseparately. 1 2 Layer 3 decides which of the outgoing lines to use and passes the packets to layer 2. Layer 2 adds to each piece not only a header but also a trailer, and gives the resulting unit to layer 1 for physical transmission. At the receiving machine the message moves upward, fromlayer tolayer, with headers beingstripped offas itprogresses. Noneoftheheaders forlayers belownare passed uptolayer n. The important thing to understand about Fig. 1-15 is the relation between the virtual and actual communication and the difference between protocols and inter- faces. The peer processes in layer 4, for example, conceptually think of their communication as being ‘‘horizontal,’’ using the layer 4 protocol. Each one is likely to have procedures called something like SendToOtherSide and GetFrom- OtherSide, even though these procedures actually communicate with lower layers across the3/4interface,andnotwiththeother side.

Example information flow supporting virtual communication in layer5. The peer process abstraction is crucial to all network design. Using it, the unmanageable task of designing the complete network can be broken into several smaller, manageable design problems, namely, thedesignoftheindividual layers. Although Sec. 1.3 is called ‘‘Network Software,’’ it is worth pointing out that the lower layers of a protocol hierarchy are frequently implemented in hardware or firmware. Nevertheless, complex protocol algorithms are involved, even if theyare embedded (inwhole orinpart) inhardware\", '1.3.2 Design Issues for the Layers Some of the key design issues that occur in computer networks will come up inlayer after layer. Below, wewillbriefly mention themore important ones. Reliability is the design issue of making a network that operates correctly even though it is made up of a collection of components that are themselves unreliable. Think about the bits of a packet traveling through the network. There is a chance that some of these bits will be received damaged (inverted) due to fluke electrical noise, random wireless signals, hardware flaws, software bugs and soon. Howisitpossible thatwefindandfixthese errors? One mechanism for finding errors in received information uses codes for er- ror detection. Information that is incorrectly received can then be retransmitted 34 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 until it is received correctly. More powerful codes allow for error correction, where the correct message is recovered from the possibly incorrect bits that were originally received. Both of these mechanisms work by adding redundant infor- mation. They are used at low layers, to protect packets sent over individual links, andhighlayers, tocheck thattherightcontents were received. Another reliability issue is finding a working path through a network. Often there are multiple paths between a source and destination, and in a large network, there may be some links or routers that are broken. Suppose that the network is down in Germany. Packets sent from London to Rome via Germany will not get through, but we could instead send packets from London to Rome via Paris. The network shouldautomatically make thisdecision. Thistopiciscalled routing. A second design issue concerns the evolution of the network. Over time, net- works grow larger and new designs emerge that need tobe connected to the exist- ing network. We have recently seen the key structuring mechanism used to sup- port change by dividing the overall problem and hiding implementation details: protocol layering. There are manyotherstrategies aswell. Since there are many computers on the network, every layer needs a mechan- ism for identifying the senders and receivers that are involved ina particular mes- sage. This mechanism is called addressing or naming, in the low and high lay- ers, respectively. An aspect of growth is that different network technologies often have dif- ferent limitations. For example, not all communication channels preserve the order of messages sent on them, leading to solutions that number messages. An- other example is differences in the maximum size of a message that the networks can transmit. This leads to mechanisms for disassembling, transmitting, and then reassembling messages. Thisoverall topiciscalled internetworking. When networks get large, new problems arise. Cities can have traffic jams, a shortage of telephone numbers, and it is easy to get lost. Not many people have these problems in their own neighborhood, but citywide they may be a big issue. Designs that continue to work well when the network gets large are said to be scalable. A third design issue is resource allocation. Networks provide a service to hosts from their underlying resources, such as the capacity of transmission lines', 'To dothis well, they need mechanisms that divide their resources so that one host doesnotinterfere withanother toomuch. Many designs share network bandwidth dynamically, according to the short- term needs of hosts, rather than by giving each host a fixed fraction of the band- width that it may or may not use. This design is called statistical multiplexing, meaning sharing based onthe statistics of demand. Itcan beapplied at lowlayers for a single link, or at high layers for a network or even applications that use the network. An allocation problem that occurs at every level is how to keep a fast sender from swamping a slow receiver with data. Feedback from the receiver to the SEC. 1.3 NETWORK SOFTWARE 35 sender is often used. This subject is called flow control. Sometimes the problem is that the network is oversubscribed because too many computers want to send too much traffic, and the network cannot deliver it all. This overloading of the network is called congestion. One strategy is for each computer to reduce its de- mandwhenitexperiences congestion.It,too,can beusedinalllayers. It is interesting to observe that the network has more resources to offer than simply bandwidth. For uses such as carrying live video, the timeliness ofdelivery matters a great deal. Mostnetworks must provide service toapplications that want this real-time delivery at the same time that they provide service to applications that want high throughput. Quality of service is the name given to mechanisms thatreconcile these competing demands. The last major design issue is to secure the network by defending it against different kinds of threats. One of the threats we have mentioned previously is that of eavesdropping on communications. Mechanisms that provide confidentiality defend against this threat, and they are used in multiple layers. Mechanisms for authentication prevent someone from impersonating someone else. They might be used to tell fake banking Web sites from the real one, or to let the cellular net- work check that a call is really coming from your phone so that you will pay the bill. Other mechanisms for integrity prevent surreptitious changes to messages, such as altering ‘‘debit my account $10’’ to ‘‘debit my account $1000.’’ All of these designsare based oncryptography,which weshall studyinChap. 8. 1.3.3 Connection-Oriented Versus Connectionless Service Layers can offer two different types of service to the layers above them: con- nection-oriented and connectionless. In this section we will look at these two typesandexamine thedifferences between them. Connection-oriented service is modeled after the telephone system. To talk tosomeone, youpickupthephone,dialthenumber, talk, andthenhangup. Simi- larly, to use a connection-oriented network service, the service user first estab- lishes a connection, uses the connection, and then releases the connection. The essential aspect ofaconnectionisthatitacts likeatube:thesender pushes objects (bits) in at one end, and the receiver takes them out at the other end. In most cases theorderispreserved sothatthebitsarrive intheordertheywere sent. In some cases when a connection is established, the sender, receiver, and sub- net conduct a negotiation about the parameters to be used, such as maximum message size, quality of service required, and other issues', 'Typically, one side makes a proposal and the other side can accept it, reject it, or make a counter- proposal. A circuit is another name for a connection with associated resources, such as a fixed bandwidth. This dates from the telephone network in which a cir- cuitwas apathovercopperwire thatcarried aphoneconversation. In contrast to connection-oriented service, connectionless service is modeled after the postal system. Each message (letter) carries the full destination address, 36 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 and each one is routed through the intermediate nodes inside the system indepen- dent of all the subsequent messages. There are different names for messages in different contexts; a packet is a message at the network layer. When the inter- mediate nodes receive a message infull before sending it ontothe next node, this is called store-and-forward switching. The alternative, in which the onward transmission of a message at a node starts before it is completely received by the node, is called cut-through switching. Normally, when two messages are sent to the same destination, the first one sent will be the first one to arrive. However, it is possible that the first one sent can be delayed so that the second one arrives first. Each kind of service can further be characterized by its reliability. Some ser- vices are reliable inthe sense that they never lose data. Usually, areliable service is implemented by having the receiver acknowledge the receipt of each message so the sender is sure that it arrived. The acknowledgement process introduces overhead anddelays, whichare often worthitbutare sometimes undesirable. Atypical situation inwhich a reliable connection-oriented service is appropri- ate is file transfer. The owner of the file wants to be sure that all the bits arrive correctly and in the same order they were sent. Very few file transfer customers would prefer a service that occasionally scrambles or loses a few bits, even if it is muchfaster. Reliable connection-oriented service has two minor variations: message se- quences and byte streams. In the former variant, the message boundaries are pre- served. When two 1024-byte messages are sent, they arrive as two distinct 1024- byte messages, never as one 2048-byte message. In the latter, the connection is simply astream ofbytes, with nomessage boundaries. When 2048 bytes arrive at the receiver, there is no way to tell if they were sent as one 2048-byte message, two1024-bytemessages, or20481-byte messages. Ifthe pages ofa bookare sent over a network toa phototypesetter as separate messages, it might be important to preserve the message boundaries. On the other hand, to download a DVD movie, a byte stream from the server to the user’s computer is all that is needed. Mes- sage boundarieswithin themovieare notrelevant. For some applications, the transit delays introduced by acknowledgements are unacceptable. One such application is digitized voice traffic for voice over IP. It is less disruptive for telephone users to hear a bit of noise on the line from time to time than to experience a delay waiting for acknowledgements', 'Similarly, when transmitting a video conference, having a few pixels wrong is no problem, but having the image jerk along as the flow stops and starts to correct errors is irritat- ing. Not all applications require connections. For example, spammers send elec- tronic junk-mail to many recipients. The spammer probably does not want to go to the trouble of setting up and later tearing down a connection to a recipient just to send them one item. Nor is100percent reliable delivery essential, especially if it costs more. All that is needed is a way to send a single message that has a high SEC. 1.3 NETWORK SOFTWARE 37 probability of arrival, but no guarantee. Unreliable (meaning not acknowledged) connectionless service is often called datagram service, in analogy with telegram service, which also does not return an acknowledgement to the sender. Despite it being unreliable, it is the dominant form in most networks for reasons that will become clear later In other situations, the convenience of not having to establish a connection to send one message is desired, but reliability is essential. The acknowledged datagram service can be provided for these applications. It is like sending a reg- istered letter and requesting a return receipt. When the receipt comes back, the sender isabsolutely sure that the letter was delivered to the intended party and not lostalongtheway. Text messaging onmobilephonesisanexample. Still another service is the request-reply service. In this service the sender transmits a single datagram containing a request; the reply contains the answer. Request-reply is commonly used to implement communication inthe client-server model: the client issues a request and the server responds to it. For example, a mobile phone client might send a query to a map server to retrieve the map data for the current location. Figure 1-16 summarizes the types of services discussed above.

Sixdifferenttypesofservice. The concept of using unreliable communication may be confusing at first. After all, why would anyone actually prefer unreliable communication to reliable communication? First of all, reliable communication (in our sense, that is, acknowledged) may not be available ina given layer. Forexample, Ethernet does not provide reliable communication. Packets can occasionally be damaged in transit. It is up to higher protocol levels to recover from this problem. In particu- lar, manyreliable services are builtontopofanunreliable datagram service. Sec- ond,the delays inherent inprovidingareliable service maybeunacceptable,espe- cially in real-time applications such as multimedia. For these reasons, both reli- able andunreliable communication coexist. 38 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 1.3.4 Service Primitives Aservice isformally specified bya set of primitives (operations) available to user processes to access the service. These primitives tell the service to perform some action or report on an action taken by a peer entity. If the protocol stack is located in the operating system, as it often is, the primitives are normally system calls. These calls cause a trap tokernel mode, which then turnscontrol ofthe ma- chine overtotheoperating system tosendthenecessarypackets', 'The set of primitives available depends onthe nature of the service being pro- vided. The primitives for connection-oriented service are different from those of connectionless service. As a minimal example of the service primitives that might provide a reliable byte stream, consider the primitives listed in Fig.1-17. They willbefamiliartofansoftheBerkeley socket interface,asthe primitivesare asimplified versionofthatinterface. Primitive Meaning LISTEN Blockwaitingforanincomingconnection CONNECT Establishaconnectionwithawaitingpeer ACCEPT Acceptanincomingconnectionfromapeer RECEIVE Blockwaitingforanincomingmessage SEND Sendamessagetothepeer DISCONNECT Terminateaconnection Figure1-17. Six service primitives that provide a simple connection-oriented service. These primitives might be used for a request-reply interaction in a client-ser- ver environment. To illustrate how, We sketch a simple protocol that implements theservice usingacknowledgeddatagrams. First, the server executes LISTEN to indicate that it is prepared to accept in- coming connections. A common way to implement LISTEN is to make it a block- ing system call. After executing the primitive, the server process is blocked until arequest forconnectionappears. Next, the client process executes CONNECT to establish a connection with the server. The CONNECT call needs to specify who to connect to, so it might have a parameter giving the server’s address. The operating system then typically sends a packet to the peer asking it to connect, as shown by (1) in Fig.1-18. The client process issuspended untilthere isaresponse. When the packet arrives at the server, the operating system sees that the pack- et is requesting a connection. It checks to see if there is a listener, and if so it unblocks the listener. The server process can then establish the connection with theACCEPT call. This sends a response (2) back to the client process to accept the SEC. 1.3 NETWORK SOFTWARE 39 Clientmachine Servermachine (1)Connectrequest Client (2)Acceptresponse process System (3)Requestfordata process (4)Reply System calls (5)Disconnect Operating Protocol Protocol Kernel Drivers (6)Disconnect Kernel Drivers system stack stack Figure1-18. Asimpleclient-server interactionusingacknowledgeddatagrams. connection. The arrival of this response then releases the client. At this point the client andserver are bothrunningandtheyhaveaconnectionestablished. The obvious analogy between this protocol and real life is a customer (client) callingacompany’s customer service manager. Atthestart oftheday,theservice manager sits next to his telephone in case it rings. Later, a client places a call. When themanager picksupthephone,theconnectionisestablished. The nextstepisfortheserver toexecuteRECEIVE toprepare toacceptthe first request. Normally, the server does this immediately uponbeing released from the LISTEN,before the acknowledgement can get back tothe client. TheRECEIVE call blockstheserver. Then the client executes SEND to transmit its request (3) followed by the ex- ecution ofRECEIVE toget the reply. The arrival ofthe request packet at the server machine unblocks the server so it can handle the request. After it has done the work, the server uses SEND to return the answer to the client (4). The arrival of this packet unblocks the client, which can now inspect the answer. If the client hasadditionalrequests, itcan make themnow. When the client is done, it executes DISCONNECT to terminate the connection (5). Usually, an initial DISCONNECT is a blocking call, suspending the client and sending a packet to the server saying that the connection is no longer needed', 'When the server gets the packet, it also issues a DISCONNECT of its own, ack- nowledging the client and releasing the connection (6). When the server’s packet gets back totheclient machine, theclient process isreleased andtheconnectionis broken. Inanutshell, thisishowconnection-orientedcommunication works. Of course, life is not so simple. Many things can go wrong here. The timing can be wrong (e.g., theCONNECT is done before theLISTEN), packets can get lost, and much more. We will look at these issues in great detail later, but for the moment, Fig. 1-18 briefly summarizes how client-server communication might workwithacknowledgeddatagrams sothatwecan ignorelostpackets. Given that six packets are required to complete this protocol, one might wonder why a connectionless protocol is not used instead. The answer is that ina perfect world it could be, in which case only two packets would be needed: one 40 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 for the request and one for the reply. However, in the face of large messages in either direction (e.g., a megabyte file), transmission errors, and lost packets, the situation changes. If the reply consisted of hundreds of packets, some of which could be lost during transmission, how would the client know if some pieces were missing? How would the client know whether the last packet actually received was really the last packet sent? Suppose the client wanted a second file. How could it tell packet 1 from the second file from a lost packet 1 from the first file that suddenly found its way to the client? In short, in the real world, a simple re- quest-reply protocol over an unreliable network is often inadequate. In Chap. 3 we will study a variety of protocols in detail that overcome these and other prob- lems. For the moment, suffice it to say that having a reliable, ordered byte stream between processes issometimes veryconvenient. 1.3.5 The Relationship of Services to Protocols Services and protocols are distinct concepts. This distinction is so important that we emphasize it again here. A service is a set of primitives (operations) that a layer provides to the layer above it. The service defines what operations the layer is prepared to perform on behalf of its users, but it says nothing at all about how these operations are implemented. A service relates to an interface between two layers, with the lower layer being the service provider and the upper layer beingtheservice user. A protocol, in contrast, is a set of rules governing the format and meaning of the packets, or messages that are exchanged by the peer entities within a layer. Entities use protocols to implement their service definitions. They are free to change their protocols at will, provided they do not change the service visible to their users. In this way, the service and the protocol are completely decoupled. Thisisakeyconcept thatanynetwork designer shouldunderstandwell. Torepeat this crucial point, services relate tothe interfaces between layers, as illustrated in Fig.1-19. In contrast, protocols relate to the packets sent between peer entities on different machines. It is very important not to confuse the two concepts. An analogy with programming languages is worth making', 'A service is like an abstract data type oran object inan object-oriented language. Itdefines opera- tionsthatcan beperformed onanobject butdoesnotspecify howthese operations are implemented. In contrast, a protocol relates to the implementation of the ser- vice andassuchisnotvisible totheuseroftheservice. Many older protocols did not distinguish the service from the protocol. In ef- fect, atypical layer might have had aservice primitiveSENDPACKET withtheuser providing a pointer to a fully assembled packet. This arrangement meant that all changes to the protocol were immediately visible to the users. Most network de- signers nowregard suchadesignasaserious blunder.

Therelationshipbetweenaserviceandaprotocol. 1.4 REFERENCE MODELS Nowthatwehavediscussed layered networks inthe abstract, it istime tolook at some examples. We will discuss two important network architectures: the OSI reference model and the TCP/IP reference model. Although the protocols associ- ated with the OSI model are not used any more, the model itself is actually quite general and still valid, and the features discussed at each layer are still very im- portant. The TCP/IP model has the opposite properties: the model itself is not of much use but the protocols are widely used. For this reason we will look at both of them in detail. Also, sometimes you can learn more from failures than from successes. 1.4.1 The OSI Reference Model The OSI model (minus the physical medium) is shown in Fig.1-20. This model is based on a proposal developed by the International Standards Organiza- tion (ISO) as afirst step toward international standardization of the protocols used in the various layers (Day and Zimmermann, 1983). It was revised in 1995 (Day, 1995). The model is called the ISO OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Ref- erence Model because it deals with connecting open systems—that is, systems that are open for communication with other systems. We will just call it the OSI model forshort. The OSI model has seven layers. The principles that were applied to arrive at theseven layers can bebriefly summarized asfollows: 1. Alayer shouldbecreated where adifferent abstraction isneeded. 2. Each layer shouldperform awell-defined function. 3. The function of each layer should be chosen with an eye toward defining internationally standardized protocols. 42 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Layer Nameofunit exchanged Applicationprotocol 7 Application Application APDU Interface Presentationprotocol 6 Presentation Presentation PPDU Sessionprotocol 5 Session Session SPDU Transportprotocol 4 Transport Transport TPDU Communicationsubnetboundary Internalsubnetprotocol 3 Network Network Network Network Packet 2 Datalink Datalink Datalink Datalink Frame 1 Physical Physical Physical Physical Bit HostA Router Router HostB Networklayerhost-routerprotocol Datalinklayerhost-routerprotocol Physicallayerhost-routerprotocol Figure1-20. TheOSIreference model. 4. The layer boundaries should be chosen to minimize the information flowacross theinterfaces. 5. The number of layers should be large enough that distinct functions need not be thrown together in the same layer out of necessity and small enoughthatthearchitecture doesnotbecome unwieldy. Below we will discuss each layer of the model in turn, starting at the bottom layer. Note that the OSI model itself is nota network architecture because it does not specify the exact services and protocols to be used in each layer. It just tells what each layer should do', 'However, ISO has also produced standards for all the layers, although these are not part of the reference model itself. Each one has been published as a separate international standard. The model (in part) is widely usedalthoughtheassociated protocols havebeen longforgotten. SEC. 1.4 REFERENCE MODELS 43 The Physical Layer The physical layer is concerned with transmitting raw bits over a communi- cation channel. The design issues have todowith making sure that when oneside sendsa1bititisreceivedbythe other side as a 1bit, notas a0bit. Typical ques- tions here are what electrical signals should be used to represent a 1 and a 0, how many nanoseconds a bit lasts, whether transmission may proceed simultaneously in both directions, how the initial connection is established, how it is torn down when bothsides are finished, howmany pins the network connector has, and what each pin is used for. These design issues largely deal with mechanical, electrical, and timing interfaces, as well as the physical transmission medium, which lies belowthephysicallayer. The DataLink Layer The main task of the data link layer is to transform a raw transmission facil- ity into a line that appears free of undetected transmission errors. It does so by masking the real errors so the network layer does not see them. It accomplishes this task by having the sender break up the input data into data frames (typically a few hundred or a few thousand bytes) and transmit the frames sequentially. If the service isreliable, the receiverconfirms correct receiptofeachframe bysend- ingback anacknowledgement frame. Another issue that arises in the data link layer (and most of the higher layers as well) is how to keep a fast transmitter from drowning a slow receiver in data. Some traffic regulation mechanism may be needed to let the transmitter know whenthereceivercan acceptmore data. Broadcast networks have an additional issue in the data link layer: how to control access to the shared channel. A special sublayer of the data link layer, the medium accesscontrol sublayer, deals withthisproblem. The Network Layer The network layer controls theoperation ofthe subnet. Akeydesign issue is determining how packets are routed from source to destination. Routes can be based on static tables that are ‘‘wired into’’ the network and rarely changed, or more often they can be updated automatically to avoid failed components. They can also be determined at the start of each conversation, for example, a terminal session, such as a login to a remote machine. Finally, they can be highly dynam- ic,beingdetermined anew foreachpacket toreflect thecurrent network load. Iftoomany packets are present inthe subnetat the same time, they will get in one another’s way, forming bottlenecks. Handling congestion is also a responsi- bility of the network layer, in conjunction with higher layers that adapt the load 44 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 they placeonthe network. More generally, the qualityofservice provided (delay, transit time, jitter,etc.) isalsoanetwork layer issue. When a packet has to travel from one network to another to get to its destina- tion, many problems can arise. The addressing used by the second network may be different from that used by the first one', 'The second one may not accept the packet at all because it is too large. The protocols may differ, and so on. It is up to the network layer to overcome all these problems to allow heterogeneous net- workstobeinterconnected. In broadcast networks, the routing problem is simple, so the network layer is often thinorevennonexistent. The Transport Layer The basic function ofthe transport layer istoaccept data from above it, split it up into smaller units if need be, pass these to the network layer, and ensure that the pieces all arrive correctly at the other end. Furthermore, all this must be done efficiently and in a way that isolates the upper layers from the inevitable changes inthehardware technologyoverthecourse oftime. The transport layer also determines what type of service to provide to the ses- sion layer, and, ultimately, to the users of the network. The most popular type of transport connection is an error-free point-to-point channel that delivers messages or bytes in the order in which they were sent. However, other possible kinds of transport service exist, such as the transporting of isolated messages with noguar- antee about the order of delivery, and the broadcasting of messages to multiple destinations. The type of service is determined when the connection is esta- blished. (As an aside, an error-free channel is completely impossible to achieve; what people really mean by this term is that the error rate is low enough to ignore inpractice.) The transport layer is a true end-to-end layer; it carries data all the way from the source to the destination. In other words, a program on the source machine carries onaconversationwithasimilar program onthe destination machine, using the message headers and control messages. In the lower layers, each protocols is between a machine and its immediate neighbors, and not between the ultimate source and destination machines, which may be separated by many routers. The difference between layers 1 through 3, which are chained, and layers 4 through 7, whichare end-to-end, isillustratedinFig. 1-20. The Session Layer The session layer allows users on different machines to establish sessions be- tween them. Sessions offer various services, including dialog control (keeping track of whose turn it is to transmit), token management (preventing two parties fromattempting the same criticaloperation simultaneously), andsynchronization SEC. 1.4 REFERENCE MODELS 45 (checkpointing long transmissions to allow them to pick up from where they left offintheevent ofacrash andsubsequent recovery). The Presentation Layer Unlike thelower layers, which are mostlyconcerned withmoving bitsaround, the presentation layer is concerned with the syntax and semantics of the infor- mation transmitted. In order to make it possible for computers with different in- ternal data representations to communicate, the data structures to be exchanged can be defined in an abstract way, along with a standard encoding to be used ‘‘on the wire.’’ The presentation layer manages these abstract data structures and al- lows higher-level data structures (e.g., banking records) to be defined and exchanged. The Application Layer The application layer contains a variety of protocols that are commonly needed by users', 'One widely used application protocol is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), which is the basis for the World Wide Web. When a browser wants a Web page, it sends the name of the page it wants to the server hosting the page using HTTP. The server then sends the page back. Other appli- cation protocols are usedforfile transfer, electronic mail, andnetwork news. 1.4.2 The TCP/IP Reference Model Let us now turn from the OSI reference model to the reference model used in the grandparent of all wide area computer networks, the ARPANET, and its suc- cessor, the worldwide Internet. Although we will give a brief history of the ARPANET later, it is useful to mention a few key aspects of it now. The ARPANET was a research network sponsored by the DoD (U.S. Department of Defense). Iteventually connectedhundredsofuniversitiesandgovernmentinstal- lations, using leased telephone lines. When satellite and radio networks were added later, the existing protocols had trouble interworking with them, so a new reference architecture was needed. Thus, from nearly the beginning, the ability to connect multiple networks in a seamless way was one of the major design goals. This architecture later became known as the TCP/IP Reference Model, after its two primary protocols. It was first described by Cerf and Kahn (1974), and later refined and defined as a standard in the Internet community (Braden, 1989). The designphilosophybehindthemodelisdiscussed byClark (1988). Given the DoD’s worry that some of its precious hosts, routers, and internet- work gateways might get blown to pieces at a moment’s notice by an attack from the Soviet Union, another major goal was that the network be able to survive loss of subnet hardware, without existing conversations being broken off. In other 46 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 words, the DoD wanted connections to remain intact as long as the source and destination machines were functioning, even if some of the machines or transmis- sion lines in between were suddenly put out of operation. Furthermore, since ap- plications with divergent requirements were envisioned, ranging from transferring files toreal-time speechtransmission, aflexible architecture wasneeded. The Link Layer All these requirements led to the choice of a packet-switching network based on a connectionless layer that runs across different networks. The lowest layer in the model, the link layer describes what links such as serial lines and classic Eth- ernet must do to meet the needs of this connectionless internet layer. It is not really a layer at all, in the normal sense of the term, but rather an interface be- tween hosts and transmission links. Early material on the TCP/IP model has little tosayaboutit. The Internet Layer The internet layer is the linchpin that holds the whole architecture together. It is shown in Fig.1-21 as corresponding roughly to the OSI network layer. Its job is to permit hosts to inject packets into any network and have them travel in- dependently to the destination (potentially on a different network)', 'They may even arrive in a completely different order than they were sent, in which case it is the job of higher layers to rearrange them, if in-order delivery is desired. Note that ‘‘internet’’ is used here in a generic sense, even though this layer is present in theInternet.

The analogy here is with the (snail) mail system. A person can drop a se- quence ofinternational letters intoa mailboxinonecountry,andwithalittleluck, SEC. 1.4 REFERENCE MODELS 47 most of them will be delivered to the correct address in the destination country. The letters will probably travel through one or more international mail gateways along the way, but this is transparent to the users. Furthermore, that each country (i.e., each network) has its own stamps, preferred envelope sizes, and delivery rulesishiddenfromtheusers. The internet layer defines an official packet format and protocol called IP (Internet Protocol), plus a companion protocol called ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) that helps it function. The job of the internet layer is to deliver IP packets where they are supposed to go. Packet routing is clearly a major issue here, as is congestion (though IP has not proven effective at avoiding congestion). The Transport Layer The layer above the internet layer in the TCP/IP model is now usually called the transport layer. It is designed to allow peer entities on the source and desti- nation hosts to carry on a conversation, just as in the OSI transport layer. Two end-to-end transport protocols have been defined here. The first one, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), is a reliable connection-oriented protocol that allows a byte stream originating on one machine to be delivered without error on any other machine in the internet. It segments the incoming byte stream into discrete messages and passes each one ontothe internet layer. Atthe destination, the receiving TCP process reassembles the received messages into the output stream. TCP also handles flow control tomake sure afast sender cannotswamp a slowreceiverwithmore messages thanitcan handle. The second protocol in this layer, UDP (User Datagram Protocol), is an unreliable, connectionless protocol for applications that do not want TCP’s sequencing or flow control and wish to provide their own. It is also widely used for one-shot, client-server-type request-reply queries and applications in which prompt delivery is more important than accurate delivery, such as transmitting speech or video. The relation of IP, TCP, and UDP is shown in Fig. 1-22. Since themodelwas developed, IPhasbeen implemented onmanyothernetworks. The Application Layer The TCP/IP model does not have session or presentation layers. No need for them was perceived. Instead, applications simply include any session and pres- entation functions that they require. Experience with the OSI model has proven thisviewcorrect: these layers are oflittleusetomostapplications. Ontopofthe transport layer is the application layer. It contains all the high- er-level protocols. The early ones included virtual terminal (TELNET),file trans- fer (FTP), and electronic mail (SMTP). Many other protocols have been added to these over the years', 'Some important ones that we will study,showninFig.1-22, 48 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Application HTTP SMTP RTP DNS Transport TCP UDP Layers Protocols Internet IP ICMP Link DSL SONET 802.11 Ethernet Figure1-22.

In contrast, the strength of the TCP/IP reference model is the protocols, which have been widely used for many years. Since computer scientists like to have their cake and eat it, too, we willusethehybridmodelofFig. 1-23astheframework forthisbook. 5 Application 4 Transport 3 Network 2 Link 1 Physical Figure1-23. Thereference modelusedinthisbook. This model has five layers, running from the physical layer up through the link, network and transport layers to the application layer. The physical layer specifies how to transmit bits across different kinds of media as electrical (or other analog) signals. The link layer is concerned with how to send finite-length messages between directly connected computers with specified levels of reliabil- ity. Ethernet and802.11are examples oflinklayer protocols. SEC. 1.4 REFERENCE MODELS 49 The network layer deals with how to combine multiple links into networks, andnetworks ofnetworks, intointernetworks sothatwecan sendpackets between distant computers. This includes the task of finding the path along which to send the packets. IP is the main example protocol we will study for this layer. The transport layer strengthens the delivery guarantees of the Network layer, usually with increased reliability, and provide delivery abstractions, such as a reliable byte stream, that match the needs of different applications. TCP is an important example ofatransport layer protocol. Finally, the application layer contains programs that make use of the network. Many, but not all, networked applications have user interfaces, such as a Web browser. Our concern, however, is with the portion of the program that uses the network. This is the HTTP protocol in the case of the Web browser. There are also important support programs in the application layer, such as the DNS, that are usedbymanyapplications. Our chapter sequence is based onthis model. In this way, we retain the value of the OSI model for understanding network architectures, but concentrate pri- marily on protocols that are important in practice, from TCP/IP and related proto- colstonewer onessuchas802.11,SONET, andBluetooth. 1.4.4 A Comparison of the OSI and TCP/IP Reference Models The OSI and TCP/IP reference models have much in common. Both are based on the concept of a stack of independent protocols. Also, the functionality of the layers is roughly similar. For example, in both models the layers up through and including the transport layer are there to provide an end-to-end, net- work-independent transport service to processes wishing to communicate. These layers form the transport provider. Again in both models, the layers above tran- sportare application-oriented users ofthetransport service', 'Despite these fundamental similarities, the two models also have many dif- ferences. Inthissection we willfocus onthekeydifferences between thetworef- erence models. Itisimportant tonote that we are comparing the reference models here, notthe corresponding protocol stacks. The protocols themselves willbedis- cussed later. For an entire book comparing and contrasting TCP/IP and OSI, see Piscitello andChapin(1993). Three concepts are central totheOSImodel: 1. Services. 2. Interfaces. 3. Protocols. Probably the biggest contribution of the OSI model is that it makes the distinction between these three concepts explicit. Each layer performs some services for the 50 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 layer above it. The service definition tells what the layer does, not how entities aboveitaccessitorhowthelayer works. Itdefines thelayer’s semantics. A layer’s interface tells the processes above it how to access it. It specifies what the parameters are and what results to expect. It, too, says nothing about howthelayer worksinside. Finally, the peer protocols used in a layer are the layer’s own business. It can use any protocols it wants to, as long as it gets the job done (i.e., provides the offered services). It can also change them at will without affecting software in higher layers. These ideas fit very nicely with modern ideas about object-oriented pro- gramming. An object, like a layer, has a set of methods (operations) that proc- esses outside the object can invoke. The semantics of these methods define the set of services that the object offers. The methods’ parameters and results form the object’s interface. The code internal to the object is its protocol and is not visible orofanyconcern outside theobject. The TCP/IP model did not originally clearly distinguish between services, in- terfaces, and protocols, although people have tried to retrofit it after the fact to make it more OSI-like. Forexample, the onlyreal services offered bythe internet layer are SEND IP PACKET and RECEIVE IP PACKET. As a consequence, the proto- cols in the OSI model are better hidden than in the TCP/IP model and can be replaced relatively easily as the technology changes. Being able to make such changes transparently is one of the main purposes of having layered protocols in thefirst place. The OSI reference model was devised before the corresponding protocols were invented. This ordering meant that the model was not biased toward one particular set of protocols, a fact that made it quite general. The downside of this ordering was that the designers didnothave much experience withthesubject and didnothave agoodidea ofwhichfunctionalitytoputinwhich layer. For example, the data link layer originally dealt only with point-to-point net- works. When broadcast networks came around, a new sublayer had to be hacked into the model. Furthermore, when people started to build real networks using the OSI model and existing protocols, it was discovered that these networks did not match the required service specifications (wonder of wonders), so convergence sublayers had to be grafted onto the model to provide a place for papering over the differences. Finally, the committee originally expected that each country would have one network, run by the government and using the OSI protocols, so no thought was given to internetworking', 'To make a long story short, things did notturnoutthatway. WithTCP/IP thereverse wastrue: theprotocols came first, andthemodelwas really just a description of the existing protocols. There was no problem with the protocols fitting the model. They fit perfectly. The only trouble was that the model did not fit any other protocol stacks. Consequently, it was not especially usefulfordescribing other, non-TCP/IPnetworks. SEC. 1.4 REFERENCE MODELS 51 Turning from philosophical matters to more specific ones, an obvious dif- ference between the two models is the number of layers: the OSI model has seven layers and the TCP/IP model has four. Both have (inter)network, transport, and application layers, buttheother layers are different. Another difference is in the area of connectionless versus connection-oriented communication. The OSI model supports both connectionless and connection- oriented communication in the network layer, but only connection-oriented com- munication in the transport layer, where it counts (because the transport service is visible to the users). The TCP/IP model supports only one mode in the network layer (connectionless) but both in the transport layer, giving the users a choice. Thischoice isespecially important forsimple request-responseprotocols. 1.4.5 A Critique of the OSI Model and Protocols Neither the OSI model and its protocols nor the TCP/IP model and its proto- cols are perfect. Quite a bit of criticism can be, and has been, directed at both of them. In this section and the next one, we will look at some of these criticisms. We willbeginwithOSIandexamine TCP/IP afterward. At the time the second edition of this book was published (1989), it appeared to many experts in the field that the OSI model and its protocols were going to take over the world and push everything else out of their way. This did not hap- pen. Why? A look back at some ofthe reasons may beuseful. They can be sum- marized as: 1. Badtiming. 2. Badtechnology. 3. Badimplementations. 4. Badpolitics. BadTiming First let us look at reason one: bad timing. The time at which a standard is established isabsolutely criticaltoits success. David Clark ofM.I.T. has atheory of standards that he calls the apocalypse of the two elephants, which is illustrated inFig. 1-24. This figure shows the amount of activity surrounding a new subject. When the subject is first discovered, there is a burst of research activity in the form of discussions, papers, and meetings. After a while this activity subsides, corpora- tionsdiscover thesubject, andthebillion-dollarwave ofinvestment hits. It is essential that the standards be written in the trough in between the two ‘‘elephants.’’ If they are written too early (before the research results are well 52 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Time ytivitcA Billiondollar Research investment Standards Figure1-24. Theapocalypseofthetwoelephants. established), the subject may still be poorly understood; the result is a bad stan- dard. If they are writtentoolate, somany companies may have already made ma- jor investments in different ways of doing things that the standards are effectively ignored. Ifthe interval between the twoelephants isvery short(becauseeveryone isinahurrytogetstarted), thepeople developing thestandards maygetcrushed. It now appears that the standard OSI protocols got crushed', 'The competing TCP/IP protocols were already in widespread use by research universities by the time the OSI protocols appeared. While the billion-dollarwave of investment had not yet hit, the academic market was large enough that many vendors had begun cautiously offering TCP/IP products. When OSI came around, they did not want to support a second protocol stack until they were forced to, so there were no ini- tial offerings. With every company waiting for every other company to go first, nocompany went firstandOSInever happened. BadTechnology The second reason that OSI never caught on is that both the model and the protocols are flawed. The choice of seven layers was more political than techni- cal, and two of the layers (session and presentation) are nearly empty, whereas twoother ones(data linkandnetwork) are overfull. The OSI model, along with its associated service definitions and protocols, is extraordinarily complex. When piled up, the printed standards occupy a signifi- cant fraction of a meter of paper. They are also difficult to implement and ineffi- cient in operation. In this context, a riddle posed by Paul Mockapetris and cited byRose(1993)comes tomind: Q:What doyougetwhenyoucross amobster withaninternational standard? A:Someone whomakes youanofferyoucan’t understand. SEC. 1.4 REFERENCE MODELS 53 In addition to being incomprehensible, another problem with OSI is that some functions, such as addressing, flow control, and error control, reappear again and again ineach layer. Saltzer et al. (1984), for example, have pointed out that to be effective, error control must be done in the highest layer, so that repeating it over andoverineachofthelower layers isoftenunnecessaryandinefficient. BadImplementations Given the enormous complexity of the model and the protocols, it will come as no surprise that the initial implementations were huge, unwieldy, and slow. Everyone who tried them got burned. It did not take long for people to associate ‘‘OSI’’ with ‘‘poor quality.’’ Although the products improved in the course of time, theimage stuck. In contrast, one of the first implementations of TCP/IP was part of Berkeley UNIX and was quite good (not to mention, free). People began using it quickly, which led to a large user community, which led to improvements, which led to an even larger community. Here thespiral wasupward instead ofdownward. BadPolitics On account of the initial implementation, many people, especially in academia, thoughtof TCP/IP as part ofUNIX,andUNIX in the 1980sin academia was notunlikeparenthood(thenincorrectly called motherhood)andapple pie. OSI, onthe other hand, was widely thoughtto be the creature of the European telecommunication ministries, the European Community, and later the U.S. Gov- ernment. This belief was only partly true, but the very idea of a bunch of govern- ment bureaucrats trying to shove a technically inferior standard down the throats of the poor researchers and programmers down in the trenches actually develop- ing computer networks did not aid OSI’s cause. Some people viewed this de- velopment in the same light as IBM announcing in the 1960s that PL/I was the language of the future, or the DoD correcting this later by announcing that it was actually Ada', '1.4.6 A Critique of the TCP/IP Reference Model The TCP/IP model and protocols have their problems too. First, the model does not clearly distinguish the concepts of services, interfaces, and protocols. Good software engineering practice requires differentiating between the specif- ication and the implementation, something that OSI does very carefully, but TCP/IP does not. Consequently, the TCP/IP model is not much of a guide for de- signingnewnetworks usingnewtechnologies. Second, the TCP/IP model is notat all general and is poorly suited to describ- ing any protocol stack other than TCP/IP. Trying to use the TCP/IP model to describe Bluetooth, forexample, iscompletely impossible. 54 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Third, the link layer is not really a layer at all in the normal sense of the term as used inthecontext oflayered protocols. Itisaninterface(between thenetwork and data link layers). The distinction between an interface and a layer is crucial, andoneshouldnotbesloppyaboutit. Fourth, the TCP/IP model does not distinguish between the physical and data link layers. These are completely different. The physical layer has to dowith the transmission characteristics of copper wire, fiber optics, and wireless communica- tion. The data link layer’s job is to delimit the start and end of frames and get them from one side to the other with the desired degree of reliability. A proper modelshouldinclude bothasseparate layers. TheTCP/IP modeldoesnotdothis. Finally, although the IP and TCP protocols were carefully thought out and well implemented, many of the other protocols were ad hoc, generally produced by a couple of graduate students hacking away until they got tired. The protocol implementations were then distributed free, which resulted in their becoming widely used, deeply entrenched, and thus hard to replace. Some of them are a bit of an embarrassment now. The virtual terminal protocol, TELNET, for example, was designed for a ten-character-per-second mechanical Teletype terminal. It knows nothing of graphical user interfaces and mice. Nevertheless, it is still in usesome30years later. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS The subject of computer networking covers many different kinds of networks, large and small, well known and less well known. They have different goals, scales, and technologies. In the following sections, we will look at some ex- amples, togetanidea ofthevariety onefindsinthearea ofcomputer networking. We will start with the Internet, probably the best known network, and look at its history, evolution, and technology. Then we will consider the mobile phone network. Technically, it is quite different from the Internet, contrasting nicely with it. Next we will introduce IEEE 802.11, the dominant standard for wireless LANs. Finally, we will look at RFID and sensor networks, technologies that ex- tendthereachofthenetwork toinclude thephysicalworldandeveryday objects. 1.5.1 The Internet The Internet is not really a network at all, but a vast collection of different networks that use certain common protocols and provide certain common ser- vices. It isan unusualsystem in that it was notplanned byanyone and is not con- trolled by anyone. To better understand it, let us start from the beginning and see how it has developed and why. For a wonderful history of the Internet, John Naughton’s(2000)bookishighly recommended. Itisoneofthoserare booksthat isnotonlyfuntoread, butalsohas20pages ofibid.’sandop.cit.’sforthe serious historian', 'Some ofthematerial inthissection isbased onthisbook. SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 55 Of course, countless technical books have been written about the Internet and itsprotocols aswell. Formore information, see, forexample, Maufer (1999). The ARPANET The story begins in the late 1950s. At the height of the Cold War, the U.S. DoD wanted a command-and-control network that could survive a nuclear war. At that time, all military communications used the public telephone network, which was considered vulnerable. The reason for this belief can be gleaned from Fig.1-25(a). Here the black dots represent telephone switching offices, each of which was connected to thousands of telephones. These switching offices were, in turn, connected to higher-level switching offices (toll offices), to form a national hierarchy with only a small amount of redundancy. The vulnerability of the system was that the destruction of a few key toll offices could fragment it into manyisolated islands. Switching office Toll office (a) (b) Figure1-25. (a) Structure of the telephone system. (b) Baran’s proposed dis- tributedswitchingsystem. Around1960,the DoDawarded a contract to the RAND Corporation tofind a solution. One of its employees, Paul Baran, came up with the highly distributed andfault-tolerant design ofFig.1-25(b). Since the paths between anytwoswitch- ing offices were now much longer than analog signals could travel without distor- tion, Baran proposedusing digital packet-switching technology. Baran wrote sev- eral reports for the DoD describing his ideas in detail (Baran, 1964). Officials at the Pentagon liked the concept and asked AT&T, then the U.S.’ national tele- phone monopoly, to build a prototype. AT&T dismissed Baran’s ideas out of hand. The biggest and richest corporation in the world was not about to allow 56 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 some young whippersnapper tell it how to build a telephone system. They said Baran’s network couldnotbebuiltandtheidea waskilled. Several years went by and still the DoD did not have a better command-and- control system. To understand what happened next, we have to go back all the way to October 1957, when the Soviet Union beat the U.S. into space with the launch of the first artificial satellite,Sputnik. When President Eisenhowertried to find out who was asleep at the switch, he was appalled to find the Army, Navy, and Air Force squabbling over the Pentagon’s research budget. His immediate response was to create a single defense research organization, ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency. ARPA had no scientists or laboratories; in fact, it had nothing more than an office and a small (by Pentagon standards) budget. It did its work by issuing grants and contracts to universities and com- panies whose ideas lookedpromising toit. For the first few years, ARPA tried to figure out what its mission should be. In 1967, the attention of Larry Roberts, a program manager at ARPA who was trying to figure out how to provide remote access to computers, turned to net- working. He contacted various experts to decide what to do. One of them, Wes- ley Clark, suggested building a packet-switched subnet, connecting each host to itsownrouter', 'After some initial skepticism, Roberts bought the idea and presented a some- what vague paper about it at the ACM SIGOPS Symposium on Operating System Principles held in Gatlinburg, Tennessee in late 1967 (Roberts, 1967). Much to Roberts’ surprise, another paper at the conference described a similar system that had not only been designed but actually fully implemented under the direction of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory in England. The NPL system was not a national system (it just connected several computers on the NPL campus), but it demonstrated that packet switching could be made to work. Fur- thermore, it cited Baran’s now discarded earlier work. Roberts came away from Gatlinburgdetermined tobuildwhatlater becameknownastheARPANET. The subnet would consist of minicomputers called IMPs (Interface Message Processors) connected by 56-kbps transmission lines. For high reliability, each IMP would be connected to at least two other IMPs. The subnet was to be a datagram subnet, so if some lines and IMPs were destroyed, messages could be automatically rerouted alongalternative paths. Each node of the network was to consist of an IMP and a host, in the same room, connected by a short wire. A host could send messages of up to 8063 bits to its IMP, which would then break these up into packets of at most 1008 bits and forward them independently toward the destination. Each packet was received in its entirety before being forwarded, so the subnet was the first electronic store- and-forward packet-switching network. ARPA then put out a tender for building the subnet. Twelve companies bid for it. After evaluating all the proposals, ARPA selected BBN, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in December 1968 awarded it a contract SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 57 to build the subnet and write the subnet software. BBN chose to use specially modified Honeywell DDP-316 minicomputers with 12K 16-bit words of core memory as the IMPs. The IMPs did not have disks, since moving parts were con- sidered unreliable. The IMPs were interconnected by 56-kbps lines leased from telephone companies. Although 56 kbps is now the choice of teenagers who can- notafford DSL orcable, itwasthenthebestmoneycouldbuy. The software was split into two parts: subnet and host. The subnet software consisted of the IMP end of the host-IMP connection, the IMP-IMP protocol, and a source IMP to destination IMP protocol designed to improve reliability. The original ARPANET designisshowninFig. 1-26. Host-hostprotocol Host Host-IMP protocol SourceIMPtodestinationIMPprotocol IMP-IMPprotocol IM pr P ot -I o M co P l Subnet IMP Figure1-26. TheoriginalARPANETdesign. Outside the subnet, software was also needed, namely, the host end of the host-IMP connection, the host-host protocol, and the application software. Itsoon becameclear thatBBN wasoftheopinionthatwhenithadaccepteda message on a host-IMP wire and placed it on the host-IMP wire at the destination, its job was done. Roberts had a problem, though: the hosts needed software too. To deal with it, he convened a meeting of network researchers, mostly graduate students, at Snowbird, Utah, in the summer of 1969', 'The graduate students expected some network expert toexplain thegranddesignofthenetwork anditssoftware tothem and then assign each of them the job of writing part of it. They were astounded when there was no network expert and no grand design. They had to figure out whattodoontheir own. Nevertheless, somehow an experimental network went online in December 1969 with four nodes: at UCLA, UCSB, SRI, and the University of Utah. These four were chosen because all had a large number of ARPA contracts, and all had different and completely incompatible host computers (just to make it more fun). The first host-to-host message had been sent two months earlier from the UCLA 58 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 nodebyateam led byLen Kleinrock (a pioneer ofthe theory ofpacket switching) to the SRI node. The network grew quickly as more IMPs were delivered and installed; it soon spanned the United States. Figure 1-27 shows how rapidly the ARPANET grew inthefirst3years.

GrowthoftheARPANET.(a)December1969.(b)July1970. (c)March1971.(d)April1972.(e)September1972. In addition to helping the fledgling ARPANET grow, ARPA also funded re- search on the use of satellite networks and mobile packet radio networks. In one now famous demonstration, a truck driving around in California used the packet radio network to send messages to SRI, which were then forwarded over the ARPANET to the East Coast, where they were shipped to University College in London over the satellite network. This allowed a researcher in the truck to use a computer inLondonwhile drivingaroundinCalifornia. This experiment also demonstrated that the existing ARPANET protocols were not suitable for running over different networks. This observation led to more research on protocols, culminating with the invention of the TCP/IP model and protocols (Cerf and Kahn, 1974). TCP/IP was specifically designed tohandle communication over internetworks, something becoming increasingly important asmoreandmore networks were hookeduptotheARPANET. SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 59 To encourage adoption of these new protocols, ARPA awarded several con- tracts to implement TCP/IP on different computer platforms, including IBM, DEC, and HP systems, as well as for Berkeley UNIX. Researchers at the Univer- sity of California at Berkeley rewrote TCP/IP with a new programming interface called sockets for the upcoming 4.2BSD release of Berkeley UNIX. They also wrote many application, utility, and management programs to show how con- venient itwas tousethenetwork withsockets. The timing was perfect. Many universities had just acquired a second or third VAXcomputer and aLAN toconnectthem, butthey hadnonetworking software. When 4.2BSD came along, with TCP/IP, sockets, and many network utilities, the complete package was adopted immediately. Furthermore, with TCP/IP, it was easy fortheLANs toconnecttotheARPANET, andmanydid', 'During the 1980s, additional networks, especially LANs, were connected to the ARPANET. As the scale increased, finding hosts became increasingly expen- sive, so DNS (Domain Name System) was created to organize machines into do- mains and map host names onto IP addresses. Since then, DNS has become a generalized, distributed database system for storing a variety of information relat- edtonaming. We willstudyitindetail inChap. 7. NSFNET By the late 1970s, NSF (the U.S. National Science Foundation) saw the enor- mous impact the ARPANET was having on university research, allowing scien- tists across the country to share data and collaborate on research projects. How- ever, to get on the ARPANET a university had to have a research contract with the DoD. Many did not have a contract. NSF’s initial response was to fund the Computer Science Network (CSNET) in 1981. It connected computer science de- partments and industrial research labs to the ARPANET via dial-up and leased lines. Inthe late 1980s,theNSF went further anddecided todesignasuccessorto theARPANET thatwouldbeopentoalluniversity research groups. To have something concrete to start with, NSF decided to build a backbone network to connect its six supercomputer centers, in San Diego, Boulder, Cham- paign, Pittsburgh, Ithaca, and Princeton. Each supercomputer was given a little brother, consisting of an LSI-11 microcomputer called a fuzzball. The fuzzballs were connected with 56-kbps leased lines and formed the subnet, the same hard- ware technology the ARPANET used. The software technology was different however: the fuzzballs spoke TCP/IP right from the start, making it the first TCP/IP WAN. NSF alsofundedsome (eventually about20)regional networks that connected tothebackbonetoallow usersatthousandsofuniversities,research labs, libraries, and museums to access any of the supercomputers and to communicate with one another. The complete network, including backbone and the regional networks, was called NSFNET. It connected to the ARPANET through a link between an 60 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 IMP and a fuzzball in the Carnegie-Mellon machine room. The first NSFNET backboneisillustratedinFig. 1-28superimposed onamapoftheU.S. NSFSupercomputercenter NSFMidlevelnetwork Both Figure1-28. TheNSFNETbackbonein1988. NSFNET wasaninstantaneous successandwas overloaded from the wordgo. NSF immediately began planning its successor and awarded a contract to the Michigan-based MERIT consortium to run it. Fiber optic channels at 448 kbps were leased from MCI (since merged with WorldCom) to provide the version 2 backbone. IBM PC-RTs were used as routers. This, too, was soon overwhelmed, andby1990,thesecondbackbonewas upgradedto1.5Mbps. As growth continued, NSF realized that the government could not continue financing networking forever. Furthermore, commercial organizations wanted to join but were forbidden by NSF’s charter from using networks NSF paid for. Consequently, NSF encouraged MERIT, MCI, and IBM to form a nonprofit cor- poration, ANS (Advanced Networks and Services), as the first step along the road to commercialization. In 1990, ANS took over NSFNET and upgraded the 1.5-Mbps links to 45 Mbps to form ANSNET. This network operated for 5 years andwas then soldtoAmerica Online. But bythen, various companies were offer- ing commercial IP service and it was clear the government should now get out of thenetworking business', 'To ease the transition and make sure every regional network could communi- cate with every other regional network, NSF awarded contracts to four different network operators to establish a NAP (Network Access Point). These operators were PacBell (San Francisco), Ameritech (Chicago), MFS (Washington, D.C.), and Sprint (New York City, where for NAP purposes, Pennsauken, New Jersey counts as New York City). Every network operator that wanted to provide back- boneservice totheNSF regional networks hadtoconnecttoalltheNAPs. SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 61 Thisarrangement meant that apacket originating onanyregional network had a choice of backbone carriers to get from its NAP to the destination’s NAP. Con- sequently, the backbone carriers were forced to compete for the regional net- works’ business on the basis of service and price, which was the idea, of course. As a result, the concept of a single default backbone was replaced by a commer- cially driven competitive infrastructure. Many people like to criticize the Federal Government for not being innovative, but in the area of networking, it was DoD and NSF that created the infrastructure that formed the basis for the Internet and thenhanded itovertoindustrytooperate. During the 1990s, many other countries and regions also built national re- search networks, often patterned on the ARPANET and NSFNET. These in- cluded EuropaNET and EBONE in Europe, which started out with 2-Mbps lines and then upgraded to 34-Mbps lines. Eventually, the network infrastructure in Europe washanded overtoindustryaswell. The Internet has changed a great deal since those early days. It exploded in size with the emergence of the World Wide Web (WWW) in the early 1990s. Recent data from the Internet Systems Consortium puts the number of visible In- ternet hosts at over 600 million. This guess is only a low-ball estimate, but it far exceeds the few million hosts that were around when the first conference on the WWWwasheldatCERN in1994. The wayweusetheInternet has also changed radically. Initially,applications such as email-for-academics, newsgroups, remote login, and file transfer dom- inated. Later it switched to email-for-everyman, then the Web and peer-to-peer content distribution, such asthenow-shuttered Napster. Nowreal-time media dis- tribution, social networks (e.g., Facebook), and microblogging (e.g., Twitter) are taking off. These switches broughtricher kindsofmedia totheInternet andhence much more traffic. In fact, the dominant traffic on the Internet seems to change with some regularity as, for example, new and better ways to work with music or movies can become verypopularveryquickly. Architecture ofthe Internet The architecture of the Internet has also changed a great deal as it has grown explosively. In this section, we will attempt to give a brief overview of what it looks like today. The picture is complicated by continuous upheavals in the businesses of telephone companies (telcos), cable companies and ISPs that often make it hard to tell who is doing what. One driver of these upheavals is telecom- munications convergence, in which one network is used for previously different uses. For example, in a ‘‘triple play’’ one company sells you telephony, TV, and Internet service over the same network connectiononthe assumption that thiswill save you money', 'Consequently, the description given here will be of necessity somewhat simpler thanreality. Andwhat istruetodaymaynotbetrue tomorrow. 62 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 The big picture is shown in Fig. 1-29. Let us examine this figure piece by piece, starting with a computer at home (at the edges of the figure). To join the Internet, the computer is connected to an Internet Service Provider, or simply ISP, from who the user purchases Internet access or connectivity. This lets the computer exchange packets with all of the other accessible hosts on the Internet. The user might send packets tosurfthe Web orforanyofathousandother uses,it does not matter. There are many kinds of Internet access, and they are usually distinguished by how much bandwidth they provide and how much they cost, but themostimportant attribute isconnectivity.

A common way to connect to an ISP is to use the phone line to your house, in which case your phone company is your ISP. DSL, short for Digital Subscriber Line, reuses the telephone line that connects to your house for digital data transmission. The computer is connected to a device called a DSL modem that converts between digital packets and analog signals that can pass unhindered over the telephone line. At the other end, a device called a DSLAM (Digital Sub- scriber Line AccessMultiplexer)convertsbetween signals andpackets. Several other popular ways to connect toan ISP are shown in Fig. 1-29. DSL is a higher-bandwidth way to use the local telephone line than to send bits over a traditional telephone call instead of a voice conversation. That is called dial-up and done with a different kind of modem at both ends. The word modem is short for ‘‘modulator demodulator’’ and refers to any device that converts between digi- talbitsandanalog signals. Another method is to send signals over the cable TV system. Like DSL, this is a way to reuse existing infrastructure, in this case otherwise unused cable TV SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 63 channels. The device at the home end is called a cable modem and the device at thecable headend iscalled theCMTS (Cable Modem Termination System). DSL and cable provide Internet access at rates from a small fraction of a megabit/sec to multiple megabit/sec, depending on the system. These rates are much greater than dial-up rates, which are limited to 56 kbps because of the nar- row bandwidth used for voice calls. Internet access at much greater than dial-up speeds is called broadband. The name refers to the broader bandwidth that is usedforfaster networks, rather thananyparticular speed. The access methods mentioned so far are limited by the bandwidth of the ‘‘last mile’’orlast legoftransmission. Byrunningoptical fiber toresidences, fast- er Internet access can be provided at rates on the order of 10 to 100 Mbps. This design is called FTTH (Fiber to the Home). For businesses in commercial areas, it may make sense to lease a high-speed transmission line from the offices to the nearest ISP', 'For example, in North America, a T3 line runs at roughly 45 Mbps. Wireless isusedforInternet accesstoo.Anexample wewillexplore shortly is that of 3G mobile phone networks. They can provide data delivery at rates of 1 Mbpsorhigher tomobile phonesandfixed subscribers inthecoverage area. We can now move packets between the home and the ISP. We call the loca- tion at which customer packets enter the ISP network for service the ISP’s POP (Point of Presence). We will next explain how packets are moved between the POPs of different ISPs. From this point on, the system is fully digital and packet switched. ISP networks may be regional, national, or international in scope. We have already seen that their architecture is made up of long-distance transmission lines that interconnect routers at POPs in the different cities that the ISPs serve. This equipment is called the backbone of the ISP. If a packet is destined for a host served directly by the ISP, that packet is routed over the backbone and delivered tothehost. Otherwise, itmustbehanded overtoanother ISP. ISPs connect their networks to exchange traffic at IXPs (Internet eXchange Points). The connected ISPs are said to peer with each other. There are many IXPs in cities around the world. They are drawn vertically in Fig. 1-29 because ISP networks overlap geographically. Basically, an IXP is a room full of routers, at least one per ISP. A LAN in the room connects all the routers, so packets can be forwarded from any ISP backbone to any other ISP backbone. IXPs can be large and independently owned facilities. One of the largest is the Amsterdam In- ternet Exchange, to which hundreds of ISPs connect and through which they exchange hundredsofgigabits/sec oftraffic. The peering that happens at IXPs depends on the business relationships be- tween ISPs. There are many possible relationships. For example, a small ISP might pay a larger ISP for Internet connectivity to reach distant hosts, much as a customer purchases service from an Internet provider. In this case, the small ISP is said to pay for transit. Alternatively, two large ISPs might decide to exchange 64 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 traffic so that each ISP can deliver some traffic to the other ISP without having to pay for transit. One of the many paradoxes of the Internet is that ISPs who pub- licly compete withone another forcustomers often privately cooperatetodopeer- ing(Metz, 2001). The pathapacket takes throughtheInternet depends onthepeering choices of the ISPs. If the ISP delivering a packet peers with the destination ISP, it might deliver the packet directly to its peer. Otherwise, it might route the packet to the nearest place at which it connects to a paid transit provider so that provider can deliver the packet. Two example paths across ISPs are drawn in Fig.1-29. Often, thepathapacket takes willnotbetheshortest paththroughtheInternet. Atthe topofthe foodchain are a small handful of companies, like AT&T and Sprint, that operate large international backbone networks with thousands of rout- ers connected by high-bandwidth fiber optic links. These ISPs do not pay for transit', 'They are usually called tier 1 ISPs and are said to form the backbone of the Internet, since everyone else must connect to them to be able to reach the en- tire Internet. Companies that provide lots of content, such as Google and Yahoo!, locate their computers in data centers that are well connected to the rest of the Internet. These data centers are designed for computers, not humans, and may be filled with rack upon rack of machines called a server farm. Colocation or hosting data centers let customers put equipment such as servers at ISP POPs so that short, fast connections can be made between the servers and the ISP backbones. The Internet hosting industry has become increasingly virtualized so that it is now common to rent a virtual machine that is run ona server farm instead of installing a physical computer. These data centers are so large (tens or hundreds of thousands of machines) that electricity is a major cost, so data centers are some- times builtinareas where electricity ischeap. This ends our quick tour of the Internet. We will have a great deal to say about the individual components and their design, algorithms, and protocols in subsequent chapters. One further point worth mentioning here is that what it means to be on the Internet is changing. It used to be that a machine was on the Internet if it: (1) ran the TCP/IP protocol stack; (2) had an IP address; and (3) could send IP packets to all the other machines on the Internet. However, ISPs often reuse IP addresses depending on which computers are in use at the moment, and home networks often share one IP address between multiple computers. This practice undermines the second condition. Security measures such as firewalls can also partly block computers from receiving packets, undermining the third condition. Despite these difficulties, it makes sense to regard such machines as beingontheInternet while theyare connectedtotheir ISPs. Alsoworthmentioning inpassing isthat some companies have interconnected all their existing internal networks, often using the same technology as the Inter- net. These intranets are typically accessible only on company premises or from company notebooksbutotherwise workthesame wayastheInternet. SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 65 1.5.2 Third-Generation Mobile Phone Networks People love to talk on the phone even more than they like to surf the Internet, and this has made the mobile phone network the most successful network in the world. Ithasmore than fourbillionsubscribers worldwide. Toputthisnumber in perspective, itisroughly60%oftheworld’s populationandmore thanthenumber ofInternet hostsandfixed telephonelines combined (ITU, 2009). The architecture of the mobile phone network has changed greatly over the past 40 years along with its tremendous growth. First-generation mobile phone systems transmitted voice calls as continuously varying (analog) signals rather than sequences of (digital) bits. AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System), which was deployed in the United States in 1982, was a widely used first- generation system. Second-generation mobile phone systems switched to trans- mittingvoice calls indigital form toincrease capacity, improve security, and offer text messaging', 'GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), which was deployed starting in 1991 and has become the most widely used mobile phone system intheworld, isa2Gsystem. The third generation, or3G, systems were initiallydeployed in 2001and offer both digital voice and broadband digital data services. They also come with a lot of jargon and many different standards to choose from. 3G is loosely defined by the ITU (an international standards body we will discuss in the next section) as providing rates of at least 2 Mbps for stationary or walking users and 384 kbps in a moving vehicle. UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), also called WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access), is the main 3G system that is being rapidly deployed worldwide. It can provide up to 14 Mbps on the downlink and almost 6 Mbps on the uplink. Future releases will use multipleantennas andradiostoprovideeven greater speeds forusers. The scarce resource in 3G systems, as in 2G and 1G systems before them, is radio spectrum. Governments license the right to use parts of the spectrum to the mobile phonenetwork operators, often usingaspectrum auction inwhich network operators submit bids. Having a piece of licensed spectrum makes it easier to de- sign and operate systems, since no one else is allowed transmit on that spectrum, but it often costs a serious amount of money. Inthe UKin2000,forexample, five 3Glicenses were auctioned foratotal ofabout$40billion. It is the scarcity of spectrum that led to the cellular network design shown in Fig.1-30 that is now used for mobile phone networks. To manage the radio interference between users, the coverage area is divided into cells. Within a cell, users are assigned channels that do not interfere with each other and do not cause too much interference for adjacent cells. This allows for good reuse of the spec- trum, or frequency reuse, in the neighboring cells, which increases the capacity of the network. In 1G systems, which carried each voice call on a specific fre- quency band, the frequencies were carefully chosen so that they did not conflict with neighboring cells. In this way, a given frequency might only be reused once 66 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 in several cells. Modern 3G systems allow each cell to use all frequencies, but in a way that results in a tolerable level of interference to the neighboring cells. There are variations on the cellular design, including the use of directional or sec- tored antennas on cell towers to further reduce interference, but the basic idea is thesame. Cells Basestation Figure1-30. Cellulardesignofmobilephonenetworks. The architecture ofthe mobile phonenetwork is very different than that of the Internet. It has several parts, as shown in the simplified version of the UMTS ar- chitecture inFig. 1-31. First, there istheairinterface. Thisterm isafancy name for the radio communication protocol that is used over the air between the mobile device (e.g., the cell phone)and the cellular base station. Advances inthe air in- terface over the past decades have greatly increased wireless data rates. The UMTS airinterfaceisbased onCode Division Multiple Access(CDMA),atech- niquethatwewillstudyinChap. 2', 'The cellular base station together with its controller forms the radio access network. This part is the wireless side of the mobile phone network. The con- troller node or RNC (Radio Network Controller) controls how the spectrum is used. The base station implements the air interface. It is called Node B, a tem- porarylabel thatstuck. The rest of the mobile phone network carries the traffic for the radio access network. It is called the core network. The UMTS core network evolved from the core network used for the 2G GSM system that came before it. However, something surprisingishappening intheUMTScore network. Since the beginning of networking, a war has been going on between the peo- ple whosupportpacket networks (i.e., connectionlesssubnets)andthepeople who support circuit networks (i.e., connection-oriented subnets). The main proponents of packets come from the Internet community. In a connectionless design, every packet is routed independently of every other packet. As a consequence, if some routers go down during a session, no harm will be done as long as the system can SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 67 Air Access interface NodeB /Core (“Uu”) interface (“Iu”) RNC Circuits MSC/ GMSC PSTN MGW /MGW (“Iu-CS”) RNC HSS Packets SGSN GGSN Internet (“Iu-PS”) Packets Radioaccessnetwork Corenetwork Figure1-31. Architecture oftheUMTS3Gmobilephonenetwork. dynamically reconfigure itself so that subsequent packets can find some route to thedestination, even ifitisdifferent fromthatwhich previouspackets used. The circuit camp comes from the world of telephone companies. In the tele- phone system, a caller must dial the called party’s number and wait for a connec- tion before talking or sending data. This connection setup establishes a route through the telephone system that is maintained until the call is terminated. All wordsorpackets followthesame route. Ifalineorswitch onthe path goes down, thecall isaborted, makingitlessfault tolerant thanaconnectionlessdesign. The advantage ofcircuits isthat they can supportqualityofservice more easi- ly. By setting up a connection in advance, the subnet can reserve resources such as link bandwidth, switch buffer space, and CPU. If an attempt is made to set up a call and insufficient resources are available, the call is rejected and the caller gets a kind of busy signal. In this way, once a connection has been set up, the connectionwillgetgoodservice. With a connectionless network, if too many packets arrive at the same router at the same moment, the router will choke and probably lose packets. The sender willeventually notice this andresend them, butthe qualityofservice willbejerky andunsuitable foraudioorvideounlessthenetwork islightly loaded. Needless to say, providing adequate audio quality is something telephone companies care aboutverymuch, hence their preference forconnections. The surprise in Fig. 1-31 is that there is both packet and circuit switched equipment in the core network. This shows the mobile phone network in transi- tion, with mobile phone companies able to implement one or sometimes both of 68 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 the alternatives. Older mobile phone networks used a circuit-switched core in the style of the traditional phone network to carry voice calls', 'This legacy is seen in the UMTS network with the MSC (Mobile Switching Center), GMSC (Gate- way Mobile Switching Center), and MGW (Media Gateway) elements that set up connections over a circuit-switched core network such as the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). Data services have become a much more important part of the mobile phone network than they used to be, starting with text messaging and early packet data services such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) in the GSM system. These older data services ran at tens of kbps, but users wanted more. Newer mo- bile phone networks carry packet data at rates of multiple Mbps. For comparison, avoice call iscarried atarate of64kbps,typically 3–4xlesswithcompression. To carry all this data, the UMTS core network nodes connect directly to a packet-switched network. The SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) and the GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) deliver data packets to and from mobiles andinterfacetoexternal packet networks suchastheInternet. This transition is set to continue in the mobile phone networks that are now beingplanned anddeployed. Internet protocols are even usedonmobiles tosetup connections for voice calls over a packet data network, in the manner of voice- over-IP. IP and packets are used all the way from the radio access through to the core network. Of course, the way that IP networks are designed is also changing to support better quality of service. If it did not, then problems with chopped-up audio andjerky video wouldnotimpress paying customers. We will return tothis subject inChap. 5. Another difference between mobile phone networks and the traditional Inter- net is mobility. When a user moves out of the range of one cellular base station and into the range of another one, the flow of data must be re-routed from the old to the new cell base station. This technique is known as handover or handoff, anditisillustratedinFig. 1-32. (a) (b) Figure1-32. Mobilephonehandover(a)before,(b)after. Either the mobile device or the base station may request a handover when the quality of the signal drops. In some cell networks, usually those based onCDMA SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 69 technology, it is possible to connect to the new base station before disconnecting fromthe oldbase station. This improves the connectionqualityforthemobile be- cause there is no break in service; the mobile is actually connected to two base stations for a short while. This way of doing a handover is called a soft handover to distinguish it from a hard handover, in which the mobile disconnects from the oldbase station before connectingtothenewone. A related issue is how to find a mobile in the first place when there is an in- coming call. Each mobile phone network has a HSS (Home Subscriber Server) in the core network that knows the location of each subscriber, as well as other profile information that is used for authentication and authorization. In this way, eachmobilecan befoundbycontacting theHSS. A final area to discuss is security. Historically, phone companies have taken security much more seriously than Internet companies for a long time because of the need to bill for service and avoid (payment) fraud', 'Unfortunately that is not saying much. Nevertheless, in the evolution from 1G through 3G technologies, mobile phone companies have been able to roll out some basic security mechan- ismsformobiles. Starting with the 2G GSM system, the mobile phone was divided into a handset and a removable chip containing the subscriber’s identity and account information. The chip is informally called a SIM card, short for Subscriber Identity Module. SIM cards can be switched to different handsets to activate them, and they provide a basis for security. When GSM customers travel to other countries on vacation or business, they often bring their handsets but buy a new SIMcard forfew dollars uponarrival inorder tomake local calls withnoroaming charges. To reduce fraud, information on SIM cards is also used by the mobile phone network toauthenticate subscribers andcheck that they are allowed tousethenet- work. With UMTS, the mobile also uses the information on the SIM card to check thatitistalking toalegitimatenetwork. Another aspect of security is privacy. Wireless signals are broadcast to all nearby receivers, so to make it difficult to eavesdrop on conversations, crypto- graphic keys on the SIM card are used to encrypt transmissions. This approach provides much better privacy than in1Gsystems, which were easily tapped, butis notapanaceaduetoweaknesses intheencryption schemes. Mobile phone networks are destined to play a central role in future networks. They are nowmore aboutmobile broadband applications than voice calls, andthis has major implications for the air interfaces, core network architecture, and secu- rity offuture networks. 4Gtechnologiesthatare faster andbetter are onthedraw- ing board under the name of LTE (Long Term Evolution), even as 3G design and deployment continues. Other wireless technologies also offer broadband In- ternet access to fixed and mobile clients, notably 802.16 networks under the com- mon name of WiMAX. It is entirely possible that LTEandWiMAX are onacol- lisioncourse witheachother anditishardtopredict what willhappen tothem. 70 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 1.5.3 Wireless LANs: 802.11 Almost as soon as laptop computers appeared, many people had a dream of walking intoanoffice andmagically havingtheir laptopcomputer beconnectedto the Internet. Consequently, various groups began working on ways to accomplish this goal. The most practical approach is to equip both the office and the laptop computers withshort-range radiotransmittersandreceiverstoallow themtotalk. Workinthisfield rapidly ledtowireless LANs being marketed byavariety of companies. The trouble was that notwo of them were compatible. The prolifera- tion of standards meant that a computer equipped with a brand X radio would not work inaroomequipped with abrand Ybase station. Inthemid1990s,theindus- try decided that a wireless LAN standard might be a good idea, so the IEEE com- mitteethat had standardized wired LANswas giventhetaskofdrawing upawire- lessLAN standard. The firstdecision wastheeasiest: whattocall it. Allthe other LAN standards hadnumbers like 802.1,802.2,and802.3,upto802.10,sothe wireless LAN stan- dard was dubbed 802.11. A common slang name for it is WiFi but it is an impor- tantstandard anddeserves respect, sowewillcall itbyitspropername, 802.11. The rest was harder. The first problem was to find a suitable frequency band that was available, preferably worldwide. The approach taken was the opposite of that used in mobile phone networks', 'Instead of expensive, licensed spectrum, 802.11 systems operate in unlicensed bands such as the ISM (Industrial, Scien- tific, and Medical) bands defined by ITU-R (e.g., 902-928MHz, 2.4-2.5GHz, 5.725-5.825GHz). All devices are allowed to use this spectrum provided that they limit their transmit power to let different devices coexist. Of course, this means that 802.11 radios may find themselves competing with cordless phones, garage dooropeners, andmicrowave ovens. 802.11 networks are made up of clients, such as laptops and mobile phones, andinfrastructure called APs (accesspoints)thatisinstalled inbuildings. Access pointsare sometimes called base stations. The access pointsconnecttothe wired network, and all communication between clients goes through an access point. It isalsopossible forclients that are inradio range totalk directly, such as twocom- puters in an office without an access point. This arrangement is called an ad hoc network. It is used much less often than the access point mode. Both modes are showninFig.1-33. 802.11 transmission is complicated bywireless conditions that vary with even small changes in the environment. At the frequencies used for 802.11, radio sig- nals can be reflected off solid objects so that multiple echoes of a transmission may reach a receiver along different paths. The echoes can cancel or reinforce each other, causing the received signal to fluctuate greatly. This phenomenon is called multipath fading,anditisshowninFig.1-34. The key idea for overcoming variable wireless conditions is path diversity, or the sending of information along multiple, independent paths. In this way, the SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 71 Access Towirednetwork point (a) (b) Figure1-33. (a)Wirelessnetworkwithanaccesspoint.(b)Adhocnetwork. information is likely to be received even if one of the paths happens to be poor due to a fade. These independent paths are typically built into the digital modula- tion scheme at the physical layer. Options include using different frequencies a- cross the allowed band, following different spatial paths between different pairsof antennas, orrepeating bitsoverdifferent periodsoftime. Multiplepaths Non-fadedsignal Wireless transmitter Reflector Fadedsignal Wireless receiver Figure1-34. Multipathfading. Different versions of 802.11 have used all of these techniques. The initial (1997) standard defined a wireless LAN that ran at either 1 Mbps or 2 Mbps by hopping between frequencies or spreading the signal across the allowed spectrum. Almost immediately, people complained that it was too slow, so work began on faster standards. The spread spectrum design was extended and became the (1999) 802.11b standard running at rates up to 11 Mbps. The 802.11a (1999) and 802.11g (2003) standards switched to a different modulation scheme called OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). It divides a wide band of spectrum into many narrow slices over which different bits are sent in parallel. This improved scheme, which we will study in Chap. 2, boosted the 802.11a/g bit 72 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 rates up to 54Mbps. That is a significant increase, but people still wanted more throughputtosupportmore demanding uses. The latest versionis802.11n(2009). It uses wider frequency bands and up to four antennas per computer to achieve rates upto450Mbps', \"Since wireless is inherently a broadcast medium, 802.11 radios also have to deal with the problem that multiple transmissions that are sent at the same time will collide, which may interfere with reception. To handle this problem, 802.11 uses a CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)scheme that draws onideas from classic wired Ethernet, which, ironically, drew from an early wireless network developed in Hawaii and called ALOHA. Computers wait for a short random interval before transmitting, and defer their transmissions if they hear that some- one else is already transmitting. This scheme makes it less likely that two com- puters willsend at the same time. It does notwork as well as in the case of wired networks, though. To see why, examine Fig.1-35. Suppose that computer A is transmitting to computer B, but the radio range of A’s transmitter is too short to reach computer C. If C wants to transmit to B it can listen before starting, but the fact that it does not hear anything does not mean that its transmission will succeed. The inability of C tohear Abefore starting causes some collisionstooc- cur. After any collision, the sender then waits another, longer, random delay and retransmits the packet. Despite thisand some other issues, the scheme workswell enoughinpractice. Range Range ofA's ofC's radio radio A B C Figure1-35. Therangeofasingleradiomaynotcovertheentiresystem. Another problem is that of mobility. If a mobile client is moved away from theaccesspointitisusingandintotherange ofadifferent accesspoint,someway of handing it off is needed. The solution is that an 802.11 network can consist of multiple cells, each with its own access point, and a distribution system that con- nects the cells. The distribution system is often switched Ethernet, but it can use any technology. As the clients move, they may find another access point with a better signal than the one they are currently using and change their association. Fromtheoutside, theentire system lookslikeasingle wired LAN. SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 73 That said, mobility in 802.11 has been of limited value so far compared to mobility in the mobile phone network. Typically, 802.11 is used by nomadic cli- ents that go from one fixed location to another, rather than being used on-the-go. Mobility is not really needed for nomadic usage. Even when 802.11 mobility is used, it extends over a single 802.11 network, which might cover at most a large building. Future schemes will need to provide mobility across different networks andacross different technologies(e.g., 802.21). Finally, there is the problem of security. Since wireless transmissions are broadcast, it is easy for nearby computers to receive packets of information that were not intended for them. To prevent this, the 802.11 standard included an en- cryption scheme known as WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). The idea was to make wireless security like that of wired security. It is a good idea, but unfor- tunately the scheme was flawed and soon broken (Borisov et al., 2001). It has since been replaced with newer schemes that have different cryptographic details in the 802.11i standard, also called WiFi Protected Access, initially called WPA butnowreplacedbyWPA2\", '802.11 has caused a revolution in wireless networking that is set to continue. Beyondbuildings, it is starting to be installed in trains, planes, boats, and automo- biles sothat people can surf the Internet wherever they go. Mobile phones and all manner ofconsumer electronics, from game consoles todigital cameras, can com- municate withit. We willcome back toitindetail inChap. 4. 1.5.4 RFID and Sensor Networks The networks we have studied so far are made up of computing devices that are easy to recognize, from computers to mobile phones. With Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID),everyday objects can alsobepartofacomputer network. An RFID tag looks like a postage stamp-sized sticker that can be affixed to (or embedded in)an object sothat it can betracked. The object might be acow, a passport, abookorashipping pallet. The tag consists ofa small microchip with a unique identifier and an antenna that receives radio transmissions. RFID readers installed at tracking points find tags when they come into range and interrogate them for their information as shown in Fig. 1-36. Applications include checking identities,managing thesupplychain, timingraces,andreplacing barcodes. There are many kinds of RFID, each with different properties, but perhaps the most fascinating aspect of RFID technology is that most RFID tags have neither an electric plug nor a battery. Instead, all of the energy needed to operate them is supplied in the form of radio waves by RFID readers. This technology is called passive RFID to distinguish it from the (less common) active RFID in which there isapower source onthetag. One common form of RFID is UHF RFID (Ultra-High Frequency RFID). It is used on shipping pallets and some drivers licenses. Readers send signals in 74 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 RFID tag RFID reader Figure1-36. RFIDusedtonetworkeverydayobjects. the 902-928 MHz band in the United States. Tags communicate at distances of several meters by changing the way they reflect the reader signals; the reader is able topickupthese reflections. Thiswayofoperating iscalled backscatter. Another popular kind of RFID is HF RFID (High Frequency RFID). It operates at 13.56 MHz and is likely to be in your passport, credit cards, books, and noncontact payment systems. HF RFID has a short range, typically a meter or less, because the physical mechanism is based on induction rather than back- scatter. There are also other forms of RFID using other frequencies, such as LF RFID (Low Frequency RFID), which was developed before HF RFID and used foranimal tracking. ItisthekindofRFID likelytobeinyourcat. RFID readers must somehow solve the problem of dealing with multiple tags within reading range. This means that a tag cannot simply respond when it hears a reader, or the signals from multiple tags may collide. The solution is similar to the approach taken in 802.11: tags wait for a short random interval before re- spondingwith their identification, which allows the reader to narrow down indivi- dualtags andinterrogate themfurther. Security isanother problem. The abilityofRFID readers toeasily track anob- ject, and hence the person who uses it, can be an invasion of privacy. Unfor- tunately, it is difficult to secure RFID tags because they lack the computation and communication power to run strong cryptographic algorithms', 'Instead, weak measures like passwords (which can easily be cracked) are used. If an identity card can be remotely read by an official at a border, what is to stop the same card frombeingtracked byotherpeople withoutyourknowledge?Notmuch. RFID tags started as identification chips, but are rapidly turning into full- fledged computers. Forexample, many tags have memory that can beupdatedand later queried, so that information about what has happened to the tagged object can be stored with it. Rieback et al. (2006) demonstrated that this means that all of the usual problems of computer malware apply, only now your cat or your passport mightbeusedtospread anRFID virus. A step up in capability from RFID is the sensor network. Sensor networks are deployed to monitor aspects of the physical world. So far, they have mostly been used for scientific experimentation, such as monitoring bird habitats, vol- canic activity, andzebra migration, butbusinessapplications including healthcare, SEC. 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 75 monitoring equipment for vibration, and tracking of frozen, refrigerated, or other- wise perishable goodscannotbetoofar behind. Sensor nodes are small computers, often the size of a key fob, that have tem- perature, vibration, and other sensors. Many nodes are placed in the environment that is to be monitored. Typically, they have batteries, though they may scavenge energy from vibrations or the sun. As with RFID, having enough energy is a key challenge, and the nodes must communicate carefully to be able to deliver their sensor information to an external collection point. A common strategy is for the nodes to self-organize to relay messages for each other, as shown in Fig.1-37. Thisdesigniscalled amultihop network. Wireless hop Sensor node Data collection point Figure1-37. Multihoptopologyofasensornetwork. RFID and sensor networks are likely to become much more capable and per- vasive inthefuture. Researchers have already combined thebestofbothtechnolo- gies by prototyping programmable RFID tags with light, movement, and other sensors(Sample etal., 2008). 1.6 NETWORK STANDARDIZATION Many network vendors and suppliers exist, each with its own ideas of how things shouldbe done. Without coordination, there would be complete chaos, and users would get nothing done. The only way out is to agree on some network standards. Notonlydogoodstandards allow different computers tocommunicate, but they also increase the market for products adhering to the standards. A larger market leads to mass production, economies of scale in manufacturing, better im- plementations, and other benefits that decrease price and further increase ac- ceptance. In this section we will take a quick look at the important but little-known, world of international standardization. But let us first discuss what belongs in a 76 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 standard. A reasonable person might assume that a standard tells you how a pro- tocol should work so that you can do a good job of implementing it. That person wouldbewrong. Standards define what is needed for interoperability: no more, no less. That lets the larger market emerge and also lets companies compete on the basis of how good their products are', 'For example, the 802.11 standard defines many transmission rates but does not say when a sender should use which rate, which is a key factor in good performance. That is up to whoever makes the product. Often getting to interoperability this way is difficult, since there are many imple- mentation choices and standards usually define many options. For 802.11, there were so many problems that, in a strategy that has become common practice, a trade groupcalled the WiFi Alliance was started towork oninteroperabilitywith- inthe802.11standard. Similarly, a protocol standard defines the protocol over the wire but not the service interface inside the box, except to help explain the protocol. Real service interfaces are often proprietary. For example, the way TCP interfaces to IP within acomputer does notmatter fortalking toaremote host. Itonlymatters thatthere- mote host speaks TCP/IP. In fact, TCP and IP are commonly implemented toget- her without any distinct interface. That said, good service interfaces, like good APIs, are valuable for getting protocols used, and the best ones (such as Berkeley sockets) can become verypopular. Standards fall into two categories: de facto and de jure. De facto (Latin for ‘‘from the fact’’) standards are those that have just happened, without any formal plan. HTTP, the protocol on which the Web runs, started life as a de facto stan- dard. It was part of early WWW browsers developed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, and its use took off with the growth of the Web. Bluetooth is another ex- ample. Itwas originally developed byEricsson butnoweveryoneisusingit. De jure (Latin for ‘‘by law’’) standards, in contrast, are adopted through the rules of some formal standardization body. International standardization authori- ties are generally divided into two classes: those established by treaty among national governments, and those comprising voluntary, nontreaty organizations. In the area of computer network standards, there are several organizations of each type,notablyITU, ISO, IETF andIEEE,all ofwhichwewilldiscuss below. In practice, the relationships between standards, companies, and stan- dardization bodies are complicated. De facto standards often evolve into de jure standards, especially if they are successful. This happened in the case of HTTP, which was quickly picked up by IETF. Standards bodies often ratify each others’ standards, in what looks like patting one another on the back, to increase the market for a technology. These days, many ad hoc business alliances that are formed around particular technologies also play a significant role in developing and refining network standards. For example, 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project)isacollaboration between telecommunications associations thatdrivestheUMTS3Gmobile phonestandards. SEC. 1.6 NETWORK STANDARDIZATION 77 1.6.1 Who’s Who in the Telecommunications World The legal status of the world’s telephone companies varies considerably from countrytocountry. Atoneextreme istheUnited States, which hasover2000sep- arate, (mostly very small) privately owned telephone companies. A few more were added with the breakup of AT&T in 1984 (which was then the world’s larg- est corporation, providing telephone service to about 80 percent of America’s telephones), and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that overhauled regulation tofoster competition', 'At the other extreme are countries in which the national government has a complete monopoly on all communication, including the mail, telegraph, tele- phone, and often radio and television. Much of the world falls into this category. In some cases the telecommunication authority is a nationalized company, and in others it is simply a branch of the government, usually known as the PTT (Post, Telegraph & Telephone administration). Worldwide, the trend istoward liberal- ization and competition and away from government monopoly. Most European countries have now (partially) privatized their PTTs, but elsewhere the process is stillonlyslowlygainingsteam. With all these different suppliersofservices, there is clearly a need toprovide compatibility on a worldwide scale to ensure that people (and computers) in one country can call their counterparts in another one. Actually, this need has existed for a long time. In 1865, representatives from many European governments met to form the predecessor to today’s ITU (International Telecommunication Union). Its job was to standardize international telecommunications, which in those days meant telegraphy. Even then it was clear that if half the countries used Morse code andthe other halfusedsomeother code, there wasgoingtobeaprob- lem. Whenthetelephonewasputintointernational service, ITU tookover the job of standardizing telephony (pronounced te-LEF-ony) as well. In 1947, ITU becameanagency oftheUnited Nations. ITUhasabout200governmentalmembers, including almost every member of the United Nations. Since the United States does not have a PTT, somebody else had to represent it in ITU. This task fell to the State Department, probably on the grounds that ITU had to do with foreign countries, the State Department’s spe- cialty. ITU also has more than 700 sector and associate members. They include telephone companies (e.g., AT&T, Vodafone, Sprint), telecom equipment manu- facturers (e.g., Cisco, Nokia, Nortel), computer vendors (e.g., Microsoft, Agilent, Toshiba), chip manufacturers (e.g., Intel, Motorola, TI), and other interested com- panies (e.g., Boeing, CBS, VeriSign). ITU has three main sectors. We will focus primarily onITU-T,the Telecom- munications Standardization Sector, which is concerned with telephone and data communication systems. Before 1993, this sector was called CCITT, which is an acronym for its French name, Comite´ Consultatif International Te´le´graphique et Te´le´phonique. ITU-R, the Radiocommunications Sector, is concerned with 78 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 coordinating the use bycompeting interest groupsofradiofrequencies worldwide. The other sector is ITU-D, the Development Sector. It promotes the development of information and communication technologies to narrow the ‘‘digital divide’’ between countries with effective access to the information technologies and coun- tries withlimited access. ITU-T’s task is to make technical recommendations about telephone, tele- graph, and data communication interfaces. These often become internationally recognized standards, though technically the recommendations are only sugges- tions that governments can adopt or ignore, as they wish (because governments are like 13-year-old boys—they do not take kindly to being given orders). In practice, a country that wishes to adopt a telephone standard different from that used by the rest of the world is free to do so, but at the price of cutting itself off from everyone else. This might work for North Korea, but elsewhere it would be areal problem', 'The real work of ITU-T is done in its Study Groups. There are currently 10 Study Groups, often as large as 400 people, that cover topics ranging from tele- phone billingto multimedia services to security. SG 15, for example, standardizes the DSL technologies popularly used to connect to the Internet. In order to make it possible to get anything at all done, the Study Groups are divided into Working Parties, which are in turn divided into Expert Teams, which are in turn divided intoadhocgroups. Once abureaucracy, always abureaucracy. Despite all this, ITU-T actually does get things done. Since its inception, it has produced more than 3000 recommendations, many of which are widely used in practice. For example, Recommendation H.264 (also an ISO standard known as MPEG-4 AVC) is widely used for video compression, and X.509 public key certificates are usedforsecure Web browsinganddigitally signedemail. As the field of telecommunications completes the transition started in the 1980s from being entirely national to being entirely global, standards will become increasingly important, and more and more organizations will want to become involvedinsettingthem. Formoreinformation aboutITU, see Irmer (1994). 1.6.2 Who’s Who in the International Standards World International standards are produced and published by ISO (International † Standards Organization ), a voluntary nontreaty organization founded in 1946. Itsmembers are the national standards organizations ofthe157member countries. These members include ANSI (U.S.), BSI (Great Britain), AFNOR (France), DIN (Germany), and153others. ISOissues standards onatrulyvastnumber ofsubjects, ranging fromnutsand bolts (literally) to telephone pole coatings [not to mention cocoa beans (ISO 2451), fishing nets (ISO 1530), women’s underwear (ISO 4416) and quite a few †Forthepurist,ISO’struenameistheInternationalOrganizationforStandardization. SEC. 1.6 NETWORK STANDARDIZATION 79 other subjects one might not think were subject to standardization]. On issues of telecommunication standards, ISO and ITU-T often cooperate (ISO is a member of ITU-T) to avoid the irony of two official and mutually incompatible interna- tional standards. Over 17,000 standards have been issued, including the OSI standards. ISO has over 200 Technical Committees (TCs), numbered in the order of their crea- tion,eachdealing with aspecific subject. TC1deals with the nutsandbolts(stan- dardizing screw thread pitches). JTC1 deals with information technology, includ- ing networks, computers, and software. It is the first (and so far only) Joint Technical Committee, created in 1987 by merging TC97 with activities in IEC, yet another standardization body. Each TC has subcommittees (SCs) divided into workinggroups(WGs). The real work is done largely in the WGs by over 100,000 volunteers world- wide. Many of these ‘‘volunteers’’ are assigned to work on ISO matters by their employers, whose products are being standardized. Others are government offi- cials keen on having their country’s way of doing things become the international standard. Academic experts also are active inmanyoftheWGs. The procedure used by ISO for adopting standards has been designed to achieve as broad a consensus as possible. The process begins when one of the national standards organizations feels the need for an international standard in some area. A working group is then formed to come up with a CD (Committee Draft)', 'The CD is then circulated to all the member bodies, which get 6 months tocriticize it. Ifasubstantial majority approves, arevised document, called aDIS (Draft International Standard) is produced and circulated for comments and voting. Based on the results of this round, the final text of the IS (International Standard) is prepared, approved, and published. In areas of great controversy, a CD or DIS may have to go through several versions before acquiring enough votes, andthewhole process can take years. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. It used to be called the National Bureau of Standards. It issues standards that are mandatory for purchases made by the U.S. Govern- ment, except for those of the Department of Defense, which defines its own stan- dards. Another major player in the standards world is IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), the largest professional organization in the world. In addition to publishing scores of journals and running hundreds of conferences each year, IEEE has a standardization group that develops standards inthe area of electrical engineering and computing. IEEE’s 802 committee has standardized many kindsofLANs. We willstudysome ofitsoutputlater inthisbook. The ac- tual work is done by a collection of working groups, which are listed in Fig.1-38. The successrate ofthe various 802working groupshasbeen low;havingan802.x number is no guarantee of success. Still, the impact of the success stories (espe- cially 802.3and802.11)ontheindustryandtheworldhasbeen enormous. 80 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Number Topic 802.1 OverviewandarchitectureofLANs 802.2 ↓ Logicallinkcontrol 802.3 * Ethernet 802.4 ↓ Tokenbus(wasbrieflyusedinmanufacturingplants) 802.5 Tokenring(IBM’sentryintotheLANworld) 802.6 ↓ Dualqueuedualbus(earlymetropolitanareanetwork) 802.7 ↓ Technicaladvisorygrouponbroadbandtechnologies 802.8 † Technicaladvisorygrouponfiberoptictechnologies 802.9 ↓ IsochronousLANs(forreal-timeapplications) 802.10↓ VirtualLANsandsecurity 802.11* WirelessLANs(WiFi) 802.12↓ Demandpriority(Hewlett-Packard’s AnyLAN) 802.13 Unluckynumber;nobodywantedit 802.14↓ Cablemodems(defunct:anindustryconsortiumgottherefirst) 802.15* Personalareanetworks(Bluetooth,Zigbee) 802.16* Broadbandwireless(WiMAX) 802.17 Resilientpacketring 802.18 Technicaladvisorygrouponradioregulatoryissues 802.19 Technicaladvisorygrouponcoexistenceofallthesestandards 802.20 Mobilebroadbandwireless(similar to802.16e) 802.21 Mediaindependenthandoff(forroamingovertechnologies) 802.22 Wirelessregionalareanetwork Figure1-38.

The difference can be crudely summed up by saying that the people who come to ITU or ISO standardization meetings wear suits, while the people who come to Internet standardization meetings wear jeans (except whentheymeet inSanDiego, whentheywear shortsandT-shirts). ITU-T and ISO meetings are populated by corporate officials and government civil servants for whom standardization is their job. They regard standardization as a Good Thing and devote their lives to it. Internet people, on the other hand, prefer anarchy as a matter of principle. However, with hundreds of millions of SEC. 1.6 NETWORK STANDARDIZATION 81 people alldoingtheir ownthing, littlecommunication can occur. Thus, standards, however regrettable, are sometimes needed. In this context, David Clark of M.I.T. once made a now-famous remark about Internet standardization consisting of‘‘roughconsensus andrunningcode.’’ When the ARPANET was set up, DoD created an informal committee to oversee it', 'In 1983, the committee was renamed the IAB (Internet Activities Board) and was given a slighter broader mission, namely, to keep the researchers involved with the ARPANET and the Internet pointed more or less in the same direction, an activity not unlike herding cats. The meaning of the acronym ‘‘IAB’’was later changed toInternet Architecture Board. Each of the approximately ten members of the IAB headed a task force on some issue of importance. The IAB met several times a year to discuss results and to give feedback to the DoD and NSF, which were providing most of the funding at this time. When astandard was needed (e.g., anew routing algorithm), the IAB members would thrash it out and then announce the change so the gradu- ate students who were the heart of the software effort could implement it. Com- munication was done by a series of technical reports called RFCs (Request For Comments). RFCs are stored online and can be fetched by anyone interested in them from www.ietf.org/rfc. They are numbered in chronological order of crea- tion. Over 5000nowexist. Wewillrefer tomanyRFCs inthisbook. By 1989, the Internet had grown so large that this highly informal style no longer worked. Many vendors by then offered TCP/IP products and did not want to change them just because ten researchers had thought of a better idea. In the summer of 1989, the IAB was reorganized again. The researchers were moved to the IRTF (Internet Research Task Force), which was made subsidiary to IAB, along with the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). The IAB was repopu- lated with people representing a broader range of organizations than just the re- search community. It was initially a self-perpetuating group, with members serv- ing for a 2-year term and new members being appointed by the old ones. Later, the Internet Society was created, populated by people interested in the Internet. The Internet Society is thus in a sense comparable to ACM or IEEE. It is governedbyelected trustees whoappointtheIAB’smembers. The idea of this split was to have the IRTF concentrate on long-term research while the IETF dealt with short-term engineering issues. The IETF was divided up into working groups, each with a specific problem to solve. The chairmen of these working groups initially met as a steering committee to direct the engineer- ing effort. The working group topics include new applications, user information, OSI integration, routing and addressing, security, network management, and stan- dards. Eventually, somany working groups were formed (more than 70) that they were groupedintoareas andthearea chairmen metasthesteering committee. In addition, a more formal standardization process was adopted, patterned after ISOs. To become a Proposed Standard, the basic idea must be explained in an RFC and have sufficient interest in the community to warrant consideration. 82 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 To advance to the Draft Standard stage, a working implementation must have been rigorously tested by at least two independent sites for at least 4 months. If the IAB is convinced that the idea is sound and the software works, it can declare the RFC to be an Internet Standard', 'Some Internet Standards have become DoDstandards (MIL-STD), makingthemmandatory forDoDsuppliers. For Web standards, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops pro- tocols and guidelines tofacilitatethe long-termgrowth ofthe Web. Itisan indus- try consortium led by Tim Berners-Lee and set up in 1994 as the Web really begun to take off. W3C now has more than 300 members from around the world and has produced more than 100 W3C Recommendations, as its standards are called, covering topics suchasHTML andWeb privacy. 1.7 METRIC UNITS To avoid any confusion, it is worth stating explicitly that in this book, as in computer science in general, metric units are used instead of traditional English units (the furlong-stone-fortnight system). The principal metric prefixes are listed in Fig. 1-39. The prefixes are typically abbreviated by their first letters, with the units greater than 1 capitalized (KB, MB, etc.). One exception (for historical rea- sons) is kbps for kilobits/sec. Thus, a 1-Mbps communication line transmits 106 bits/sec and a 100-psec (or 100-ps) clock ticks every 10 −10 seconds. Since milli and micro both begin with the letter ‘‘m,’’ a choice had to be made. Normally, ‘‘m’’isusedformilliand‘‘μ’’(theGreek letter mu)isusedformicro. Exp. Explicit Prefix Exp. Explicit Prefix 10−3 0.001 milli 103 1,000 Kilo 10−6 0.000001 micro 106 1,000,000 Mega 10−9 0.000000001 nano 109 1,000,000,000 Giga 10−12 0.000000000001 pico 1012 1,000,000,000,000 Tera 10−15 0.000000000000001 femto 1015 1,000,000,000,000,000 Peta 10−18 0.0000000000000000001 atto 1018 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Exa 10−21 0.0000000000000000000001 zepto 1021 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Zetta 10−24 0.0000000000000000000000001 yocto 1024 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Yotta Figure1-39. Theprincipalmetricprefixes. It is also worth pointing out that for measuring memory, disk, file, and data- base sizes, in common industry practice, the units have slightly different mean- ings. There, kilo means 210 (1024) rather than 103 (1000) because memories are always a power of two. Thus, a 1-KB memory contains 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes. Note also the capital ‘‘B’’ in that usage to mean ‘‘bytes’’ (units of eight SEC. 1.7 METRICUNITS 83 bits), instead of a lowercase ‘‘b’’ that means ‘‘bits.’’ Similarly, a 1-MB memory contains 220 (1,048,576) bytes, a 1-GB memory contains 230 (1,073,741,824) bytes, and a 1-TB database contains 240 (1,099,511,627,776) bytes. However, a 1-kbps communication line transmits 1000 bits per second and a 10-Mbps LAN runs at 10,000,000 bits/sec because these speeds are not powers of two. Unfor- tunately, many people tend to mix up these two systems, especially for disk sizes. To avoid ambiguity, in this book, we will use the symbols KB, MB, GB, and TB for 210, 220, 230, and 240 bytes, respectively, and the symbols kbps, Mbps, Gbps, andTbpsfor103,106,109,and1012 bits/sec, respectively. 1.8 OUTLINE OF THE REST OF THE BOOK This book discusses both the principles and practice of computer networking. Most chapters start with a discussion of the relevant principles, followed by a number of examples that illustrate these principles. These examples are usually taken from the Internet and wireless networks such as the mobile phone network since these are both important and very different. Other examples will be given where relevant. The book is structured according to the hybrid model of Fig. 1-23. Starting with Chap', '2, we begin working our way up the protocol hierarchy beginning at the bottom. We provide some background inthe field of data communication that covers both wired and wireless transmission systems. This material is concerned with how to deliver information over physical channels, although we cover only the architectural rather than the hardware aspects. Several examples of the physi- cal layer, such as the public switched telephone network, the mobile telephone network, andthecable television network are alsodiscussed. Chapters 3and 4 discuss the data link layer in two parts. Chap. 3 looks at the problem of how to send packets across a link, including error detection and cor- rection. We look at DSL (used for broadband Internet access over phone lines) as areal-world example ofadata linkprotocol. In Chap. 4, we examine the medium access sublayer. This is the part of the data link layer that deals with how to share a channel between multiple com- puters. The examples we look at include wireless, such as 802.11 and RFID, and wired LANs such as classic Ethernet. Link layer switches that connect LANs, suchasswitched Ethernet, are alsodiscussed here. Chapter 5deals withthenetwork layer, especially routing. Many routingalgo- rithms, both static and dynamic, are covered. Even with good routing algorithms, though, if more traffic is offered than the network can handle, some packets will be delayed or discarded. We discuss this issue from how to prevent congestion to how to guarantee a certain quality of service. Connecting heterogeneous net- works to form internetworks also leads to numerous problems that are discussed here. Thenetwork layer intheInternet isgivenextensive coverage. 84 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Chapter 6 deals with the transport layer. Much of the emphasis is on connec- tion-oriented protocols and reliability, since many applications need these. Both Internet transport protocols, UDP and TCP, are covered in detail, as are their per- formance issues. Chapter 7 deals with the application layer, its protocols, and its applications. The first topic is DNS, which isthe Internet’s telephonebook. Next comes email, including a discussion of its protocols. Then we move on to the Web, with de- tailed discussions of static and dynamic content, and what happens on the client and server sides. We follow this with a look at networked multimedia, including streaming audio and video. Finally, wediscuss content-delivery networks, includ- ingpeer-to-peer technology. Chapter 8 is about network security. This topic has aspects that relate to all layers, so it is easiest to treat it after all the layers have been thoroughly explain- ed. The chapter starts with an introduction to cryptography. Later, it shows how cryptography can be used to secure communication, email, and the Web. The chapter ends with a discussion of some areas in which security collides with privacy, freedom ofspeech,censorship, andother social issues. Chapter 9 contains an annotated list of suggested readings arranged by chap- ter. It is intended to help those readers who would like to pursue their study of networking further. The chapter also has an alphabetical bibliography of all the references cited inthisbook', 'The authors’ Web site atPearson: http://www.pearsonhighered.com/tanenbaum has a page with linkstomany tutorials, FAQs, companies, industryconsortia, pro- fessional organizations, standards organizations, technologies,papers, andmore. 1.9 SUMMARY Computer networks have many uses, both for companies and for individuals, in the home and while on the move. Companies use networks of computers to share corporate information, typically using the client-server model with employee desktops acting as clients accessing powerful servers in the machine room. For individuals, networks offer access to a variety of information and entertainment resources, as well as a way to buy and sell products and services. Individuals often access the Internet via their phone or cable providers at home, though increasingly wireless access is used for laptops and phones. Technology advances are enabling new kinds of mobile applications and networks with com- puters embedded in appliances and other consumer devices. The same advances raise social issues suchasprivacy concerns. Roughly speaking, networks can be divided into LANs, MANs, WANs, and internetworks. LANs typical cover a building and operate at high speeds. MANs SEC. 1.9 SUMMARY 85 usually cover acity.Anexample isthecable television system, which isnowused bymanypeople toaccesstheInternet. WANs maycover acountryoracontinent. Some of the technologies used to build these networks are point-to-point (e.g., a cable) while others are broadcast (e.g.,wireless). Networks can be interconnected with routers to form internetworks, of which the Internet is the largest and best known example. Wireless networks, for example 802.11 LANs and 3G mobile telephony,are alsobecoming extremely popular. Network software is built around protocols, which are rules by which proc- esses communicate. Most networks support protocol hierarchies, with each layer providing services tothe layer above it and insulating them from the details of the protocols used in the lower layers. Protocol stacks are typically based either on the OSI model or on the TCP/IP model. Both have link, network, transport, and application layers, but they differ on the other layers. Design issues include reliability, resource allocation, growth, security, and more. Much of this book deals withprotocols andtheir design. Networks provide various services to their users. These services can range from connectionless best-efforts packet delivery to connection-oriented guaran- teed delivery. In some networks, connectionless service is provided in one layer andconnection-orientedservice isprovided inthelayer aboveit. Well-known networks include the Internet, the 3G mobile telephone network, and 802.11 LANs. The Internet evolved from the ARPANET, to which other net- works were added to form an internetwork. The present-day Internet is actually a collection ofmany thousandsofnetworks that usetheTCP/IP protocol stack. The 3G mobile telephone network provides wireless and mobile access to the Internet at speeds of multiple Mbps, and, of course, carries voice calls as well. Wireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standard are deployed in many homes and cafes and can provide connectivity at rates in excess of 100 Mbps. New kinds of net- works are emerging too, such as embedded sensor networks and networks based onRFIDtechnology. Enabling multiple computers to talk to each other requires a large amount of standardization, both inthe hardware and software. Organizations such as ITU-T, ISO, IEEE,andIABmanage different parts ofthestandardization process. PROBLEMS 1.

This function attaches its header in front of the message,printsthenewmessageonthestandardoutput,andtheninvokestheprotocol function of the lower-layer protocol. Program input is an application message (a se- quenceof80charactersorless). 2 THE PHYSICAL LAYER In this chapter we will look at the lowest layer in our protocol model, the physical layer. It defines the electrical, timing and other interfaces by which bits are sent as signals over channels. The physical layer is the foundation on which the network is built. The properties of different kinds of physical channels deter- mine the performance (e.g., throughput, latency, and error rate) so it is a good placetostart ourjourneyintonetworkland. We will begin with a theoretical analysis of data transmission, only to dis- cover that Mother (Parent?) Nature puts some limits on what can be sent over a channel. Then we will cover three kinds of transmission media: guided (copper wire and fiber optics), wireless (terrestrial radio), and satellite. Each of these technologies has different properties that affect the design and performance of the networks thatusethem. Thismaterial willprovidebackgroundinformation onthe keytransmission technologiesusedinmodern networks. Nextcomes digital modulation,which isall abouthowanalog signals are con- verted into digital bits and back again. After that we will look at multiplexing schemes, exploring how multiple conversations can be put on the same transmis- sionmedium atthesame timewithoutinterfering withoneanother. Finally, we will look at three examples of communication systems used in practice for wide area computer networks: the (fixed) telephone system, the mobile phone system, and the cable television system. Each of these is important inpractice, sowewilldevote afairamountofspacetoeachone. 89 90 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 2.1 THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR DATA COMMUNICATION Information can be transmitted on wires by varying some physical property such as voltage or current. By representing the value of this voltage or current as asingle-valued function oftime, f(t), wecanmodel the behavior ofthe signal and analyze itmathematically. Thisanalysis isthesubject ofthefollowing sections. 2.1.1 Fourier Analysis In the early 19th century, the French mathematician Jean-Baptiste Fourier proved that any reasonably behaved periodic function, g(t) with period T, can be constructed asthesumofa(possiblyinfinite) number ofsinesandcosines: g(t)= 1 c + Σ ∞ a sin(2πnft) + Σ ∞ b cos(2πnft) (2-1) n n 2 n=1 n=1 where f =1/Tisthefundamentalfrequency, a andb are thesineand cosine am- n n plitudes of the nth harmonics (terms), and c is a constant', 'Such a decomposition is called a Fourier series. From the Fourier series, the function can be recon- structed. That is, ifthe period, T,isknownand the amplitudesare given, theorig- inalfunction oftime can befoundbyperforming thesumsofEq.(2-1). A data signal that has a finite duration, which all of them do, can be handled by just imagining that it repeats the entire pattern over and over forever (i.e., the interval fromTto2Tisthesame asfrom0toT,etc.). The a amplitudes can be computed for any given g(t) by multiplying both n sidesofEq.(2-1)bysin(2πkft)andthenintegrating from0toT. Since T ⎧ 0fork ≠n ∫ sin(2πkft)sin(2πnft)dt = ⎨ T/2fork =n ⎩ 0 only one term of the summation survives: a . The b summation vanishes com- n n pletely. Similarly, bymultiplyingEq. (2-1) bycos(2πkft)and integrating between 0 and T, we can derive b . By just integrating both sides of the equation as it n stands, wecanfindc. The results ofperforming these operations are asfollows: T T T a = 2 ∫ g(t)sin(2πnft)dt b = 2 ∫ g(t)cos(2πnft)dt c= 2 ∫ g(t)dt n n T T T 0 0 0 2.1.2 Bandwidth-Limited Signals The relevance of all of this to data communication is that real channels affect different frequency signals differently. Let us consider a specific example: the transmission ofthe ASCII character ‘‘b’’ encoded inan 8-bit byte. The bit pattern that is to be transmitted is 01100010. The left-hand part of Fig. 2-1(a) shows the SEC. 2.1 THETHEORETICAL BASISFORDATACOMMUNICATION 91 voltage output by the transmitting computer. The Fourier analysis of this signal yields thecoefficients: 1 a = [cos(πn/4)−cos(3πn/4)+cos(6πn/4)−cos(7πn/4)] n πn 1 b = [sin(3πn/4)−sin(πn/4)+sin(7πn/4)−sin(6πn/4)] n πn c =3/4 √ The root-mean-square amplitudes, a2 +b2, forthe first few terms are shown on n n the right-hand side of Fig. 2-1(a). These values are of interest because their squares are proportionaltotheenergy transmittedatthecorrespondingfrequency. Notransmission facilitycan transmit signals withoutlosingsome power inthe process. If all the Fourier components were equally diminished, the resulting sig- nal would be reduced in amplitude but not distorted [i.e., it would have the same nice squared-off shape as Fig.2-1(a)]. Unfortunately, all transmission facilities diminish different Fourier components by different amounts, thus introducing dis- tortion. Usually, for a wire, the amplitudes are transmitted mostly undiminished from 0 up to some frequency f [measured in cycles/sec or Hertz (Hz)], with all c frequencies above this cutoff frequency attenuated. The width of the frequency range transmitted without being strongly attenuated is called the bandwidth. In practice, the cutoff is not really sharp, so often the quoted bandwidth is from 0 to thefrequency atwhichthereceivedpower hasfallen byhalf. The bandwidth is a physical property of the transmission medium that de- pends on, for example, the construction, thickness, and length of a wire or fiber. Filters are often used to further limit the bandwidth of a signal. 802.11 wireless channels are allowed to use up to roughly 20 MHz, for example, so 802.11 radios filter the signal bandwidth to this size. As another example, traditional (analog) television channels occupy 6 MHz each, on a wire or over the air. This filtering lets more signals share a given region of spectrum, which improves the overall ef- ficiency of the system', 'It means that the frequency range for some signals will not start at zero, but this does not matter. The bandwidth is still the width of the band of frequencies that are passed, and the information that can be carried de- pends only on this width and not on the starting and ending frequencies. Signals that run from 0 up to a maximum frequency are called baseband signals. Signals that are shifted tooccupya higher range of frequencies, as is the case for all wire- lesstransmissions, are called passband signals. Now let us consider how the signal of Fig. 2-1(a) would look if the bandwidth were so low that only the lowest frequencies were transmitted [i.e., if the function were being approximated by the first few terms of Eq. (2-1)]. Figure 2-1(b) shows the signal that results from a channel that allows only the first harmonic 92 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 Time T 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 Time edutilpmasmr 0.50 0.25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101112131415 Harmonicnumber (a) 1harmonic 1 (b) 2harmonics 1 2 (c) 4harmonics 1 2 3 4 (d) 8harmonics 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Harmonicnumber (e) Figure2-1.

SEC. 2.1 THETHEORETICAL BASISFORDATACOMMUNICATION 93 (the fundamental, f) to pass through. Similarly, Fig.2-1(c)–(e) show the spectra and reconstructed functions for higher-bandwidth channels. For digital transmis- sion, the goal is to receive a signal with just enough fidelity to reconstruct the se- quence of bits that was sent. We can already do this easily in Fig.2-1(e), so it is wasteful tousemore harmonics toreceiveamore accuratereplica. Given a bit rate of b bits/sec, the time required to send the 8 bits in our ex- ample 1 bit at a time is 8/b sec, so the frequency of the first harmonic of this sig- nal is b/8Hz. An ordinary telephone line, often called a voice-grade line, has an artificially introduced cutoff frequency just above 3000 Hz. The presence of this restriction means that the number of the highest harmonic passed through is roughly3000/(b/8),or24,000/b(thecutoff isnotsharp). For some data rates, the numbers work out as shown in Fig.2-2. From these numbers, it is clear that trying to send at 9600 bps over a voice-grade telephone line will transform Fig.2-1(a) into something looking like Fig.2-1(c), making accurate reception of the original binary bit stream tricky. It should be obvious thatatdata rates muchhigherthan38.4kbps,there isnohopeatall forbinary sig- nals, even ifthe transmission facilityiscompletely noiseless. Inother words,lim- iting the bandwidth limits the data rate, even for perfect channels. However, cod- ingschemes thatmake useofseveral voltage levels doexistandcan achieve high- erdata rates. We willdiscuss these later inthischapter.

Relationbetweendatarateandharmonicsforourexample. There ismuch confusion aboutbandwidth because it means different things to electrical engineers and to computer scientists', 'To electrical engineers, (analog) bandwidth is (as we have described above) a quantity measured in Hz. To com- puter scientists, (digital) bandwidth is the maximum data rate of a channel, a quantity measured in bits/sec. That data rate is the end result of using the analog bandwidth of a physical channel for digital transmission, and the two are related, as we discuss next. In this book, it will be clear from the context whether we mean analog bandwidth (Hz) ordigital bandwidth (bits/sec). 94 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 2.1.3 The Maximum Data Rate of aChannel Asearly as1924,anAT&T engineer, Henry Nyquist,realized that even a per- fect channel has a finite transmission capacity. Hederived anequation expressing the maximum data rate for a finite-bandwidth noiseless channel. In 1948, Claude Shannon carried Nyquist’s work further and extended it to the case of a channel subject to random (that is, thermodynamic) noise (Shannon, 1948). This paper is the most important paper in all of information theory. We will just briefly sum- marize their nowclassical results here. Nyquist proved that if an arbitrary signal has been run through a low-pass fil- ter of bandwidth B, the filtered signal can be completely reconstructed by making only 2B (exact) samples per second. Sampling the line faster than 2B times per second is pointless because the higher-frequency components that such sampling could recover have already been filtered out. If the signal consists of V discrete levels, Nyquist’stheorem states: maximum data rate =2Blog V bits/sec (2-2) 2 For example, a noiseless 3-kHz channel cannot transmit binary (i.e., two-level) signals atarate exceeding6000bps. So far we have considered only noiseless channels. If random noise is pres- ent, the situation deteriorates rapidly. Andthere isalways random(thermal) noise present due to the motion of the molecules in the system. The amount of thermal noise present ismeasured bythe ratio ofthe signal power tothe noise power, call- ed the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio). If we denote the signal power by S and the noise power by N, the signal-to-noise ratio is S/N. Usually, the ratio is expressed on a log scale as the quantity 10log S/N because it can vary over a tremendous 10 range. The units of this log scale are called decibels (dB), with ‘‘deci’’ meaning 10 and ‘‘bel’’ chosen to honor Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the tele- phone. An S/N ratio of 10 is 10 dB, a ratio of 100 is 20 dB, a ratio of 1000 is 30 dB, and so on. The manufacturers of stereo amplifiers often characterize the bandwidth (frequency range) over which their products are linear by giving the 3- dB frequency on each end. These are the points at which the amplification factor hasbeenapproximately halved (because10log 0.5 ∼∼−3). 10 Shannon’s major result is that the maximum data rate or capacity of a noisy channel whose bandwidth is B Hz and whose signal-to-noise ratio is S/N, is given by: maximum number ofbits/sec =Blog (1+S/N) (2-3) 2 This tells us the best capacities that real channels can have', 'For example, ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), which provides Internet access over nor- mal telephone lines, uses a bandwidth of around 1 MHz. The SNR depends strongly onthe distance of the home from the telephone exchange, and an SNR of around 40 dB for short lines of 1 to 2 km is very good. With these characteristics, SEC. 2.1 THETHEORETICAL BASISFORDATACOMMUNICATION 95 the channel can never transmit much more than 13 Mbps, no matter how many or how few signal levels are used and no matter how often or how infrequently sam- ples are taken. In practice, ADSL is specified up to 12 Mbps, though users often see lower rates. This data rate is actually very good, with over 60 years of com- munications techniques having greatly reduced the gap between the Shannon ca- pacity andthecapacity ofreal systems. Shannon’s result was derived from information-theory arguments and applies toanychannel subject tothermal noise. Counterexamplesshouldbe treated inthe same category as perpetual motion machines. For ADSL to exceed 13 Mbps, it must either improve the SNR (for example by inserting digital repeaters in the lines closer to the customers) or use more bandwidth, as is done with the evolu- tiontoASDL2+. 2.2 GUIDED TRANSMISSION MEDIA The purpose of the physical layer is to transport bits from one machine to an- other. Various physical media can be used for the actual transmission. Each one has its own niche in terms of bandwidth, delay, cost, and ease of installation and maintenance. Media are roughly grouped into guided media, such as copper wire and fiber optics, and unguided media, such as terrestrial wireless, satellite, and lasers through the air. We will look at guided media in this section, and unguided media inthenextsections. 2.2.1 Magnetic Media Oneofthemostcommonways totransport data fromone computer toanother is to write them onto magnetic tape or removable media (e.g., recordable DVDs), physically transport the tape or disks to the destination machine, and read them back in again. Although this method is not as sophisticated as using a geosyn- chronous communication satellite, it is often more cost effective, especially for applications inwhich highbandwidth orcostperbittransported isthekeyfactor. Asimple calculation willmake this pointclear. Anindustry-standard Ultrium tape can hold800gigabytes. Abox60×60×60cm can holdabout1000ofthese tapes, for a total capacity of 800 terabytes, or 6400 terabits (6.4 petabits). A box of tapes can be delivered anywhere in the United States in 24 hours by Federal Express and other companies. The effective bandwidth of this transmission is 6400 terabits/86,400 sec, or a bit over 70 Gbps. If the destination is only an hour away by road, the bandwidth is increased to over 1700 Gbps. No computer net- work can even approach this. Of course, networks are gettingfaster, buttape den- sitiesare increasing, too. If we now look at cost, we get a similar picture. The cost of an Ultrium tape is around $40 when bought in bulk. A tape can be reused at least 10 times, so the 96 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 tape cost is maybe $4000 per box per usage', 'Add to this another $1000 for ship- ping (probably much less), and we have a cost of roughly $5000 to ship 800 TB. This amounts to shipping a gigabyte for a little over half a cent. No network can beat that. The moral ofthestoryis: Neverunderestimatethebandwidthofastationwagonfulloftapes hurtlingdownthehighway. 2.2.2 Twisted Pairs Althoughthe bandwidth characteristics of magnetic tape are excellent, the de- lay characteristics are poor. Transmission time is measured in minutes or hours, not milliseconds. For many applications an online connection is needed. One of the oldest and still most common transmission media is twisted pair. A twisted pair consists oftwoinsulated copperwires, typically about1mmthick. The wires are twisted together ina helical form, justlike aDNAmolecule. Twisting isdone because two parallel wires constitute a fine antenna. When the wires are twisted, the waves from different twists cancel out, sothe wire radiates less effectively. A signal is usually carried as the difference in voltage between the two wires in the pair. This provides better immunity to external noise because the noise tends to affect bothwires thesame, leaving thedifferential unchanged. The most common application of the twisted pair is the telephone system. Nearly all telephones are connected to the telephone company (telco) office by a twisted pair. Both telephone calls and ADSL Internet access run over these lines. Twisted pairs can run several kilometers without amplification, butfor longer dis- tances the signal becomes too attenuated and repeaters are needed. When many twisted pairs runinparallel forasubstantial distance, such as allthewires coming from an apartment building to the telephone company office, they are bundled to- gether and encased in a protective sheath. The pairs inthese bundleswould inter- fere with one another if it were not for the twisting. In parts of the world where telephone lines run on poles above ground, it is common to see bundles several centimeters indiameter. Twisted pairscan beusedfortransmittingeither analog ordigital information. The bandwidth depends on the thickness of the wire and the distance traveled, but several megabits/sec can be achieved for a few kilometers in many cases. Due to their adequate performance and low cost, twisted pairs are widely used and are likely toremain soforyears tocome. Twisted-pair cabling comes in several varieties. The garden variety deployed in many office buildings is called Category 5 cabling, or ‘‘Cat 5.’’ A category 5 twisted pair consists of two insulated wires gently twisted together. Four such pairs are typically grouped in a plastic sheath to protect the wires and keep them together. Thisarrangement isshowninFig.2-3. Different LAN standards may use the twisted pairs differently. For example, 100-Mbps Ethernet uses two (out of the four) pairs, one pair for each direction. SEC. 2.2 GUIDEDTRANSMISSION MEDIA 97 Twistedpair Figure2-3. Category5UTPcablewithfourtwistedpairs. To reach higher speeds, 1-Gbps Ethernet uses all four pairs in both directions si- multaneously; this requires the receiver to factor out the signal that is transmitted locally. Some general terminology is now in order. Links that can be used in both di- rections at the same time, like a two-lane road, are called full-duplex links', 'In contrast, links that can be used ineither direction, butonly one way at a time, like a single-track railroad line. are called half-duplex links. A third category con- sists of links that allow traffic in only one direction, like a one-way street. They are called simplex links. Returning to twisted pair, Cat 5 replaced earlier Category 3 cables with a similar cable that uses the same connector, but has more twists per meter. More twists result in less crosstalk and a better-quality signal over longer distances, making the cables more suitable for high-speed computer communication, espe- cially 100-Mbpsand1-GbpsEthernet LANs. New wiring is more likely to be Category 6 or even Category 7. These categories has more stringent specifications to handle signals with greater band- widths. Some cables in Category 6 and above are rated for signals of 500 MHz andcan supportthe10-Gbpslinksthatwillsoonbedeployed. Through Category 6, these wiring types are referred to as UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) as they consist simply of wires and insulators. In contrast to these, Category 7cables have shielding ontheindividual twisted pairs, as well as around the entire cable (but inside the plastic protective sheath). Shielding reduces the susceptibility to external interference and crosstalk with other nearby cables to meet demanding performance specifications. The cables are reminiscent of the high-quality, but bulky and expensive shielded twisted pair cables that IBM intro- duced in the early 1980s, but which did not prove popular outside of IBM in- stallations. Evidently, itistime totryagain. 2.2.3 Coaxial Cable Another common transmission medium is the coaxial cable (known to its many friends as just ‘‘coax’’andpronounced‘‘co-ax’’). Ithasbetter shielding and greater bandwidth than unshielded twisted pairs, so it can span longer distances at 98 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 higher speeds. Two kinds of coaxial cable are widely used. One kind, 50-ohm cable, is commonly used when it is intended for digital transmission from the start. The other kind, 75-ohm cable, is commonly used for analog transmission and cable television. This distinction is based on historical, rather than technical, factors (e.g., early dipole antennas had an impedance of 300 ohms, and it was easy to use existing 4:1 impedance-matching transformers). Starting in the mid- 1990s, cable TV operators began to provide Internet access over cable, which has made 75-ohmcable more important fordata communication. A coaxial cable consists of a stiff copper wire as the core, surrounded by an insulating material. The insulator isencased byacylindrical conductor,often asa closely woven braided mesh. The outer conductor is covered in a protective plas- ticsheath. Acutaway viewofacoaxial cable isshowninFig.2-4. Copper Insulating Braided Protective core material outer plastic conductor covering Figure2-4. Acoaxialcable. The construction andshielding ofthecoaxial cable give it agoodcombination of high bandwidth and excellent noise immunity. The bandwidth possible de- pends onthe cable qualityandlength. Modern cables have abandwidth ofuptoa few GHz. Coaxial cables used to be widely used within the telephone system for long-distance lines but have now largely been replaced by fiber optics on long- haul routes. Coax is still widely used for cable television and metropolitan area networks, however', '2.2.4 Power Lines The telephone and cable television networks are not the only sources of wir- ing that can be reused for data communication. There is a yet more common kind of wiring: electrical power lines. Power lines deliver electrical power to houses, andelectrical wiringwithin housesdistributes thepower toelectrical outlets. The use of power lines for data communication is an old idea. Power lines have been used by electricity companies for low-rate communication such as re- mote metering for many years, as well in the home to control devices (e.g., the X10 standard). In recent years there has been renewed interest in high-rate com- munication over these lines, both inside the home as a LAN and outside the home SEC. 2.2 GUIDEDTRANSMISSION MEDIA 99 for broadband Internet access. We willconcentrate onthe mostcommon scenario: usingelectrical wires inside thehome. The convenienceof usingpower lines fornetworking shouldbeclear. Simply plug a TV and a receiver into the wall, which you must do anyway because they need power, andthey can send and receive movies over the electrical wiring. This configuration is shown in Fig. 2-5. There is no other plug or radio. The data sig- nal is superimposed on the low-frequency power signal (on the active or ‘‘hot’’ wire) asbothsignalsusethewiring atthesame time. Electriccable Datasignal Powersignal Figure2-5. Anetworkthatuseshouseholdelectricalwiring. The difficulty with using household electrical wiring for a network is that it was designed to distribute power signals. This task is quite different than distri- buting data signals, at which household wiring does a horrible job. Electrical sig- nals are sent at 50–60 Hz and the wiring attenuates the much higher frequency (MHz) signals needed for high-rate data communication. The electrical properties of the wiring vary from one house tothe next and change as appliances are turned onand off, which causes data signals to bounce around the wiring. Transient cur- rents when appliances switch on and off create electrical noise over a wide range of frequencies. And without the careful twisting of twisted pairs, electrical wiring acts as a fine antenna, picking upexternal signals and radiating signals of its own. This behavior means that to meet regulatory requirements, the data signal must exclude licensed frequencies suchastheamateur radiobands. Despite these difficulties, it is practical to send at least 100 Mbps over typical household electrical wiring by using communication schemes that resist impaired frequencies and bursts of errors. Many products use various proprietary standards for power-line networking, so international standards are actively under develop- ment. 2.2.5 Fiber Optics Many people in the computer industry take enormous pride in how fast com- puter technology is improving as it follows Moore’s law, which predicts a dou- bling of the number of transistors per chip roughly every two years (Schaller, 100 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 1997). The original (1981) IBM PC ran at a clock speed of 4.77 MHz. Twenty- eight years later, PCs could run a four-core CPU at 3GHz. This increase is a gain ofafactor ofaround2500,or16perdecade.Impressive. In the same period, wide area communication links went from 45 Mbps (a T3 line in the telephone system) to 100 Gbps (a modern long distance line)', 'This gain is similarly impressive, more than a factor of 2000 and close to 16 per decade, while at the same time the error rate went from 10 −5 per bit to almost zero. Furthermore, single CPUs are beginning to approach physical limits, which is why it is now the number of CPUs that is being increased per chip. In contrast, the achievable bandwidth with fiber technology is in excess of 50,000 Gbps (50 Tbps) and we are nowhere near reaching these limits. The current practical limit of around 100 Gbps is due to our inability to convert between electrical and opti- cal signals any faster. To build higher-capacity links, many channels are simply carried inparallel overasingle fiber. In this section we will study fiber optics to learn how that transmission tech- nology works. In the ongoing race between computing and communication, com- munication may yet win because of fiber optic networks. The implication of this would beessentially infinite bandwidth anda new conventionalwisdom that com- puters are hopelessly slow so that networks should try to avoid computation at all costs, no matter how much bandwidth that wastes. This change will take a while to sink in to a generation of computer scientists and engineers taught to think in terms ofthelowShannonlimitsimposed bycopper. Of course, this scenario does not tell the whole story because it does not in- clude cost. The cost to install fiber over the last mile to reach consumers and bypass the low bandwidth of wires and limited availability of spectrum is tremen- dous. It also costs more energy to move bits than to compute. We may always have islands of inequities where either computation or communication is essen- tially free. For example, at the edge of the Internet we throw computation and storage at the problem of compressing and caching content, all to make better use of Internet access links. Within the Internet, we may do the reverse, with com- panies such as Google moving huge amounts of data across the network to where itischeaper tostoreorcompute onit. Fiber optics are used for long-haul transmission in network backbones, high- speed LANs (although so far, copper has always managed catch up eventually), and high-speed Internet access such as FttH (Fiber to the Home). An optical transmission system has three key components: the light source, the transmission medium, and the detector. Conventionally, a pulse of light indicates a 1 bit and the absence of light indicates a 0 bit. The transmission medium is an ultra-thin fiber ofglass. The detector generates anelectrical pulsewhen light falls onit. By attaching a light source to one end of an optical fiber and a detector to the other, we have a unidirectional data transmission system that accepts an electrical sig- nal, converts and transmits it by light pulses, and then reconverts the output to an electrical signal atthereceivingend. SEC. 2.2 GUIDEDTRANSMISSION MEDIA 101 This transmission system would leak light and be useless in practice were it not for an interesting principle of physics', 'When a light ray passes from one medium to another—for example, from fused silica to air—the ray is refracted (bent) at the silica/air boundary, as shown in Fig. 2-6(a). Here we see a light ray incident on the boundary at an angle α emerging at an angle β . The amount of 1 1 refraction depends on the properties of the two media (in particular, their indices of refraction). For angles of incidence above a certain critical value, the light is refracted back into the silica; none of it escapes into the air. Thus, a light ray incident at or above the critical angle is trapped inside the fiber, as shown in Fig.2-6(b), andcan propagate formanykilometers withvirtually noloss.

The sketch of Fig. 2-6(b) shows only one trapped ray, but since any light ray incident on the boundary above the critical angle will be reflected internally, many different rays will be bouncing around at different angles. Each ray is said to have a different mode, so a fiber having this property is called a multimode fiber. However, if the fiber’s diameter is reduced to a few wavelengths of light the fiber acts like a wave guide and the light can propagate only in a straight line, without bouncing,yielding a single-mode fiber. Single-mode fibers are more ex- pensive but are widely used for longerdistances. Currently available single-mode fibers can transmit data at 100 Gbps for 100 km without amplification. Even higher data rates have been achieved inthelaboratory forshorter distances. Transmission ofLight Through Fiber Optical fibers are made of glass, which, in turn, is made from sand, an inex- pensive raw material available in unlimited amounts. Glassmaking was known to the ancient Egyptians, but their glass had to be no more than 1 mm thick or the 102 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 light could not shine through. Glass transparent enough to be useful for windows was developed during the Renaissance. The glass used for modern optical fibers is so transparent that if the oceans were full of it instead of water, the seabed would be as visible from the surface as the ground is from an airplane on a clear day. The attenuation of light through glass depends on the wavelength of the light (as well as on some physical properties of the glass). It is defined as the ratio of input to output signal power. For the kind of glass used in fibers, the attenuation is shown in Fig.2-7 in units of decibels per linear kilometer of fiber. For exam- ple,afactor oftwolossofsignal power gives anattenuation of10log 2 =3dB. 10 The figure shows the near-infrared part of the spectrum, which is what is used in practice. Visible light has slightly shorter wavelengths, from 0.4 to 0.7 microns. (1 micron is 10 −6 meters.) The true metric purist would refer to these wave- lengths as400nmto700nm,butwewillstick withtraditionalusage', '0.85μ 1.30μ 1.55μ 2.0 Band Band Band 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Wavelength(microns) )mk/Bd(noitaunettA 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 Figure2-7.

They are centered at 0.85, 1.30, and 1.55 microns, respectively. All three bandsare 25,000to30,000GHz wide. The0.85-micron bandwas used first. It has higher attenuation and so is used for shorter distances, but at that wave- length the lasers and electronics could be made from the same material (gallium arsenide). The last two bands have good attenuation properties (less than 5% loss per kilometer). The 1.55-micron band is now widely used with erbium-doped amplifiers thatworkdirectly intheoptical domain. SEC. 2.2 GUIDEDTRANSMISSION MEDIA 103 Light pulses sent down a fiber spread out in length as they propagate. This spreading is called chromatic dispersion. The amount ofit iswavelength depen- dent. One way tokeep these spread-out pulses from overlapping isto increase the distance between them, but this can be done only by reducing the signaling rate. Fortunately, it has been discovered that making the pulses in a special shape relat- ed to the reciprocal of the hyperbolic cosine causes nearly all the dispersion ef- fects cancel out, so it is possible to send pulses for thousands of kilometers with- outappreciable shape distortion. These pulsesare called solitons. Aconsiderable amountofresearch isgoingontotake solitonsoutofthelabandintothefield. Fiber Cables Fiber optic cables are similar to coax, except without the braid. Figure 2-8(a) shows a single fiber viewed from the side. At the center is the glass core through which the light propagates. In multimode fibers, the core is typically 50 microns in diameter, about the thickness of a human hair. In single-mode fibers, the core is8to10microns. Sheath Jacket Core (glass) Cladding Jacket (glass) (plastic) Core Cladding (a) (b) Figure2-8. (a)Sideviewofasinglefiber.(b)Endviewofasheathwiththreefibers. The core is surrounded by a glass cladding with a lower index of refraction than the core, to keep all the light in the core. Next comes a thin plastic jacket to protect the cladding. Fibers are typically grouped in bundles, protected by an outer sheath. Figure 2-8(b)showsasheath withthree fibers. Terrestrial fiber sheaths are normally laid in the ground within a meter of the surface, where they are occasionally subject to attacks by backhoes or gophers. Near the shore, transoceanic fiber sheaths are buried in trenches by a kind of seaplow. Indeep water, they just lie onthebottom, where theycan besnagged by fishingtrawlers orattacked bygiantsquid. Fibers can be connected in three different ways. First, they can terminate in connectors and be pluggedinto fiber sockets. Connectors lose about10to20%of thelight, buttheymake iteasy toreconfigure systems. Second, they can be spliced mechanically. Mechanical splices just lay the two carefully cut ends next to each other in a special sleeve and clamp them in 104 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 place. Alignment can be improved by passing light through the junction and then making small adjustments to maximize the signal. Mechanical splices take train- edpersonnelabout5minutes andresult ina10%lightloss. Third,twopiecesoffiber can be fused (melted) toforma solidconnection', 'A fusion splice is almost as good as a single drawn fiber, but even here, a small amountofattenuation occurs. For all three kinds of splices, reflections can occur at the point of the splice, andthereflected energy caninterfere withthesignal. Two kinds of light sources are typically used to do the signaling. These are LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and semiconductor lasers. They have different properties, as shown in Fig.2-9. They can be tuned in wavelength by inserting Fabry-Perot or Mach-Zehnder interferometers between the source and the fiber. Fabry-Perot interferometers are simple resonant cavities consisting of two parallel mirrors. The light is incident perpendicular to the mirrors. The length of the cav- ity selects out those wavelengths that fit inside an integral number of times. Mach-Zehnder interferometers separate the light into two beams. The two beams travel slightly different distances. They are recombined at the end and are in phase foronlycertain wavelengths.

AcomparisonofsemiconductordiodesandLEDsaslightsources. The receivingendof anoptical fiber consists of a photodiode, which gives off an electrical pulse when struck bylight. The responsetime ofphotodiodes,which convert the signal from the optical to the electrical domain, limits data rates to about 100 Gbps. Thermal noise is also an issue, so a pulse of light must carry enough energy to be detected. By making the pulses powerful enough, the error rate canbemade arbitrarily small. Comparison ofFiber Optics and Copper Wire It is instructive to compare fiber to copper. Fiber has many advantages. To start with, it can handle much higher bandwidths than copper. This alone would require its use in high-end networks. Due to the low attenuation, repeaters are needed only aboutevery 50km onlonglines, versus aboutevery 5kmforcopper, SEC. 2.2 GUIDEDTRANSMISSION MEDIA 105 resulting in a big cost saving. Fiber also has the advantage of not being affected by power surges, electromagnetic interference, or power failures. Nor is it affect- edbycorrosive chemicals intheair, important forharshfactory environments. Oddly enough, telephone companies like fiber for a different reason: it is thin and lightweight. Many existing cable ducts are completely full, so there is no room to add new capacity. Removing all the copper and replacing it with fiber empties the ducts, and the copper has excellent resale value to copper refiners who see it as very high-grade ore. Also, fiber is much lighter than copper. One thousand twisted pairs 1 km long weigh 8000 kg. Two fibers have more capacity and weigh only 100 kg, which reduces the need for expensive mechanical support systems that must be maintained. For new routes, fiber wins hands down due to its much lower installation cost. Finally, fibers do not leak light and are difficult totap. These properties givefiber goodsecurity against potential wiretappers. Onthe downside, fiber is a less familiar technology requiring skillsnot all en- gineers have, andfibers canbedamaged easily bybeingbenttoomuch. Since op- tical transmission is inherently unidirectional, two-way communication requires either two fibers or two frequency bands on one fiber. Finally, fiber interfaces cost more than electrical interfaces', 'Nevertheless, the future of all fixed data communication over more than short distances is clearly with fiber. For a dis- cussionofallaspects offiber optics andtheir networks, see Hecht (2005). 2.3 WIRELESS TRANSMISSION Our age has given rise to information junkies: people who need to be online all the time. For these mobile users, twisted pair, coax, and fiber optics are of no use. They need to get their ‘‘hits’’ of data for their laptop, notebook, shirt pocket, palmtop, or wristwatch computers without being tethered to the terrestrial com- munication infrastructure. Forthese users, wireless communication istheanswer. In the following sections, we will look at wireless communication in general. It has many other important applications besides providing connectivity to users whowanttosurftheWeb fromthebeach. Wireless has advantages foreven fixed devices in some circumstances. For example, if running a fiber to a building is difficult due to the terrain (mountains, jungles, swamps, etc.), wireless may be better. It is noteworthy that modern wireless digital communication began in the Hawaiian Islands, where large chunks of Pacific Ocean separated the users from their computer center andthetelephonesystem wasinadequate. 2.3.1 The Electromagnetic Spectrum When electrons move, they create electromagnetic waves that can propagate through space (even in a vacuum). These waves were predicted by the British physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 and first observed by the German 106 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1887. The number of oscillations per second of a wave is called its frequency, f, and is measured in Hz (in honor of Heinrich Hertz). The distance between two consecutive maxima (or minima) is called the wavelength,whichisuniversally designated bytheGreek letter λ(lambda). When anantenna oftheappropriate size isattached toanelectrical circuit, the electromagnetic waves can be broadcast efficiently and received by a receiver somedistance away. Allwireless communication isbased onthisprinciple. In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed, no matter what their frequency. This speed, usually called the speed of light, c, is approxi- mately 3×108 m/sec, or about 1 foot (30 cm) per nanosecond. (A case could be made for redefining the foot as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1 nsec rather than basing it on the shoe size of some long-dead king.) In copper or fiber the speed slows to about 2/3 of this value and becomes slightly frequency depen- dent. The speed of light is the ultimate speed limit. No object or signal can ever movefaster thanit. The fundamentalrelation between f,λ,andc(inavacuum) is λf =c (2-4) Since c is a constant, if we know f, we can find λ, and vice versa. As a rule of thumb, when λ is in meters and f is in MHz, λf ∼∼300. For example, 100-MHz waves are about 3 meters long, 1000-MHz waves are 0.3 meters long, and 0.1- meter waves have afrequency of3000MHz. The electromagnetic spectrum is shown in Fig.2-10. The radio, microwave, infrared, and visible light portions of the spectrum can all be used for transmitting information by modulating the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the waves', 'Ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays would be even better, due to their high- er frequencies, but they are hard to produce and modulate, do not propagate well through buildings, and are dangerous to living things. The bands listed at the bot- tom of Fig.2-10 are the official ITU (International Telecommunication Union) names andare based onthewavelengths, sotheLFbandgoesfrom1kmto10km (approximately 30 kHz to 300 kHz). The terms LF, MF, and HF refer to Low, Medium, and High Frequency, respectively. Clearly, when the names were as- signed nobody expected to go above 10 MHz, so the higher bands were later named the Very, Ultra, Super, Extremely, and Tremendously High Frequency bands. Beyond that there are no names, but Incredibly, Astonishingly, and Prodi- giouslyHighFrequency (IHF, AHF,andPHF) wouldsoundnice. We know from Shannon [Eq.(2-3)] that the amount of information that a sig- nal such as an electromagnetic wave can carry depends onthe received power and is proportional to its bandwidth. From Fig. 2-10 it should now be obvious why networking people like fiber optics so much. Many GHz of bandwidth are avail- able to tap for data transmission in the microwave band, and even more in fiber because it is further tothe right in our logarithmic scale. Asanexample, consider the 1.30-micron band of Fig. 2-7, which has a width of 0.17 microns. If we use SEC. 2.3 WIRELESSTRANSMISSION 107 f(Hz)100 102 104 106 108 1010 1012 1014 1016 1018 1020 1022 1024 Radio Microwave Infrared UV X-ray Gammaray Visible light f(Hz)104 105 106 107 108 109 1010 1011 1012 1013 1014 1015 1016 Fiber Twistedpair Satellite Coax Terrestrial optics AM FM microwave Maritime radio radio TV Band LF MF HF VHF UHF SHF EHF THF Figure2-10. Theelectromagnetic spectrumanditsusesforcommunication. Eq.(2-4) to find the start and end frequencies from the start and end wavelengths, we find the frequency range to be about 30,000 GHz. With a reasonable signal- to-noise ratio of10dB,thisis300Tbps. Most transmissions use a relatively narrow frequency band (i.e., Δf/f <<1). They concentrate their signals in this narrow band to use the spectrum efficiently and obtain reasonable data rates by transmitting with enough power. However, in some cases, a wider band is used, with three variations. In frequency hopping spread spectrum, the transmitter hops from frequency to frequency hundreds of times per second. It is popular for military communication because it makes transmissions hard to detect and next to impossible to jam. It also offers good resistance to multipath fading and narrowband interference because the receiver will notbe stuck on an impaired frequency for long enough to shut down commu- nication. This robustness makes it useful for crowded parts of the spectrum, such as the ISM bands we will describe shortly. This technique is used commercially, forexample, inBluetooth andolder versions of802.11. As a curious footnote, the technique was coinvented by the Austrian-born sex goddess Hedy Lamarr, the first woman to appear nude in a motion picture (the 1933Czech film Extase). Her first husband was an armaments manufacturer who told her how easy it was to block the radio signals then used to control torpedoes', 'When shediscovered thathewas sellingweaponstoHitler,she was horrified, dis- guised herself as a maid to escape him, and fled to Hollywood to continue her career as a movie actress. In her spare time, she invented frequency hopping to help the Allied war effort. Her scheme used 88 frequencies, the number of keys 108 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 (and frequencies) on the piano. For their invention, she and her friend, the mu- sical composer George Antheil, received U.S. patent 2,292,387. However, they were unable to convince the U.S. Navy that their invention had any practical use and never received any royalties. Only years after the patent expired did it be- come popular. Asecondformofspread spectrum, direct sequence spread spectrum, uses a code sequence to spread the data signal over a wider frequency band. It is widely used commercially as a spectrally efficient way to let multiple signals share the same frequency band. These signals can be given different codes, a method called CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)that we willreturn tolater in this chap- ter. This method is shown in contrast with frequency hopping in Fig. 2-11. It forms the basis of 3G mobile phone networks and is also used in GPS (Global Positioning System). Even without different codes, direct sequence spread spec- trum, like frequency hopping spread spectrum, can tolerate narrowband inter- ference and multipath fading because only a fraction of the desired signal is lost. It is used in this role in older 802.11b wireless LANs. For a fascinating and de- tailed historyofspread spectrum communication, see Scholtz (1982). Frequency Direct hopping (CDMAuserwith sequence spread differentcode) spread spectrum spectrum Ultrawideband underlay (CDMAuserwith differentcode) Frequency Figure2-11. Spreadspectrumandultra-wideband(UWB)communication. A third method of communication with a wider band is UWB (Ultra- WideBand) communication. UWB sends a series of rapid pulses, varying their positions to communicate information. The rapid transitions lead to a signal that is spread thinly over a very wide frequency band. UWB is defined as signals that have a bandwidth of at least 500 MHz or at least 20% of the center frequency of their frequency band. UWB is also shown in Fig. 2-11. With this much band- width, UWB has the potential to communicate at high rates. Because it is spread across a wide band of frequencies, it can tolerate a substantial amount of relative- ly strong interference from other narrowband signals. Just as importantly, since UWB has very little energy at any given frequency when used for short-range transmission, it does not cause harmful interference to those other narrowband radio signals. It is said to underlay the other signals. This peaceful coexistence has led toits application inwireless PANs that runat upto1Gbps, although com- mercial successhas been mixed. Itcan also be used forimaging throughsolidob- jects (ground,walls, andbodies)oraspart ofprecise location systems. SEC. 2.3 WIRELESSTRANSMISSION 109 We willnowdiscuss howthe various parts ofthe electromagnetic spectrum of Fig.2-11 are used, starting with radio. We will assume that all transmissions use anarrow frequency bandunlessotherwise stated', '2.3.2 Radio Transmission Radio frequency (RF) waves are easy to generate, can travel long distances, and can penetrate buildings easily, so they are widely used for communication, both indoors and outdoors. Radio waves also are omnidirectional, meaning that they travel in all directions from the source, so the transmitter and receiver do not have tobecarefully aligned physically. Sometimes omnidirectional radio is good, but sometimes it is bad. In the 1970s, General Motors decided to equip all its new Cadillacs with computer-con- trolled antilockbrakes. When the driver stepped onthe brake pedal, the computer pulsed the brakes on and off instead of locking them on hard. One fine day an Ohio Highway Patrolman began using his new mobile radio to call headquarters, and suddenly the Cadillac next to him began behaving like a bucking bronco. When the officer pulled the car over, the driver claimed that he had done nothing andthatthecar hadgonecrazy. Eventually, apattern began toemerge: Cadillacswould sometimes goberserk, but only on major highways in Ohio and then only when the Highway Patrol was watching. For a long, long time General Motors could not understand why Cadil- lacs worked fine in all the other states and also on minor roads in Ohio. Only after much searching did they discover that the Cadillac’s wiring made a fine an- tenna forthefrequency usedbytheOhioHighway Patrol’s newradio system. The properties of radio waves are frequency dependent. At low frequencies, radio waves pass through obstacles well, but the power falls off sharply with dis- tance from the source—at least as fast as 1/r2 in air—as the signal energy is spread more thinly over a larger surface. This attenuation is called path loss. At highfrequencies, radio waves tend totravel instraight lines and bounce off obsta- cles. Path loss still reduces power, though the received signal can depend strongly on reflections as well. High-frequency radio waves are also absorbed by rain and other obstacles to a larger extent than are low-frequency ones. At all frequencies, radio waves are subject to interference from motors and other electrical equip- ment. It is interesting to compare the attenuation of radio waves to that of signals in guided media. With fiber, coax and twisted pair, the signal drops by the same fraction per unit distance, for example 20 dB per 100m for twisted pair. With radio, the signal drops bythe same fraction as the distance doubles, for example 6 dB per doubling in free space. This behavior means that radio waves can travel long distances, and interference between users is a problem. For this reason, all governments tightly regulate the use of radio transmitters, with few notable ex- ceptions, whichare discussed later inthischapter. 110 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 In the VLF, LF, and MF bands, radio waves follow the ground, as illustrated in Fig.2-12(a). These waves can be detected for perhaps 1000 km at the lower frequencies, less at the higher ones. AM radio broadcasting uses the MF band, which is why the ground waves from Boston AM radio stations cannot be heard easily in New York', \"Radio waves in these bands pass through buildings easily, which is why portable radios work indoors. The main problem with using these bandsfordata communication istheir lowbandwidth [see Eq.(2-4)]. G wa ro v u e nd I o n o s phere Earth'ssurface Earth'ssurface (a) (b) Figure2-12. (a) IntheVLF,LF,andMFbands,radiowaves followthecurva- tureoftheearth. (b)IntheHFband,theybounceofftheionosphere. Inthe HF and VHF bands, the groundwaves tend to be absorbed bythe earth. However, the waves that reach the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles cir- cling the earth at a height of 100 to 500 km, are refracted by it and sent back to earth, as shown in Fig. 2-12(b). Under certain atmospheric conditions, the signals can bounceseveral times. Amateur radio operators (hams) use these bands to talk longdistance. Themilitaryalso communicate intheHFandVHFbands. 2.3.3 Microwave Transmission Above100MHz, the waves travel innearly straight lines andcan therefore be narrowly focused. Concentrating all the energy into a small beam by means of a parabolic antenna (like the familiar satellite TV dish) gives a much higher signal- to-noise ratio, but the transmitting and receiving antennas must be accurately aligned with each other. In addition, this directionality allows multiple trans- mitters lined upina row tocommunicate with multiple receivers in a row without interference, provided some minimum spacing rules are observed. Before fiber optics, for decades these microwaves formed the heart of the long-distance tele- phonetransmission system. Infact, MCI, oneofAT&T’s first competitorsafter it was deregulated, built its entire system with microwave communications passing between towers tens of kilometers apart. Even the company’s name reflected this (MCI stood for Microwave Communications, Inc.). MCI has since gone over to fiber and through a long series of corporate mergers and bankruptcies in the telecommunications shuffle hasbecome part ofVerizon. SEC. 2.3 WIRELESSTRANSMISSION 111 Microwaves travel in a straight line, so if the towers are too far apart, the earth will get in the way (think about a Seattle-to-Amsterdam link). Thus, re- peaters are needed periodically. The higher the towers are, the farther apart they can be. The distance between repeaters goes upvery roughly with the square root ofthetower height. For100-meter-hightowers, repeaters can be80kmapart. Unlike radio waves at lower frequencies, microwaves do not pass through buildings well. In addition, even though the beam may be well focused at the transmitter, there is still some divergence in space. Some waves may be refracted off low-lying atmospheric layers and may take slightly longer to arrive than the direct waves. The delayed waves may arrive out of phase with the direct wave and thus cancel the signal. This effect is called multipath fading and is often a serious problem. It is weather and frequency dependent. Some operators keep 10% of their channels idle as spares to switch on when multipath fading tem- porarily wipes outsomefrequency band. The demand for more and more spectrum drives operators to yet higher fre- quencies. Bands up to 10 GHz are now in routine use, but at about 4 GHz a new problem sets in: absorption by water. These waves are only a few centimeters long and are absorbed by rain\", 'This effect would be fine if one were planning to buildahugeoutdoormicrowave ovenforroasting passingbirds,butforcommuni- cation it is a severe problem. As with multipath fading, the only solution is to shutofflinksthatare beingrained onandroutearoundthem. In summary, microwave communication is so widely used for long-distance telephone communication, mobile phones, television distribution, and other pur- poses that a severe shortage of spectrum has developed. It has several key advan- tages over fiber. The main one is that no right of way is needed to lay down cables. By buying a small plot of ground every 50 km and putting a microwave tower on it, one can bypass the telephone system entirely. This is how MCI man- aged toget started as a new long-distance telephone company so quickly. (Sprint, another early competitor to the deregulated AT&T, went a completely different route: it was formed by the Southern Pacific Railroad, which already owned a large amountofrightofwayandjustburied fiber nexttothetracks.) Microwave is also relatively inexpensive. Putting up two simple towers (which can be just big poles with four guy wires) and putting antennas on each one may be cheaper than burying 50 km of fiber through a congested urban area orupover amountain,andit may also becheaper thanleasing thetelephonecom- pany’s fiber, especially if the telephone company has not yet even fully paid for thecopperitripped outwhen itputinthefiber. The Politics ofthe Electromagnetic Spectrum To prevent total chaos, there are national and international agreements about who gets to use which frequencies. Since everyone wants a higher data rate, everyone wants more spectrum. National governments allocate spectrum for AM 112 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 and FM radio, television, and mobile phones, as well as for telephone companies, police, maritime, navigation, military, government, and many other competing users. Worldwide, an agency of ITU-R (WRC) tries to coordinate this allocation so devices that work in multiple countries can be manufactured. However, coun- tries are not bound by ITU-R’s recommendations, and the FCC (Federal Commu- nication Commission), which does the allocation for the United States, has occa- sionally rejected ITU-R’s recommendations (usually because they required some politicallypowerful grouptogiveupsomepieceofthespectrum). Even when a piece of spectrum has been allocated to some use, such as mobile phones, there is the additional issue of which carrier is allowed to use which frequencies. Three algorithms were widely used inthe past. The oldest al- gorithm, often called the beauty contest, requires each carrier to explain why its proposal serves the public interest best. Government officials then decide which ofthe nice stories theyenjoymost. Havingsome governmentofficial award prop- erty worth billions of dollars to his favorite company often leads to bribery, corr- uption, nepotism, and worse. Furthermore, even a scrupulously honest govern- ment official who thought that a foreign company could do a better job than any ofthenational companies wouldhave alotofexplaining todo. This observation led to algorithm 2, holding a lottery among the interested companies. The problem with that idea isthat companies withnointerest inusing the spectrum can enter the lottery. If, say, a fast food restaurant or shoe store chain wins,itcan resell thespectrum toacarrier atahugeprofitandwithnorisk', 'Bestowing huge windfalls on alert but otherwise random companies has been severely criticized by many, which led to algorithm 3: auction off the bandwidth to the highest bidder. When the British government auctioned off the frequencies needed for third-generation mobile systems in 2000, it expected to get about $4 billion. It actually received about $40 billion because the carriers got into a feed- ing frenzy, scared to death of missing the mobile boat. This event switched on nearby governments’ greedy bits and inspired them to hold their own auctions. It worked, but it also left some of the carriers with so much debt that they are close to bankruptcy. Even in the best cases, it will take many years to recoup the licensing fee. A completely different approach to allocating frequencies is to not allocate them at all. Instead, let everyone transmit at will, but regulate the power used so that stations have such a short range that they do not interfere with each other. Accordingly, most governments have set aside some frequency bands, called the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands for unlicensed usage. Garage door openers, cordless phones, radio-controlled toys, wireless mice, and numerous other wireless household devices use the ISM bands. To minimize interference between these uncoordinated devices, the FCC mandates that all devices in the ISM bands limit their transmit power (e.g., to 1 watt) and use other techniques to spread their signals over a range of frequencies. Devices may also need to take care toavoidinterference withradar installations. SEC. 2.3 WIRELESSTRANSMISSION 113 The location of these bands varies somewhat from country to country. In the United States, for example, the bands that networking devices use in practice without requiring a FCC license are shown in Fig. 2-13. The 900-MHz band was used for early versions of 802.11, but it is crowded. The 2.4-GHz band is avail- able in most countries and widely used for 802.11b/g and Bluetooth, though it is subject to interference from microwave ovens and radar installations. The 5-GHz part of the spectrum includes U-NII (Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure) bands. The 5-GHz bands are relatively undeveloped but, since they have the most bandwidth and are used by 802.11a, they are quickly gaining inpopularity.

The ability to use the spectrum freely has unleashed a huge amount of innovation in wireless LANs and PANs, evidenced by the widespread deployment of technolo- gies such as 802.11 and Bluetooth. To continue this innovation, more spectrum is needed. One exciting development in the U.S. is the FCC decision in 2009 to allow unlicensed use of white spaces around 700 MHz. White spaces are fre- quency bands that have been allocated but are not being used locally. The tran- sition from analog to all-digital television broadcasts in the U.S', 'in 2010 freed up white spaces around 700 MHz. The only difficulty is that, to use the white spaces, unlicensed devices must be able to detect any nearby licensed trans- mitters, including wireless microphones, that have first rights touse the frequency band. Another flurry of activity is happening around the 60-GHz band. The FCC opened 57 GHz to 64 GHz for unlicensed operation in 2001. This range is an enormous portion of spectrum, more than all the other ISM bands combined, so it can support the kind of high-speed networks that would be needed to stream high-definition TV through the air across your living room. At 60 GHz, radio 114 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 waves are absorbed by oxygen. This means that signals do not propagate far, making them well suited to short-range networks. The high frequencies (60 GHz is in the Extremely High Frequency or ‘‘millimeter’’ band, just below infrared radiation) posed an initial challenge for equipment makers, but products are now onthemarket. 2.3.4 Infrared Transmission Unguided infrared waves are widely used for short-range communication. The remote controls used for televisions, VCRs, and stereos all use infrared com- munication. They are relatively directional, cheap, and easy to build but have a major drawback: they do not pass through solid objects. (Try standing between your remote control and your television and see if it still works.) In general, as we go from long-wave radio toward visible light, the waves behave more and more likelightandlessandlesslikeradio. Onthe other hand, the fact that infrared waves donot pass through solid walls well isalso a plus. Itmeans that aninfrared system inoneroomofabuildingwill not interfere with a similar system in adjacent rooms or buildings: you cannot control your neighbor’s television with your remote control. Furthermore, securi- ty of infrared systems against eavesdropping is better than that of radio systems precisely for this reason. Therefore, no government license is needed to operate an infrared system, in contrast to radio systems, which must be licensed outside the ISM bands. Infrared communication has a limited use on the desktop, for ex- ample, toconnectnotebookcomputers andprinters withtheIrDA (Infrared Data Association)standard, butitisnotamajor player inthecommunication game. 2.3.5 Light Transmission Unguided optical signaling or free-space optics has been in use for centuries. Paul Revere used binary optical signaling from the Old North Church just prior to hisfamous ride. A more modern application is to connect the LANs intwo build- ings via lasers mounted on their rooftops. Optical signaling using lasers is inherently unidirectional, so each end needs its own laser and its own photodetec- tor. This scheme offers very high bandwidth at very low cost and is relatively secure because it is difficult to tap a narrow laser beam. It is also relatively easy toinstall and,unlikemicrowave transmission, doesnotrequire anFCC license. The laser’s strength, a very narrow beam, is also its weakness here. Aiming a laser beam 1 mm wide at a target the size of a pin head 500 meters away requires the marksmanship of a latter-day Annie Oakley. Usually, lenses are put into the system to defocus the beam slightly', 'To add to the difficulty, wind and tempera- ture changes can distort the beam and laser beams also cannot penetrate rain or thick fog, although they normally work well on sunny days. However, many of these factors are notanissuewhentheuseistoconnecttwospacecraft. SEC. 2.3 WIRELESSTRANSMISSION 115 One of the authors (AST) once attended a conference at a modern hotel in Europe at which the conference organizers thoughtfully provided a room full of terminals to allow the attendees to read their email during boring presentations. Since the local PTT was unwilling to install a large number of telephone lines for just 3days, the organizers put a laser on the roof and aimed it at their university’s computer science building a few kilometers away. They tested it the night before the conference and it worked perfectly. At 9A.M. on a bright, sunny day, the link failed completely and stayed down all day. The pattern repeated itself the next two days. It was not until after the conference that the organizers discovered the problem: heat from the sun during the daytime caused convection currents to rise upfromtheroofofthebuilding,asshowninFig.2-14. Thisturbulent air diverted the beam and made it dance around the detector, much like a shimmering road on a hot day. The lesson here is that to work well in difficult conditions as well as good conditions, unguided optical links need to be engineered with a sufficient margin oferror.

We are surrounded 116 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 by cameras (that sense light) and displays (that emit light using LEDs and other technology). Data communication can be layered on top of these displays by en- coding information in the pattern at which LEDs turn on and off that is below the threshold of human perception. Communicating with visible light in this way is inherently safe and creates a low-speed network in the immediate vicinity of the display. This could enable all sorts of fanciful ubiquitous computing scenarios.

Unfortunately, the received signals were too weak to be of any practical use. Then the U.S. Navy noticed a kind of permanent weather balloon in the sky—the moon—and built an opera- tional systemforship-to-shore communication bybouncingsignalsoffit. Further progress inthe celestial communication field hadtowait until the first communication satellite was launched. The key difference between an artificial satellite and a real one is that the artificial one can amplify the signals before sending them back, turning a strange curiosity into a powerful communication system. Communication satellites have some interesting properties that make them attractive for many applications', 'In its simplest form, a communication satellite can be thought of as a big microwave repeater in the sky. It contains several transponders, each of which listens to some portion of the spectrum, amplifies the incoming signal, and then rebroadcasts it at another frequency to avoid inter- ference with the incoming signal. This mode of operation is known as a bent pipe. Digital processing can be added to separately manipulate or redirect data streams inthe overall band, ordigital information can even bereceivedbythesat- ellite and rebroadcast. Regenerating signals in this way improves performance compared toa bent pipe becausethe satellitedoes notamplify noiseintheupward signal. The downward beams can be broad, covering a substantial fraction of the earth’s surface,ornarrow, covering anarea onlyhundredsofkilometers indiame- ter. According toKepler’s law, the orbital period of a satellite varies as the radius of the orbit to the 3/2 power. The higher the satellite, the longer the period. Near the surface of the earth, the period is about 90 minutes. Consequently, low-orbit satellites pass out of view fairly quickly, so many of them are needed to provide continuous coverage and ground antennas must track them. At an altitude of about 35,800 km, the period is 24 hours. At an altitude of 384,000km, the period isaboutonemonth,asanyonewhohasobserved themoonregularly can testify. SEC. 2.4 COMMUNICATION SATELLITES 117 A satellite’s period is important, but it is not the only issue in determining where to place it. Another issue is the presence of the Van Allen belts, layers of highlycharged particles trapped bytheearth’s magnetic field. Anysatelliteflying within them wouldbedestroyed fairly quickly bythe particles. These factors lead to three regions in which satellites can be placed safely. These regions and some of their properties are illustrated in Fig. 2-15. Below we will briefly describe the satellitesthat inhabit eachofthese regions.

Communication satellites and some of their properties, including altitude above the earth, round-trip delay time, and number of satellitesneeded forglobalcoverage. 2.4.1 Geostationary Satellites In 1945, the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke calculated that a satellite at an altitude of 35,800 km in a circular equatorial orbit would appear to remain motionless in the sky, so it would not need to be tracked (Clarke, 1945). He went on to describe a complete communication system that used these (manned) geo- stationary satellites, including the orbits, solar panels, radio frequencies, and launch procedures. Unfortunately, he concluded that satellites were impractical due to the impossibility of putting power-hungry, fragile vacuum tube amplifiers into orbit, so he never pursued this idea further, although he wrote some science fiction stories aboutit. The invention of the transistor changed all that, and the first artificial commu- nication satellite, Telstar, was launched in July 1962. Since then, communication satellites have become a multibillion dollar business and the only aspect of outer space that has become highly profitable. These high-flying satellites are often called GEO(Geostationary Earth Orbit)satellites. 118 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP', '2 With current technology, it is unwise to have geostationary satellites spaced much closer than 2 degrees in the 360-degree equatorial plane, to avoid inter- ference. With a spacing of 2 degrees, there can only be 360/2 = 180 of these sat- ellites in the sky at once. However, each transponder can use multiple frequen- cies andpolarizations toincrease theavailable bandwidth. To prevent total chaos in the sky, orbit slot allocation is done by ITU. This process is highly political, with countries barely out of the stone age demanding ‘‘their’’ orbit slots (for the purpose of leasing them to the highest bidder). Other countries, however, maintain that national property rights do not extend up to the moonandthat nocountryhas a legal right to the orbit slots above its territory. To add to the fight, commercial telecommunication is not the only application. Tele- vision broadcasters, governments, and the military also want a piece of the orbit- ingpie. Modern satellites can be quite large, weighing over 5000 kg and consuming several kilowatts of electric power produced by the solar panels. The effects of solar, lunar, and planetary gravity tend to move them away from their assigned orbit slots and orientations, an effect countered by on-board rocket motors. This fine-tuning activity is called station keeping. However, when the fuel for the motors has been exhausted (typically after about 10 years) the satellite drifts and tumbles helplessly, so it has to be turned off. Eventually, the orbit decays and the satellitereenters theatmosphere andburnsup(orveryrarely crashes toearth). Orbit slots are not the only bone of contention. Frequencies are an issue, too, because the downlink transmissions interfere with existing microwave users. Consequently, ITU has allocated certain frequency bands to satellite users. The main ones are listed in Fig. 2-16. The C band was the first to be designated for commercial satellite traffic. Two frequency ranges are assigned in it, the lower onefordownlink traffic (fromthe satellite)andthe upperoneforuplink traffic (to the satellite). To allow traffic to go both ways at the same time, two channels are required. These channels are already overcrowded because they are also used by the common carriers for terrestrial microwave links. The L and S bands were added by international agreement in 2000. However, they are narrow and also crowded. Band Downlink Uplink Bandwidth Problems L 1.5GHz 1.6GHz 15MHz Lowbandwidth;crowded S 1.9GHz 2.2GHz 70MHz Lowbandwidth;crowded C 4.0GHz 6.0GHz 500MHz Terrestrial interference Ku 11GHz 14GHz 500MHz Rain Ka 20GHz 30GHz 3500MHz Rain,equipmentcost Figure2-16. Theprincipalsatellitebands. SEC. 2.4 COMMUNICATION SATELLITES 119 The next-highest band available to commercial telecommunication carriers is the Ku (K under) band. This band is not (yet) congested, and at its higher fre- quencies, satellitescan bespacedasclose as 1degree. However, another problem exists: rain. Water absorbs these short microwaves well. Fortunately, heavy storms are usually localized, so using several widely separated ground stations in- stead of just one circumvents the problem, but at the price of extra antennas, extra cables, and extra electronics to enable rapid switching between stations', 'Band- width has also been allocated in the Ka (K above) band for commercial satellite traffic, but the equipment needed to use it is expensive. In addition to these com- mercial bands,manygovernmentandmilitarybandsalsoexist. A modern satellite has around 40 transponders, most often with a 36-MHz bandwidth. Usually, each transponderoperates as a bent pipe, butrecent satellites have some on-board processing capacity, allowing more sophisticated operation. In the earliest satellites, the division of the transponders into channels was static: the bandwidth was simply split up into fixed frequency bands. Nowadays, each transponder beam is divided into time slots, with various users taking turns. We will study these two techniques (frequency division multiplexing and time divis- ionmultiplexing)indetail later inthischapter. The first geostationary satellites had a single spatial beam that illuminated about 1/3 of the earth’s surface, called its footprint. With the enormous decline in the price, size, and power requirements of microelectronics, a much more sophisticated broadcasting strategy has become possible. Each satellite is equipped with multiple antennas and multiple transponders. Each downward beam can be focused ona small geographical area, so multiple upward and down- ward transmissions can take placesimultaneously. Typically, these so-called spot beams are elliptically shaped, and can be as small as a few hundred kmin diame- ter. A communication satellite for the United States typically has one wide beam forthecontiguous48states, plusspotbeams forAlaska andHawaii. A recent development in the communication satellite world is the develop- ment of low-cost microstations, sometimes called VSATs (Very Small Aperture Terminals) (Abramson, 2000). These tiny terminals have 1-meter or smaller an- tennas (versus 10 m for a standard GEO antenna) and can put out about 1 watt of power. The uplink is generally good for up to 1 Mbps, but the downlink is often up to several megabits/sec. Direct broadcast satellite television uses this technol- ogyforone-way transmission. In many VSAT systems, the microstations do not have enough power to com- municate directly with one another (via the satellite, of course). Instead, a special ground station, the hub, with a large, high-gain antenna is needed to relay traffic between VSATs, as shown in Fig. 2-17. In this mode of operation, either the sender or the receiver has a large antenna and a powerful amplifier. The trade-off isalongerdelay inreturn forhavingcheaper end-user stations. VSATs have great potential in rural areas. It is not widely appreciated, but over half the world’s population lives more than hour’s walk from the nearest 120 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 Communication satellite 1 4 3 2 VSAT Hub Figure2-17. VSATsusingahub. telephone. Stringing telephone wires to thousands of small villages is far beyond the budgets of most Third World governments, but installing 1-meter VSAT dishes powered by solar cells is often feasible. VSATs provide the technology thatwillwire theworld. Communication satellites have several properties that are radically different from terrestrial point-to-point links. To begin with, even though signals to and from a satellite travel at the speed of light (nearly 300,000 km/sec), the long round-trip distance introduces a substantial delay for GEO satellites', 'Depending on the distance between the user and the ground station and the elevation of the satellite above the horizon, the end-to-end transit time is between 250 and 300 msec. Atypical value is270msec (540msec foraVSAT systemwithahub). For comparison purposes, terrestrial microwave links have a propagation delay of roughly 3μsec/km, and coaxial cable or fiber optic links have a delay of approximately 5μsec/km. The latter are slower than the former because electro- magnetic signalstravel faster inair thaninsolidmaterials. Another important property of satellites is that they are inherently broadcast media. It does not cost more to send a message to thousands of stations within a transponder’s footprint than it does to send to one. For some applications, this property is very useful. For example, one could imagine a satellite broadcasting popular Web pages to the caches of a large number of computers spread over a wide area. Even when broadcasting can be simulated with point-to-point lines, SEC. 2.4 COMMUNICATION SATELLITES 121 satellite broadcasting may be much cheaper. On the other hand, from a privacy point of view, satellites are a complete disaster: everybody can hear everything. Encryption isessential whensecurity isrequired. Satellites also have the property that the cost of transmitting a message is in- dependent of the distance traversed. A call across the ocean costs nomore to ser- vice than a call across the street. Satellites also have excellent error rates and can bedeployed almost instantly, amajor consideration fordisaster responseandmili- tary communication. 2.4.2 Medium-Earth Orbit Satellites At much lower altitudes, between the two Van Allen belts, we find the MEO (Medium-Earth Orbit) satellites. Asviewed fromthe earth, these drift slowly in longitude, taking something like 6 hours to circle the earth. Accordingly, they must be tracked as they move through the sky. Because they are lower than the GEOs, they have a smaller footprint on the ground and require less powerful transmitters to reach them. Currently they are used for navigation systems rather than telecommunications, so we will not examine them further here. The constel- lation of roughly 30 GPS (Global Positioning System) satellitesorbitingat about 20,200kmare examples ofMEOsatellites. 2.4.3 Low-Earth Orbit Satellites Moving down in altitude, we come to the LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) satellites. Due to their rapid motion, large numbers of them are needed for a complete sys- tem. Onthe other hand, becausethe satellitesare so close tothe earth, the ground stations do not need much power, and the round-trip delay is only a few millisec- onds. The launch cost is substantially cheaper too. In this section we will exam- ine two examples of satellite constellations for voice service, Iridium and Glo- balstar. For the first 30 years of the satellite era, low-orbit satellites were rarely used because they zip into and out of view so quickly. In 1990, Motorola broke new ground by filing an application with the FCC asking for permission to launch 77 low-orbit satellites for the Iridium project (element 77 is iridium). The plan was later revised to use only 66 satellites, so the project should have been renamed Dysprosium (element 66),butthat probably soundedtoomuchlikeadisease', 'The idea was that as soon as one satellite went out of view, another would replace it. This proposal set off a feeding frenzy among other communication companies. Allofasudden,everyonewanted tolaunch achain oflow-orbit satellites. After seven years of cobbling together partners and financing, communication service began in November 1998. Unfortunately, the commercial demand for large, heavy satellitetelephoneswas negligible becausethe mobile phonenetwork had grown in a spectacular way since 1990. As a consequence, Iridium was not 122 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 profitable andwas forced intobankruptcy inAugust1999inoneofthe mostspec- tacular corporate fiascos in history. The satellites and other assets (worth $5 bil- lion) were later purchased by an investor for $25 million at a kind of extraterres- trial garage sale. Other satellitebusiness ventures promptlyfollowed suit. The Iridium service restarted inMarch 2001and has been growing ever since. It provides voice, data, paging, fax, and navigation service everywhere on land, air, andsea, via hand-held devices that communicate directly with the Iridium sat- ellites. Customers include the maritime, aviation, and oil exploration industries, as well as people traveling in parts of the world lacking a telecom infrastructure (e.g., deserts, mountains,theSouthPole, andsomeThirdWorld countries). The Iridium satellites are positionedat an altitude of 750 km, in circular polar orbits. They are arranged in north-south necklaces, with one satellite every 32 degrees of latitude, as shown in Fig.2-18. Each satellite has a maximum of 48 cells (spot beams) and a capacity of 3840 channels, some of which are used for pagingandnavigation, while othersare usedfordata andvoice. Eachsatellitehas fourneighbors Figure2-18. TheIridiumsatellitesformsixnecklacesaroundtheearth. With six satellite necklaces the entire earth is covered, as suggested by Fig.2-18. An interesting property of Iridium is that communication between dis- tant customers takes place in space, as shown in Fig.2-19(a). Here we see a call- er at the North Pole contacting a satellitedirectly overhead. Each satellitehasfour neighbors with which it can communicate, two in the same necklace (shown) and two in adjacent necklaces (not shown). The satellites relay the call across this griduntilitisfinally sentdowntothecallee attheSouthPole. An alternative design to Iridium is Globalstar. It is based on 48 LEO satel- lites but uses a different switching scheme than that of Iridium. Whereas Iridium relays calls from satellite to satellite, which requires sophisticated switching equipment in the satellites, Globalstar uses a traditional bent-pipe design. The call originating at the North Pole in Fig. 2-19(b) is sent back to earth and picked SEC. 2.4 COMMUNICATION SATELLITES 123 Satelliteswitches Bent-pipe inspace satellite Switching onthe ground (a) (b) Figure2-19. (a)Relayinginspace.(b)Relayingontheground. up by the large ground station at Santa’s Workshop. The call is then routed via a terrestrial network to the ground station nearest the callee and delivered by a bent-pipe connectionas shown. The advantage of this scheme is that it puts much of the complexity on the ground, where it is easier to manage. Also, the use of large ground station antennas that can put out a powerful signal and receive a weak one means that lower-powered telephones can be used', 'After all, the tele- phone puts out only a few milliwatts of power, so the signal that gets back to the groundstation isfairly weak, evenafter havingbeenamplified bythesatellite. Satellites continue to be launched at a rate of around 20 per year, including ever-larger satellites that now weigh over 5000kilograms. Butthere are also very small satellites for the more budget-conscious organization. To make space re- search more accessible, academics from Cal Poly and Stanford got together in 1999 to define a standard for miniature satellites and an associated launcher that would greatly lower launch costs (Nugent et al., 2008). CubeSats are satellitesin units of 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm cubes, each weighing no more than 1 kilogram, that can be launched for as little as $40,000 each. The launcher flies as a sec- ondary payload on commercial space missions. It is basically a tube that takes up to three units of cubesats and uses springs to release them into orbit. Roughly 20 cubesats have launched so far, with many more in the works. Most of them com- municate withgroundstations ontheUHFandVHFbands. 2.4.4 Satellites Versus Fiber Acomparison between satellite communication and terrestrial communication is instructive. As recently as 25 years ago, acase could bemade that the future of communication lay with communication satellites. After all, the telephonesystem 124 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 had changed little in the previous 100 years and showed no signs of changing in the next 100 years. This glacial movement was caused in no small part by the regulatory environment in which the telephone companies were expected to pro- vide good voice service at reasonable prices (which they did), and in return got a guaranteed profit on their investment. For people with data to transmit, 1200-bps modems were available. That was pretty muchallthere was. The introduction of competition in 1984 in the United States and somewhat later in Europe changed all that radically. Telephone companies began replacing their long-haul networks with fiber and introduced high-bandwidth services like ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line). They also stopped their long-time practice of charging artificially high prices to long-distance users to subsidize local service. Allofasudden,terrestrial fiber connectionslookedlikethewinner. Nevertheless, communication satellites have some major niche markets that fiber does not (and, sometimes, cannot) address. First, when rapid deployment is critical, satellites win easily. A quick response is useful for military communica- tion systems in times of war and disaster response in times of peace. Following the massive December 2004 Sumatra earthquake and subsequent tsunami, for ex- ample, communications satellites were able to restore communications to first re- sponders within 24hours. This rapid response was possible because there is a de- veloped satellite service provider market in which large players, such as Intelsat with over 50 satellites, can rent out capacity pretty much anywhere it is needed. For customers served by existing satellite networks, a VSAT can be set up easily andquicklytoprovide amegabit/seclinktoelsewhere intheworld. A second niche is for communication in places where the terrestrial infra- structure is poorly developed. Many people nowadays want to communicate everywhere they go', 'Mobile phone networks cover those locations with good population density, but do not do an adequate job inother places (e.g., at sea or in the desert). Conversely, Iridium provides voice service everywhere on Earth, even at the South Pole. Terrestrial infrastructure can also be expensive to install, depending onthe terrain and necessary rights of way. Indonesia, for example, has its own satellite for domestic telephone traffic. Launching one satellite was cheaper than stringing thousands of undersea cables among the 13,677 islands in thearchipelago. A third niche is when broadcasting is essential. A message sent by satellite can be received bythousands of groundstations at once. Satellites are used todis- tribute much network TV programming to local stations for this reason. There is now a large market for satellite broadcasts of digital TV and radio directly to end users with satellite receivers in their homes and cars. All sorts of other content can be broadcast too. For example, an organization transmitting a stream of stock, bond, or commodity prices to thousands of dealers might find a satellite system tobemuchcheaper thansimulating broadcasting ontheground. In short, it looks like the mainstream communication of the future will be ter- restrial fiber optics combined with cellular radio, but for some specialized uses, SEC. 2.4 COMMUNICATION SATELLITES 125 satellites are better. However, there is one caveat that applies to all of this: economics. Although fiber offers more bandwidth, it is conceivable that terres- trial and satellite communication could compete aggressively on price. If ad- vances in technology radically cut the cost of deploying a satellite (e.g., if some future space vehicle can toss out dozens of satellites on one launch) or low-orbit satellitescatch oninabigway, itisnotcertain thatfiberwillwinallmarkets. 2.5 DIGITAL MODULATION AND MULTIPLEXING Now that we have studied the properties of wired and wireless channels, we turn our attention to the problem of sending digital information. Wires and wire- less channels carry analog signals such as continuously varying voltage, light intensity, or sound intensity. To send digital information, we must devise analog signals to represent bits. The process of converting between bits and signals that represent themiscalled digital modulation. We will start with schemes that directly convert bits into a signal. These schemes result in baseband transmission, in which the signal occupies frequen- cies from zero upto a maximum that depends on the signaling rate. It is common for wires. Then we will consider schemes that regulate the amplitude, phase, or frequency of a carrier signal to convey bits. These schemes result in passband transmission, in which the signal occupies a band of frequencies around the fre- quency of the carrier signal. It is common for wireless and optical channels for whichthesignalsmustreside inagivenfrequency band. Channels are often shared by multiple signals. After all, it is much more con- venient to use a single wire to carry several signals than to install a wire for every signal. This kind of sharing is called multiplexing. It can be accomplished in several different ways. We will present methods for time, frequency, and code di- visionmultiplexing', 'The modulation and multiplexing techniques we describe in this section are all widely used for wires, fiber, terrestrial wireless, and satellite channels. In the following sections, wewilllookatexamples ofnetworks tosee theminaction. 2.5.1 Baseband Transmission The most straightforward form of digital modulation is to use a positive volt- age to represent a 1 and a negative voltage to represent a 0. For an optical fiber, thepresence oflightmightrepresent a1andtheabsence oflightmightrepresent a 0. This scheme is called NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero). The odd name is for his- torical reasons, and simply means that the signal follows the data. An example is showninFig.2-20(b). Once sent, the NRZ signal propagates down the wire. At the other end, the receiver converts it into bits by sampling the signal at regular intervals of time. 126 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 (a)Bitstream 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 (b)Non-ReturntoZero(NRZ) (c)NRZInvert(NRZI) (d)Manchester (ClockthatisXORedwithbits) (e)Bipolarencoding (alsoAlternateMark Inversion,AMI) Figure2-20. Line codes: (a) Bits, (b) NRZ, (c) NRZI, (d) Manchester, (e) Bi- polarorAMI. Thissignal willnotlookexactly like the signal that was sent. Itwillbeattenuated and distorted by the channel and noise at the receiver. To decode the bits, the re- ceiver maps the signal samples to the closest symbols. For NRZ, a positive volt- age will be taken to indicate that a 1was sent anda negative voltage willbe taken toindicate thata0wassent. NRZ is a good starting point for our studies because it is simple, but it is sel- dom used by itself in practice. More complex schemes can convert bits to signals that better meet engineering considerations. These schemes are called line codes. Below, we describe line codes that help with bandwidth efficiency, clock recov- ery, andDCbalance. Bandwidth Efficiency With NRZ, the signal may cycle between the positive and negative levels up to every 2 bits (in the case of alternating 1s and 0s). This means that we need a bandwidth of at least B/2 Hz when the bit rate is B bits/sec. This relation comes fromthe Nyquistrate [Eq.(2-2)]. Itisafundamentallimit, sowecannotrunNRZ faster withoutusing more bandwidth. Bandwidth is often a limited resource, even for wired channels, Higher-frequency signals are increasingly attenuated, making themlessuseful, andhigher-frequencysignals alsorequire faster electronics. One strategy for using limited bandwidth more efficiently is to use more than two signaling levels. By using four voltages, for instance, we can send 2 bits at once as a single symbol. This design will work as long as the signal at the re- ceiver is sufficiently strong to distinguish the four levels. The rate at which the signal changes isthenhalf thebitrate, sotheneeded bandwidth hasbeen reduced. SEC. 2.5 DIGITAL MODULATIONANDMULTIPLEXING 127 We call the rate at which the signal changes the symbol rate to distinguish it from the bit rate. The bit rate is the symbol rate multiplied bythe number of bits per symbol. An older name for the symbol rate, particularly in the context of de- vices called telephone modems that convey digital data over telephone lines, is the baud rate. In the literature, the terms ‘‘bit rate’’ and ‘‘baud rate’’ are often usedincorrectly', 'Note that the number of signal levels does not need to be a power of two. Often it is not, with some of the levels used for protecting against errors and sim- plifyingthedesignofthereceiver. Clock Recovery For all schemes that encode bits into symbols, the receiver must know when one symbol ends and the next symbol begins to correctly decode the bits. With NRZ, inwhich thesymbolsare simplyvoltage levels, a longrunof0sor1sleaves the signal unchanged. After a while it is hard to tell the bits apart, as 15 zeros lookmuchlike16zeros unlessyouhave averyaccurateclock. Accurate clocks wouldhelp with thisproblem, butthey are an expensive solu- tion for commodity equipment. Remember, we are timing bits onlinks that run at many megabits/sec, so the clock would have to drift less than a fraction of a microsecond over the longest permitted run. This might be reasonable for slow linksorshortmessages, butitisnotageneral solution. One strategy is to send a separate clock signal to the receiver. Another clock line is no big deal for computer buses or short cables in which there are many lines in parallel, but it is wasteful for most network links since if we had another line to send a signal we could use it to send data. A clever trick here istomix the clock signal with the data signal by XORing them together so that no extra line is needed. The results are shown in Fig.2-20(d). The clock makes a clock tran- sitioninevery bittime, soit runsat twice the bit rate. When it is XORed with the 0level it makes a low-to-high transitionthatissimplytheclock. Thistransitionis a logical 0. When it is XORed with the 1level it is inverted and makes a high-to- low transition. This transition is a logical 1. This scheme is called Manchester encoding andwas usedforclassic Ethernet. The downside of Manchester encoding is that it requires twice as much band- width as NRZ because of the clock, and we have learned that bandwidth often matters. A different strategy is based on the idea that we should code the data to ensure that there are enough transitions in the signal. Consider that NRZ will have clock recovery problems only for long runs of 0s and 1s. If there are fre- quent transitions, it will be easy for the receiver to stay synchronized with the in- comingstream ofsymbols. As a step in the right direction, we can simplify the situation by coding a 1 as a transition and a 0 as no transition, or vice versa. This coding is called NRZI (Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted), a twist on NRZ. An example is shown in 128 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 Fig.2-20(c). The popular USB (Universal Serial Bus) standard for connecting computer peripherals usesNRZI. Withit,longrunsof1sdonotcause aproblem. Of course, long runs of 0s still cause a problem that we must fix. If we were the telephone company, we might simply require that the sender not transmit too many 0s. Older digital telephone lines in the U.S., called T1 lines, did in fact re- quire that no more than 15 consecutive 0s be sent for them to work correctly', 'To really fixthe problem we can break upruns of 0s bymapping small groups of bits to be transmitted so that groups with successive 0s are mapped to slightly longer patterns thatdonothave toomanyconsecutive 0s. A well-known code to do this is called 4B/5B. Every 4 bits is mapped into a5-bit pattern with a fixed translation table. The five bit patterns are chosen so that there will never be a run of more than three consecutive 0s. The mapping is shown in Fig. 2-21. This scheme adds 25% overhead, which is better than the 100% overhead of Manchester encoding. Since there are 16 input combinations and 32 output combinations, some of the output combinations are not used. Put- ting aside the combinations with too many successive 0s, there are still some codes left. As a bonus, we can use these nondatacodes to represent physical layer control signals. For example, in some uses ‘‘11111’’ represents an idle line and ‘‘11000’’represents thestart ofaframe.

An alternative approach is to make the data look random, known as scram- bling. In this case it is very likely that there will be frequent transitions. A scrambler works by XORing the data with a pseudorandom sequence before it is transmitted. This mixing will make the data as random as the pseudorandom se- quence (assuming it is independent of the pseudorandom sequence). The receiver then XORs the incoming bits with the same pseudorandom sequence to recover the real data. For this to be practical, the pseudorandom sequence must be easy to create. Itiscommonly givenastheseed toasimple randomnumber generator. Scrambling is attractive because it adds no bandwidth or time overhead. In fact, it often helps to condition the signal so that it does not have its energy in SEC. 2.5 DIGITAL MODULATIONANDMULTIPLEXING 129 dominant frequency components (caused by repetitive data patterns) that might radiate electromagnetic interference. Scrambling helps because random signals tendtobe‘‘white,’’orhave energy spread across thefrequency components. However, scrambling does not guarantee that there will be no long runs. It is possible toget unlucky occasionally.Ifthe data are thesame asthepseudorandom sequence, they will XOR to all 0s. This outcome does not generally occur with a long pseudorandom sequence that is difficult to predict. However, with a short or predictable sequence, it might be possible for malicious users to send bit patterns that cause long runs of 0s after scrambling and cause links to fail. Early versions ofthe standards for sending IP packets over SONET links in the telephone system had this defect (Malis and Simpson, 1999). It was possible for users to send cer- tain‘‘killerpackets’’thatwere guaranteed tocause problems. Balanced Signals Signals thathave as much positivevoltage as negative voltage even over short periods of time are called balanced signals. They average to zero, which means that they have no DC electrical component', 'The lack of a DC component is an advantage because some channels, such as coaxial cable or lines with transform- ers, stronglyattenuate aDCcomponentduetotheir physicalproperties. Also,one method of connecting the receiver to the channel called capacitive coupling passes only the AC portion of a signal. In either case, if we send a signal whose average isnotzero, wewaste energy astheDCcomponentwillbefilteredout. Balancing helps to provide transitions for clock recovery since there is a mix of positive and negative voltages. It also provides a simple way to calibrate re- ceivers because the average of the signal can be measured and used as a decision threshold to decode symbols. With unbalanced signals, the average may be drift away from the true decision level due to a density of 1s, for example, which wouldcause more symbolstobedecoded witherrors. A straightforward way to construct a balanced code is to use two voltage lev- els to represent a logical 1, (say +1 V or −1 V) with 0 V representing a logical zero. To send a 1, the transmitter alternates between the +1 V and −1 V levels so that they always average out. This scheme is called bipolar encoding. In tele- phone networks it is called AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion), building on old terminology in which a 1 is called a ‘‘mark’’ and a 0 is called a ‘‘space.’’ An ex- ample isgiveninFig.2-20(e). Bipolar encoding adds a voltage level to achieve balance. Alternatively we can use a mapping like 4B/5B to achieve balance (as well as transitions for clock recovery). An example of this kind of balanced code is the 8B/10B line code. It maps 8 bits of input to 10 bits of output, so it is 80% efficient, just like the 4B/5B line code. The 8 bits are split into a group of 5 bits, which is mapped to 6 bits, and a group of 3 bits, which is mapped to 4 bits. The 6-bit and 4-bit symbols are 130 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 then concatenated. Ineachgroup,some inputpatterns can be mapped to balanced output patterns that have the same number of 0s and 1s. For example, ‘‘001’’ is mapped to‘‘1001,’’which isbalanced. But there are notenough combinations for all output patterns to be balanced. For these cases, each input pattern is mapped to two output patterns. One will have an extra 1 and the alternate will have an extra 0. For example, ‘‘000’’ is mapped to both ‘‘1011’’ and its complement ‘‘0100.’’ As input bits are mapped to output bits, the encoder remembers the disparity from the previous symbol. The disparity is the total number of 0s or 1s by which the signal is out of balance. The encoder then selects either an output pattern or its alternate to reduce the disparity. With 8B/10B, the disparity will be at most 2 bits. Thus, the signal will never be far from balanced. There will also never bemorethanfiveconsecutive 1sor0s,tohelpwithclock recovery. 2.5.2 Passband Transmission Often, we want touse arange offrequencies that does notstart at zero tosend information across a channel', 'For wireless channels, it is not practical to send very low frequency signals because the size of the antenna needs to be a fraction of the signal wavelength, which becomes large. In any case, regulatory con- straints and the need to avoid interference usually dictate the choice of frequen- cies. Even for wires, placing a signal in a given frequency band is useful to let different kindsofsignalscoexist onthechannel. This kindoftransmission iscall- ed passband transmission because an arbitrary band of frequencies is used to pass thesignal. Fortunately, our fundamental results from earlier in the chapter are all in terms of bandwidth, or the width of the frequency band. The absolute frequency values donotmatter forcapacity. Thismeans that we can take a baseband signal that occupies 0toBHz and shiftit uptooccupya passband ofStoS+BHzwith- out changing the amount of information that it can carry, even though the signal will look different. To process a signal at the receiver, we can shift it back down tobaseband, where itismore convenienttodetect symbols. Digital modulation is accomplished with passband transmission by regulating or modulating a carrier signal that sits in the passband. We can modulate the am- plitude,frequency, orphase ofthe carrier signal. Each ofthese methods has a cor- responding name. In ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying), two different amplitudes are used to represent 0 and 1. An example with a nonzero and a zero level is shown inFig. 2-22(b). More than two levels can be used to represent more symb- ols. Similarly, with FSK (Frequency Shift Keying), two or more different tones are used. The example in Fig. 2-21(c) uses just two frequencies. In the simplest formofPSK (Phase Shift Keying),the carrier wave issystematically shifted 0or 180 degrees at each symbol period. Because there are two phases, it is called BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying). ‘‘Binary’’ here refers to the two symbols, not that the symbols represent 2 bits. An example is shown in Fig. 2-22(c). A SEC. 2.5 DIGITAL MODULATIONANDMULTIPLEXING 131 better scheme that uses the channel bandwidth more efficiently is to use four shifts, e.g., 45,135,225,or315degrees, totransmit 2bitsofinformation persym- bol.

(d)Phaseshiftkeying. We can combine these schemes and use more levels to transmit more bits per symbol. Only one of frequency and phase can be modulated at a time because they are related, with frequency being the rate of change of phase over time. Usually, amplitude and phase are modulated in combination. Three examples are shown in Fig.2-23. In each example, the points give the legal amplitude and phase combinations of each symbol. In Fig.2-23(a), we see equidistant dots at 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees. The phase of a dot is indicated by the angle a line from it to the origin makes with the positive x-axis. The amplitude of a dot is the distance fromtheorigin.Thisfigure isarepresentation ofQPSK. This kind of diagram is called a constellation diagram. In Fig', '2-23(b) we see a modulation scheme with a denser constellation. Sixteen combinations of amplitudes and phase are used, so the modulation scheme can be used to transmit 132 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 90 90 90 180 0 0 180 0 270 270 270 (a) (b) (c) Figure2-23. (a)QPSK.(b)QAM-16.(c)QAM-64. 4bitspersymbol. Itiscalled QAM-16,where QAMstandsforQuadrature Am- plitude Modulation. Figure 2-23(c) is a still denser modulation scheme with 64 different combinations, so 6 bits can be transmitted per symbol. It is called QAM-64. Even higher-order QAMs are used too. As you might suspect from these constellations, it is easier to build electronics to produce symbols as a com- bination of values on each axis than as a combination of amplitude and phase values. That iswhythepatterns looklikesquares rather thanconcentric circles. The constellations we have seen so far do not show how bits are assigned to symbols. When making the assignment, an important consideration is that a small burst of noise at the receiver not lead tomany bit errors. This might happen if we assigned consecutive bit values toadjacent symbols. With QAM-16, forexample, ifonesymbolstoodfor0111and the neighboringsymbol stoodfor1000,ifthe re- ceiver mistakenly picks the adjacent symbol it will cause all of the bits to be wrong. A better solution is to map bits to symbols so that adjacent symbols differ in only 1 bit position. This mapping is called a Gray code. Fig.2-24 shows a QAM-16 constellation that has been Gray coded. Now if the receiver decodes the symbol in error, it will make only a single bit error in the expected case that the decoded symbolisclose tothetransmittedsymbol. 2.5.3 Frequency Division Multiplexing The modulation schemes we have seen let us send one signal to convey bits along a wired or wireless link. However, economies of scale play an important role inhowweusenetworks. Itcostsessentially thesame amountofmoney toin- stall and maintain a high-bandwidth transmission line as a low-bandwidth line be- tween two different offices (i.e., the costs come from having to dig the trench and not from what kind of cable or fiber goes into it). Consequently, multiplexing schemes have been developed toshare lines amongmanysignals.

Gray-codedQAM-16. FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)takes advantage ofpassband trans- mission to share a channel. It divides the spectrum into frequency bands, with each user having exclusive possession of some band in which to send their signal. AM radio broadcasting illustrates FDM. The allocated spectrum is about 1 MHz, roughly 500 to 1500 kHz. Different frequencies are allocated to different logical channels (stations), each operating in a portion of the spectrum, with the interchannel separation great enoughtoprevent interference. For a more detailed example, in Fig.2-25 we show three voice-grade tele- phone channels multiplexed using FDM. Filters limit the usable bandwidth to about3100Hz per voice-grade channel. When many channels are multiplexedto- gether, 4000 Hz is allocated per channel', 'The excess is called a guard band. It keeps the channels well separated. First the voice channels are raised in frequen- cy, each bya different amount. Then they can be combined because notwochan- nels now occupy the same portion of the spectrum. Notice that even though there are gaps between the channels thanks to the guard bands, there is some overlap between adjacent channels. The overlap is there because real filters do not have ideal sharp edges. This means that a strong spike at the edge of one channel will befelt intheadjacentoneasnonthermalnoise. This scheme has been used to multiplex calls in the telephone system for many years, but multiplexing in time is now preferred instead. However, FDM continues tobeusedintelephonenetworks, aswell as cellular, terrestrial wireless, andsatellitenetworks atahigher level ofgranularity. When sending digital data, it is possible to divide the spectrum efficiently without using guard bands. In OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multi- plexing), the channel bandwidth is divided into many subcarriers that indepen- dently send data (e.g., with QAM). The subcarriers are packed tightly together in the frequency domain. Thus, signals from each subcarrier extend into adjacent ones. However, as seen in Fig.2-26, the frequency response of each subcarrier is 134 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 Channel1 1 Channel2 1 Channel3 1 300 3100 rotcafnoitaunettA Channel2 Channel1 Channel3 60 64 68 72 Frequency(kHz) (c) 60 64 68 72 Frequency(Hz) Frequency(kHz) (a) (b) Figure2-25.

The subcarriers can therefore be sampled at their center frequencies without interference from their neighbors. To make this work, a guard time is needed to repeat a portion of the symbol signals in time so that they have the desired frequency response. However, thisoverhead ismuchlessthanisneeded formanyguardbands. Power Separation OneOFDMsubcarrier(shaded) f Frequency f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 Figure2-26. Orthogonalfrequencydivisionmultiplexing(OFDM). The idea of OFDM has been around for a long time, but it is only in the last decade that it has been widely adopted, following the realization that it is possible SEC. 2.5 DIGITAL MODULATIONANDMULTIPLEXING 135 to implement OFDM efficiently in terms of a Fourier transform of digital data over all subcarriers (instead of separately modulating each subcarrier). OFDM is used in 802.11, cable networks and power line networking, and is planned for fourth-generation cellular systems. Usually, one high-rate stream of digital infor- mation is split into many low-rate streams that are transmitted on the subcarriers in parallel. This division is valuable because degradations of the channel are easi- ertocope withatthesubcarrier level; some subcarriers may bevery degraded and excluded infavorofsubcarriers thatare receivedwell. 2.5.4 Time Division Multiplexing An alternative to FDM is TDM (Time Division Multiplexing). Here, the users take turns (in around-robinfashion), eachone periodically gettingthe entire bandwidth for a little burst of time. An example of three streams being multi- plexed with TDM is shown in Fig.2-27. Bits from each input stream are taken in a fixed time slot and output to the aggregate stream. This stream runs at the sum rate of the individual streams', 'For this to work, the streams must be synchronized in time. Small intervals of guard time analogous to a frequency guard band may beadded toaccommodatesmall timingvariations. 1 Round-robin 2 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 TDM multiplexer 3 Guardtime Figure2-27. TimeDivisionMultiplexing(TDM). TDM is used widely as part of the telephone and cellular networks. To avoid one point of confusion, let us be clear that it is quite different from the alternative STDM (Statistical Time Division Multiplexing). The prefix ‘‘statistical’’ is added to indicate that the individual streams contribute to the multiplexed stream not on a fixed schedule, but according to the statistics of their demand. STDM is packet switching byanother name. 2.5.5 Code Division Multiplexing There is a third kind of multiplexing that works in a completely different way than FDM and TDM. CDM (Code Division Multiplexing) is a form of spread spectrum communication in which a narrowband signal is spread out over a wider frequency band. This can make it more tolerant of interference, as well as allowing multiple signals from different users to share the same frequency band. Because code division multiplexingismostly used forthe latter purpose it iscom- monlycalled CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access). 136 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 CDMA allows each station to transmit over the entire frequency spectrum all the time. Multiple simultaneous transmissions are separated using coding theory. Before getting into the algorithm, let us consider an analogy: an airport lounge with many pairs of people conversing. TDM is comparable to pairs of people in the room taking turns speaking. FDM is comparable to the pairs of people speak- ing at different pitches, some high-pitched and some low-pitched such that each pair can hold its own conversation at the same time as but independently of the others. CDMA is comparable to each pair of people talking at once, but in a dif- ferent language. The French-speaking couple just hones in on the French, reject- ingeverything that isnotFrench as noise. Thus,thekeytoCDMAistobeable to extract the desired signal while rejecting everything else as random noise. A somewhat simplified description ofCDMAfollows. In CDMA, each bit time is subdivided into m short intervals called chips. Typically, there are 64 or 128 chips per bit, butin the example given here we will use 8 chips/bit for simplicity. Each station is assigned a unique m-bit code called achip sequence. For pedagogical purposes, itisconvenienttouseabipolar nota- tion to write these codes as sequences of −1 and +1. We will show chip se- quences inparentheses. To transmit a 1 bit, a station sends its chip sequence. To transmit a 0 bit, it sends the negation of its chip sequence. No other patterns are permitted. Thus, for m =8, if station A is assigned the chip sequence (−1−1−1+1+1−1+1+1), it can send a 1 bit by transmiting the chip sequence and a 0 by transmitting (+1+1+1−1−1+1−1−1). It is really signals with these voltage levels that are sent, butitissufficient forustothinkinterms ofthesequences', 'Increasing the amount of information to be sent from b bits/sec to mb chips/sec for each station means that the bandwidth needed for CDMA is greater byafactor ofmthan the bandwidth needed forastation notusingCDMA (assum- ing no changes in the modulation or encoding techniques). If we have a 1-MHz bandavailable for100stations, with FDM each onewouldhave 10kHz and could send at 10kbps(assuming 1bitper Hz). With CDMA, eachstation usesthefull1 MHz, sothechiprate is100chips perbittospread thestation’s bitrate of10kbps across thechannel. In Fig.2-28(a) and (b) we show the chip sequences assigned to four example stations and the signals that they represent. Each station has its own unique chip sequence. Let us use the symbol S to indicate the m-chip vector for station S, and S for its negation. All chip sequences are pairwise orthogonal, by which we mean that the normalized inner product of any two distinct chip sequences, S and T (written as S T), is 0. It is known how to generate such orthogonal chip se- quences using a method known as Walsh codes. In mathematical terms, ortho- gonalityofthechipsequences can beexpressed asfollows: S T≡ 1 Σ m S T =0 (2-5) i i m i=1 SEC. 2.5 DIGITAL MODULATIONANDMULTIPLEXING 137 In plain English, as many pairs are the same as are different. This orthogonality property will prove crucial later. Note that if S T=0, then S T is also 0. The normalized innerproductofanychipsequence withitself is1: S S= 1 Σ m S S = 1 Σ m S2 = 1 Σ m (±1)2 =1 i i i m m m i=1 i=1 i=1 This follows because each of the m terms in the inner product is 1, so the sum is m.

(a) Chip sequences for four stations. (b) Signals the sequences represent(c)Sixexamplesoftransmissions.(d)RecoveryofstationC’ssignal. Duringeachbittime, astation can transmit a1(bysending itschip sequence), it can transmit a 0 (by sending the negative of its chip sequence), or it can be silent and transmit nothing. We assume for now that all stations are synchronized in time, so all chip sequences begin at the same instant. When two or more sta- tions transmit simultaneously, their bipolar sequences add linearly. For example, if in one chip period three stations output +1 and one station outputs −1, +2 will bereceived. One can thinkofthisassignals that addas voltages superimposed on the channel: three stations output+1Vandonestation outputs−1V,sothat2Vis received. For instance, in Fig. 2-28(c) we see six examples of one or more sta- tions transmitting 1 bit at the same time. In the first example, C transmits a 1 bit, so we just get C’s chip sequence', 'In the secondexample, both B and C transmit 1 bits,sowegetthesumoftheir bipolar chipsequences, namely: (−1−1+1−1+1+1+1−1)+(−1+1−1+1+1+1−1−1)=(−2 0 0 0+2+2 0−2) To recover the bit stream of an individual station, the receiver must know that station’s chip sequence in advance. It does the recovery by computing the nor- malized inner product of the received chip sequence and the chip sequence of the station whose bit stream it is trying to recover. If the received chip sequence is S and the receiver is trying to listen to a station whose chip sequence is C, it just computes thenormalized inner product,S C. 138 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 Tosee whythisworks,justimagine thattwostations, AandC,bothtransmit a 1 bit at the same time that B transmits a 0 bit, as is the case in the third example. The receiversees thesum,S=A+B+C,andcomputes S C=(A+B+C) C=A C+B C+C C=0+0+1=1 The first twoterms vanish because all pairs of chip sequences have been carefully chosen to be orthogonal, as shown in Eq. (2-5). Now it should be clear why this property mustbeimposed onthechipsequences. To make the decoding process more concrete, we show six examples in Fig.2-28(d). Suppose that the receiver is interested in extracting the bit sent by station C from each of the six signals S through S . It calculates the bit by sum- 1 6 ming the pairwise products of the received S and the C vector of Fig.2-28(a) and then taking 1/8 of the result (since m =8 here). The examples include cases where C is silent, sends a 1 bit, and sends a 0 bit, individually and in combination with other transmissions. As shown, the correct bit is decoded each time. It is justlikespeaking French. In principle, given enough computing capacity, the receiver can listen to all the senders at once by running the decoding algorithm for each of them in paral- lel. Inreal life, suffice ittosaythatthisiseasier said than done,andit isuseful to knowwhichsenders mightbetransmitting. Intheideal, noiseless CDMAsystemwe have studied here, the number ofsta- tions that send concurrently can be made arbitrarily large by using longer chip se- quences. For 2n stations, Walsh codes can provide 2n orthogonal chip sequences of length 2n. However, one significant limitation is that we have assumed that all the chips are synchronized in time at the receiver. This synchronization is not even approximately true insome applications, such as cellular networks (in which CDMA has been widely deployed starting in the 1990s). It leads to different de- signs. We will return to this topic later in the chapter and describe how asynchro- nousCDMAdiffers fromsynchronousCDMA. As well as cellular networks, CDMA is used by satellites and cable networks. We have glossed over many complicating factors in this brief introduction. En- gineers who want to gain a deep understanding of CDMA should read Viterbi (1995) and Lee and Miller (1998). These references require quite a bit of back- groundincommunication engineering, however. 2.6 THE PUBLIC SWITCHED TELEPHONE NETWORK When two computers owned by the same company or organization and locat- ed close to each other need to communicate, it is often easiest just to run a cable between them', 'LANs work this way. However, when the distances are large or there are many computers orthecables have topassthroughapublicroadorother public right of way, the costs of running private cables are usually prohibitive. SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 139 Furthermore, in just about every country in the world, stringing private transmis- sionlines across (or underneath) public property is also illegal. Consequently, the network designers mustrelyontheexisting telecommunication facilities. These facilities, especially the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Net- work), were usually designed many years ago, with a completely different goal in mind: transmitting the human voice in a more-or-less recognizable form. Their suitability for use in computer-computer communication is often marginal at best. Tosee thesize oftheproblem, consider thatacheap commodity cable runningbe- tween two computers can transfer data at 1 Gbps or more. In contrast, typical ADSL, the blazingly fast alternative to a telephone modem, runs at around 1 Mbps. The difference between the two is the difference between cruising in an airplane andtakingaleisurely stroll. Nonetheless, the telephone system is tightly intertwined with (wide area) computer networks, so it is worth devoting some time to study it in detail. The limiting factor for networking purposes turns out to be the ‘‘last mile’’ over which customers connect, not the trunks and switches inside the telephone network. This situation is changing with the gradual rollout of fiber and digital technology at the edge of the network, but it will take time and money. During the longwait, computer systems designers used to working with systems that give at least three orders of magnitude better performance have devoted much time and effort tofig- ureouthowtousethetelephonenetwork efficiently. Inthefollowing sections wewilldescribe the telephonesystem andshowhow it works. Foradditionalinformation aboutthe innards ofthetelephonesystemsee Bellamy (2000). 2.6.1 Structure of the Telephone System Soon after Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone in 1876 (just a few hours ahead of his rival, Elisha Gray), there was an enormous demand forhisnew invention. The initial market was for the sale of telephones, which came in pairs. It was up to the customer to string a single wire between them. If a telephone owner wanted to talk to n other telephone owners, separate wires had to be strung to all n houses. Within a year, the cities were covered with wires passing over houses and trees in a wild jumble. It became immediately obvious that the model of connecting every telephone to every other telephone, as shown in Fig. 2-29(a), was notgoingtowork. To his credit, Bell saw this problem early on and formed the Bell Telephone Company, which opened its first switching office (in New Haven, Connecticut) in 1878. The company ran a wire to each customer’s house or office. To make a call, the customer wouldcrank thephonetomake aringingsoundinthetelephone company office to attract the attention of an operator, who would then manually connect the caller to the callee by using a short jumper cable to connect the caller tothecallee. The modelofasingle switching office isillustratedinFig. 2-29(b). 140 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 (a) (b) (c) Figure2-29. (a)Fullyinterconnectednetwork. (b)Centralizedswitch. (c)Two-levelhierarchy', 'Pretty soon, Bell System switching offices were springing up everywhere and people wanted to make long-distance calls between cities, so the Bell System began to connect the switching offices. The original problem soon returned: to connect every switching office to every other switching office by means of a wire between them quickly became unmanageable, so second-level switching offices were invented. After a while, multiple second-level offices were needed, as illus- trated inFig.2-29(c). Eventually, thehierarchy grew tofivelevels. By 1890, the three major parts of the telephone system were in place: the switching offices, the wires between the customers and the switching offices (by now balanced, insulated, twisted pairs instead of open wires with an earth return), and the long-distance connections between the switching offices. For a short technical historyofthetelephonesystem, see Hawley (1991). While there have been improvements in all three areas since then, the basic Bell System model has remained essentially intact for over 100 years. The fol- lowing description is highly simplified but gives the essential flavor nevertheless. Each telephone has two copper wires coming out of it that go directly to the tele- phone company’s nearest end office (also called a local central office). The dis- tance is typically 1 to 10 km, being shorter in cities than in rural areas. In the United States alone there are about 22,000end offices. The two-wire connections between each subscriber’s telephone and the end office are known in the trade as the local loop. If the world’s local loops were stretched out end to end, they wouldextend tothemoonandback 1000times. At one time, 80% of AT&T’s capital value was the copper in the local loops. AT&T was then, in effect, the world’s largest copper mine. Fortunately, this fact was notwell known in the investment community. Had it been known, some cor- porate raider might have bought AT&T, ended all telephone service in the United States, rippedoutallthewire, andsoldittoacopperrefiner foraquickpayback. SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 141 If a subscriber attached to a given end office calls another subscriber attached to the same end office, the switching mechanism within the office sets up a direct electrical connection between the two local loops. This connection remains intact fortheduration ofthecall. If the called telephone is attached to another end office, a different procedure has to be used. Each end office has a number of outgoing lines to one or more nearby switching centers, called toll offices (or, if they are within the same local area, tandem offices). These lines are called toll connecting trunks. The num- ber of different kinds of switching centers and their topology varies from country tocountrydepending onthecountry’stelephonedensity. If both the caller’s and callee’s end offices happen to have a toll connecting trunk to the same toll office (a likely occurrence if they are relatively close by), the connection may be established within the toll office. A telephone network consisting only of telephones (the small dots), end offices (the large dots), andtoll offices (thesquares) isshowninFig. 2-29(c). Ifthecaller andcallee donothave atolloffice incommon, apath willhave to be established between two toll offices', 'The toll offices communicate with each other via high-bandwidth intertoll trunks (also called interoffice trunks). Prior to the 1984 breakup of AT&T, the U.S. telephone system used hierarchical rout- ing tofind a path, going to higher levels of the hierarchy until there was a switch- ing office in common. This was then replaced with more flexible, nonhierarchical routing. Figure 2-30showshowalong-distanceconnectionmightberouted.

Atypicalcircuitrouteforalong-distancecall. A variety of transmission media are used for telecommunication. Unlike modern office buildings, where the wiring is commonly Category 5, local loopsto homes mostly consist of Category 3 twisted pairs, with fiber just starting to appear. Between switching offices, coaxial cables, microwaves, and especially fiber optics are widely used. In the past, transmission throughout the telephone system was analog, with the actual voice signal being transmitted as an electrical voltage from source to destination. With the advent offiber optics, digital electronics, and computers, all the trunks and switches are now digital, leaving the local loop as the last piece of 142 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 analog technology in the system. Digital transmission is preferred because it is not necessary to accurately reproduce an analog waveform after it has passed through many amplifiers on a long call. Being able to correctly distinguish a 0 from a 1 is enough. This property makes digital transmission more reliable than analog. Itisalsocheaper andeasier tomaintain. Insummary, thetelephonesystem consists ofthree major components: 1. Local loops(analog twisted pairs goingtohousesandbusinesses). 2. Trunks(digital fiber opticlinksconnectingtheswitching offices). 3. Switching offices (where calls are movedfromonetrunktoanother). After a short digression on the politics of telephones, we will come back to each of these three components in some detail. The local loops provide everyone ac- cess to the whole system, so they are critical. Unfortunately, they are also the weakest linkinthe system. For the long-haultrunks,the main issue ishowtocol- lect multiple calls together and send them out over the same fiber. This calls for multiplexing, and we apply FDM and TDM to doit. Finally, there are two funda- mentally different waysofdoingswitching; wewilllookatboth. 2.6.2 The Politics of Telephones For decades prior to 1984, the Bell System provided both local and long-dis- tance service throughout mostofthe United States. Inthe 1970s,the U.S. Federal Government came to believe that this was an illegal monopoly and sued to break it up. The government won, and on January 1, 1984, AT&T was broken up into AT&T Long Lines, 23 BOCs (Bell Operating Companies), and a few other pieces. The 23 BOCs were grouped into seven regional BOCs (RBOCs) to make them economically viable. The entire nature of telecommunication in the United States was changed overnight bycourt order(notbyanact ofCongress). The exact specifications of the divestiture were described in the so-called MFJ (Modified Final Judgment), an oxymoron if ever there was one—if the judgment could be modified, it clearly was not final. This event led to increased competition, better service, and lower long-distance rates for consumers and busi- nesses', 'However, prices for local service rose as the cross subsidies from long- distance calling were eliminated and local service had to become self supporting. Manyothercountrieshave nowintroducedcompetitionalongsimilar lines. Of direct relevance to our studies is that the new competitive framework caused a keytechnical feature tobeadded tothe architecture ofthe telephonenet- work. To make it clear who could do what, the United States was divided up into 164 LATAs (Local Access and Transport Areas). Very roughly, a LATA is about as big as the area covered by one area code. Within each LATA, there was one LEC (Local Exchange Carrier) with a monopoly on traditional telephone SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 143 service within its area. The most important LECs were the BOCs, although some LATAs contained one or more of the 1500 independent telephone companies op- erating asLECs. The new feature was that all inter-LATA traffic was handled by a different kind of company, an IXC (IntereXchange Carrier). Originally, AT&T Long Lines was the only serious IXC, but now there are well-established competitors such as Verizon and Sprint in the IXC business. One of the concerns at the breakup was to ensure that all the IXCs would be treated equally in terms of line quality, tariffs, and the number of digits their customers would have to dial to use them. The way this is handled is illustrated in Fig. 2-31. Here we see three ex- ample LATAs, each with several end offices. LATAs 2 and 3 also have a small hierarchy withtandem offices (intra-LATA tolloffices).

All the circles are LECswitchingoffices. EachhexagonbelongstotheIXCwhosenumberisinit. Any IXC that wishes to handle calls originating in a LATA can build a switching office called a POP (Point of Presence) there. The LEC is required to connect each IXC to every end office, either directly, as in LATAs 1 and 3, or indirectly, as in LATA 2. Furthermore, the terms of the connection, both techni- cal and financial, must be identical for all IXCs. This requirement enables, a sub- scriber in, say, LATA 1, to choose which IXC to use for calling subscribers in LATA 3. As part of the MFJ, the IXCs were forbidden to offer local telephone service and the LECs were forbidden to offer inter-LATA telephone service, although 144 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 both were free to enter any other business, such as operating fried chicken restau- rants. In1984,thatwasafairly unambiguousstatement. Unfortunately, technolo- gy has a funny way of making the law obsolete. Neither cable television nor mo- bile phones were covered by the agreement. As cable television went from one way to two way and mobile phones exploded in popularity, both LECs and IXCs began buyingupormerging withcable andmobile operators', 'By 1995, Congress saw that trying to maintain a distinction between the vari- ous kinds of companies was no longer tenable and drafted a bill to preserve ac- cessibility for competition but allow cable TV companies, local telephone com- panies, long-distance carriers, and mobile operators to enter one another’s busi- nesses. The idea was that any company could then offer its customers a single integrated package containing cable TV, telephone, and information services and that different companies would compete on service and price. The bill was en- acted into law in February 1996 as a major overhaul of telecommunications regu- lation. As a result, some BOCs became IXCs and some other companies, such as cable television operators, began offering local telephone service in competition withtheLECs. One interesting property of the 1996 law is the requirement that LECs imple- ment local number portability. This means that a customer can change local telephone companies without having to get a new telephone number. Portability for mobile phone numbers (and between fixed and mobile lines) followed suit in 2003. These provisions removed a huge hurdle for many people, making them much more inclined to switch LECs. As a result, the U.S. telecommunications landscape became much more competitive, and other countries have followed suit. Often other countries wait to see how this kind of experiment works out in the U.S. Ifitworks well, they dothe same thing; if it works badly, they try some- thingelse. 2.6.3 The Local Loop: Modems, ADSL, and Fiber It is now time to start our detailed study of how the telephone system works. Let us begin with the part that most people are familiar with: the two-wire local loop coming from a telephone company end office into houses. The local loop is also frequently referred to as the ‘‘last mile,’’ although the length can be up to several miles. Ithas carried analog information for over 100years and is likely to continue doing so for some years to come, due to the high cost of converting to digital. Much effort has been devoted to squeezing data networking out of the copper local loops that are already deployed. Telephone modems send digital data be- tween computers over the narrow channel the telephone network provides for a voice call. They were once widely used, but have been largely displaced by broadband technologies such as ADSL that. reuse the local loop to send digital data fromacustomer totheendoffice, where theyare siphonedofftotheInternet. SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 145 Both modems and ADSL must deal with the limitations of old local loops: rel- atively narrow bandwidth, attenuation and distortion of signals, and susceptibility toelectrical noisesuchascrosstalk. In some places, the local loop has been modernized by installing optical fiber to (or very close to) the home. Fiber is the way of the future. These installations support computer networks from the ground up, with the local loop having ample bandwidth for data services. The limiting factor is what people will pay, not the physicsofthelocal loop. In this section we will study the local loop, both old and new', 'We will cover telephonemodems, ADSL, andfiber tothehome. Telephone Modems To send bits over the local loop,or any other physical channel for that matter, they must be converted to analog signals that can be transmitted over the channel. This conversion is accomplished using the methods for digital modulation that we studied in the previous section. At the other end of the channel, the analog signal isconvertedback tobits. A device that converts between a stream of digital bits and an analog signal that represents the bits is called a modem, which is short for ‘‘modulator demodu- lator.’’ Modems come in many varieties: telephone modems, DSL modems, cable modems, wireless modems, etc. The modem may be built into the computer (which is now common for telephone modems) or be a separate box (which is common for DSL and cable modems). Logically, the modem is inserted between the(digital) computer andthe(analog) telephonesystem, asseen inFig. 2-32. Computer Trunk(digital,fiber) Digitalline Localloop ISP2 (analog) Analogline Modem Codec ISP1 End office Codec Modem Figure2-32. The use of both analog and digital transmission for a computer- to-computercall.Conversionisdonebythemodemsandcodecs. Telephone modems are used to send bits between two computers over a voice-grade telephone line, in place of the conversation that usually fills the line. The main difficulty in doing so is that a voice-grade telephone line is limited to 3100 Hz, about what is sufficient to carry a conversation. This bandwidth is more than four orders of magnitude less than the bandwidth that is used for Ethernet or 146 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 802.11 (WiFi). Unsurprisingly, the data rates of telephone modems are also four orders ofmagnitude lessthanthatofEthernet and802.11. Let us run the numbers to see why this is the case. The Nyquist theorem tells us that even with a perfect 3000-Hz line (which a telephone line isdecidedly not), there is no point in sending symbols at a rate faster than 6000 baud. In practice, most modems send at a rate of 2400 symbols/sec, or 2400baud, and focus onget- ting multiple bits per symbol while allowing traffic in both directions at the same time (byusingdifferent frequencies fordifferent directions). The humble 2400-bpsmodem uses 0volts fora logical 0and 1volt for a logi- cal 1, with 1 bit per symbol. One step up, it can use four different symbols, as in thefourphases ofQPSK, sowith2bits/symbol itcan getadata rate of4800bps. A long progression of higher rates has been achieved as technology has im- proved. Higher rates require a larger set of symbols or constellation. With many symbols, even a small amount of noise in the detected amplitude or phase can re- sult in an error. To reduce the chance of errors, standards for the higher-speed modems use some of the symbols for error correction. The schemes are known as TCM (TrellisCoded Modulation)(Ungerboeck, 1987). The V.32 modem standard uses 32 constellation points to transmit 4 data bits and 1 check bit per symbol at 2400 baud to achieve 9600 bps with error cor- rection. The next step above 9600 bps is 14,400 bps', 'It is called V.32bis and transmits 6 data bits and 1 check bit per symbol at 2400 baud. Then comes V.34, which achieves 28,800 bpsbytransmitting 12data bits/symbol at 2400baud. The constellation now has thousands of points. The final modem in this series is V.34 biswhich uses14data bits/symbol at2400baudtoachieve 33,600bps. Why stop here? The reason that standard modems stop at 33,600 is that the Shannon limit for the telephone system is about 35 kbps based on the average length of local loops and the quality of these lines. Going faster than this would violate thelaws ofphysics(department ofthermodynamics). However, there is one way we can change the situation. At the telephone company end office, the data are converted to digital form for transmission within the telephone network (the core of the telephone network converted from analog to digital long ago). The 35-kbps limit is for the situation in which there are two local loops, one at each end. Each of these adds noise to the signal. If we could get rid of one of these local loops, we would increase the SNR and the maximum rate wouldbedoubled. This approach is how 56-kbps modems are made to work. One end, typically an ISP, gets a high-quality digital feed from the nearest end office. Thus, when one end of the connection is a high-quality signal, as it is with most ISPs now, the maximum data rate can be as high as 70 kbps. Between two home users with modems andanalog lines, themaximum isstill33.6kbps. The reason that 56-kbps modems (rather than 70-kbps modems) are in use has to do with the Nyquist theorem. A telephone channel is carried inside the tele- phone system as digital samples. Each telephone channel is 4000 Hz wide when SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 147 the guard bands are included. The number of samples per second needed to reconstruct it is thus 8000. The number of bits per sample in the U.S. is 8, one of which may be used for control purposes, allowing 56,000 bits/sec of user data. In Europe, all 8 bits are available to users, so 64,000-bit/sec modems could have been used,buttogetinternational agreement onastandard, 56,000was chosen. The end result is the V.90 and V.92 modem standards. They provide for a 56-kbps downstream channel (ISP to user) and a 33.6-kbps and 48-kbps upstream channel (user to ISP), respectively. The asymmetry is because there is usually more data transported from the ISP to the user than the other way. It also means that more of the limited bandwidth can be allocated to the downstream channel to increase thechances ofitactually workingat56kbps. Digital SubscriberLines When the telephone industry finally got to56kbps, it patted itself onthe back for a job well done. Meanwhile, the cable TV industry was offering speeds up to 10 Mbps on shared cables. As Internet access became an increasingly important part oftheir business, the telephonecompanies (LECs) began torealize theyneed- ed a more competitive product. Their answer was to offer new digital services overthelocal loop', 'Initially,there were manyoverlapping high-speed offerings, all underthe gen- eral name of xDSL (Digital Subscriber Line), for various x. Services with more bandwidth than standard telephone service are sometimes called broadband, al- though the term really is more of a marketing concept than a specific technical concept. Later, we will discuss what has become the most popular of these ser- vices, ADSL (Asymmetric DSL). We will also use the term DSL or xDSL as shorthandforallflavors. The reason that modems are so slow is that telephones were invented for car- rying the human voice and the entire system has been carefully optimized for this purpose. Data have always been stepchildren. At the point where each local loop terminates in the end office, the wire runs through a filter that attenuates all fre- quencies below 300Hz and above 3400 Hz. The cutoff is not sharp—300 Hz and 3400Hz are the 3-dBpoints—so the bandwidth isusually quotedas4000Hzeven thoughthedistance between the3dBpointsis3100Hz. Data onthewire are thus alsorestricted tothisnarrow band. The trick that makes xDSL work is that when a customer subscribes to it, the incoming line is connected to a different kind of switch, one that does not have thisfilter,thusmakingtheentire capacity ofthelocal loopavailable. The limiting factor then becomes the physics of the local loop, which supports roughly 1MHz, nottheartificial 3100Hzbandwidth created bythefilter. Unfortunately, the capacity of the local loop falls rather quickly with distance from the end office as the signal is increasingly degraded along the wire. It also depends on the thickness and general quality of the twisted pair. A plot of the 148 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 potential bandwidth as a function of distance is given in Fig.2-33. This figure as- sumesthatalltheother factors are optimal (new wires, modest bundles,etc.). 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 Meters spbM Figure2-33. BandwidthversusdistanceoverCategory3UTPforDSL. The implication of this figure creates a problem for the telephone company. When it picks a speed to offer, it is simultaneously picking a radius from its end offices beyond which the service cannot be offered. This means that when distant customers try to sign up for the service, they may be told ‘‘Thanks a lot for your interest, butyoulive 100meters toofar from the nearest end office toget this ser- vice. Could you please move?’’ The lower the chosen speed is, the larger the radius and the more customers are covered. But the lower the speed, the less attractive the service is and the fewer the people who will be willing to pay for it. Thisiswhere business meets technology. The xDSL services have all been designed with certain goals in mind. First, the services must work over the existing Category 3twisted pair local loops. Sec- ond,theymustnotaffect customers’ existing telephonesandfax machines. Third, they must be much faster than 56 kbps. Fourth, they should be always on, with justamonthlycharge andnoper-minute charge. Tomeet the technical goals, the available 1.1MHz spectrum onthe local loop is divided into 256 independent channels of 4312.5 Hz each. This arrangement is showninFig. 2-34', 'The OFDM scheme, which we saw in the previous section, is used to send data over these channels, though it is often called DMT (Discrete MultiTone) in the context of ADSL. Channel 0 is used for POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service). Channels 1–5 are not used, to keep the voice and data sig- nals from interfering with each other. Of the remaining 250 channels, one is used for upstream control and one is used for downstream control. The rest are avail- able foruserdata. Inprinciple, eachofthe remaining channels can be used for a full-duplex data stream, but harmonics, crosstalk, and other effects keep practical systems well SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 149 rewoP 2564-kHzChannels 0 25 1100kHz Voice Upstream Downstream Figure2-34. OperationofADSLusingdiscretemultitonemodulation. below the theoretical limit. It is up to the provider to determine how many chan- nels are used for upstream and how many for downstream. A 50/50 mix of upstream and downstream is technically possible, but most providers allocate something like 80–90% of the bandwidth to the downstream channel since most users download more data than they upload. This choice gives rise to the ‘‘A’’ in ADSL. A common split is 32 channels for upstream and the rest downstream. It isalsopossible tohave a few ofthe highest upstream channels bebidirectional for increased bandwidth, although making this optimization requires adding a special circuit tocancel echoes. The international ADSL standard, knownas G.dmt,was approved in 1999. It allows speeds of as much as 8 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream. It was superseded by a second generation in 2002, called ADSL2, with various im- provements to allow speeds of as much as 12 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps up- stream. Now we have ADSL2+, which doubles the downstream speed to 24 Mbpsbydoublingthebandwidth touse2.2MHz overthetwisted pair. However, the numbers quoted here are best-case speeds for good lines close (within 1 to 2 km) to the exchange. Few lines support these rates, and few pro- viders offer these speeds. Typically, providers offer something like 1 Mbps downstream and 256 kbps upstream (standard service), 4Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream (improved service), and 8 Mbps downstream and 2 Mbps upstream (premium service). Within each channel, QAM modulation is used at a rate of roughly 4000 symbols/sec. The line quality in each channel is constantly monitored and the data rate is adjusted by using a larger or smaller constellation, like those in Fig.2-23. Different channels may have different data rates, with upto 15bits per symbol sent on a channel with a high SNR, and down to 2, 1, or no bits per sym- bolsent onachannel withalowSNRdepending onthestandard. A typical ADSL arrangement is shown in Fig. 2-35. In this scheme, a tele- phonecompany technician mustinstall aNID(Network Interface Device)onthe customer’s premises. This small plastic box marks the end of the telephone com- pany’s property and the start of the customer’s property. Close to the NID (or sometimes combined with it) is a splitter, an analog filter that separates the 150 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 0–4000-Hz band used by POTS from the data', 'The POTS signal is routed to the existing telephone or fax machine. The data signal is routed to an ADSL modem, which uses digital signal processing to implement OFDM. Since most ADSL modems are external, the computer must be connected to them at high speed. Usually, thisisdoneusingEthernet, aUSB cable, or802.11. Voice switch Telephone Codec Splitter Telephone Splitter line NID Computer DSLAM ADSL Ethernet modem ToISP Telephonecompanyendoffice Customerpremises Figure2-35. AtypicalADSLequipmentconfiguration. At the other end of the wire, on the end office side, a corresponding splitter is installed. Here, the voice portion of the signal is filtered out and sent to the nor- mal voice switch. The signal above26kHz isrouted toa new kindofdevice call- ed a DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer), which contains the same kind of digital signal processor as the ADSL modem. Once the bits have been recovered fromthesignal, packets are formed andsentofftotheISP. This complete separation between the voice system and ADSL makes it rel- atively easy for a telephone company to deploy ADSL. All that is needed is buy- ing a DSLAM and splitter and attaching the ADSL subscribers to the splitter. Other high-bandwidth services (e.g., ISDN) require much greater changes to the existing switching equipment. One disadvantage of the design of Fig.2-35 is the need for a NID and splitter on the customer’s premises. Installing these can only be done by a telephone company technician, necessitating an expensive ‘‘truck roll’’ (i.e., sending a tech- nician to the customer’s premises). Therefore, an alternative, splitterless design, informally called G.lite, has also been standardized. It is the same as Fig.2-35 but without the customer’s splitter. The existing telephone line is used as is. The only difference is that a microfilter has to be inserted into each telephone jack SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 151 between the telephone or ADSL modem and the wire. The microfilter for the telephoneisalow-pass filtereliminating frequencies above3400Hz;the microfil- ter for the ADSL modem is a high-pass filter eliminating frequencies below 26 kHz. However, this system is not as reliable as having a splitter, so G.lite can be used only up to 1.5 Mbps (versus 8 Mbps for ADSL with a splitter). For more information aboutADSL, see Starr (2003). Fiber ToThe Home Deployed copper local loops limit the performance of ADSL and telephone modems. To let them provide faster and better network services, telephone com- panies are upgradinglocal loops at every opportunity byinstalling optical fiber all the way to houses and offices. The result is called FttH (Fiber To The Home). While FttH technologyhas been available for some time, deployments onlybegan to take off in 2005 with growth in the demand for high-speed Internet from cus- tomers used to DSL and cable who wanted to download movies. Around 4% of U.S. houses are now connected to FttH with Internet access speeds of up to 100 Mbps. Several variations ofthe form ‘‘FttX’’(where Xstands for the basement, curb, or neighborhood) exist. They are used to note that the fiber deployment may reach close to the house', 'In this case, copper (twisted pair or coaxial cable) pro- vides fast enoughspeeds over the last shortdistance. The choice ofhowfar tolay the fiber is an economic one, balancing cost with expected revenue. In any case, the point is that optical fiber has crossed the traditional barrier of the ‘‘last mile.’’ We willfocusonFttH inourdiscussion. Like the copper wires before it, the fiber local loop is passive. This means no powered equipment is required to amplify or otherwise process signals. The fiber simply carries signals between the home and the end office. This in turn reduces costandimproves reliability. Usually, the fibers from the houses are joined together so that only a single fiber reaches the end office per group of up to 100 houses. In the downstream di- rection, optical splitters divide the signal from the end office so that it reaches all the houses. Encryption is needed for security if only one house should be able to decode the signal. In the upstream direction, optical combiners merge the signals fromthehousesintoasingle signal thatisreceivedatthe endoffice. Thisarchitecture iscalled a PON (Passive Optical Network), andit isshown in Fig.2-36. It is common to use one wavelength shared between all the houses fordownstream transmission, andanother wavelength forupstream transmission. Even with the splitting, the tremendous bandwidth and low attenuation of fiber mean that PONs can provide high rates to users over distances of up to 20 km.The actual data rates and other details depend onthe type of PON. Two kinds are common. GPONs (Gigabit-capable PONs)come fromtheworldoftelecom- munications, so they are defined by an ITU standard. EPONs (Ethernet PONs) 152 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 Fiber Restof network Optical Endoffice splitter/combiner Figure2-36. PassiveopticalnetworkforFiberToTheHome. are more in tune with the world of networking, so they are defined by an IEEE standard. Both run at around a gigabit and can carry traffic for different services, including Internet, video, and voice. For example, GPONs provide 2.4 Gbps downstream and1.2or2.4Gbpsupstream. Some protocol is needed to share the capacity of the single fiber at the end office between the different houses. The downstream direction is easy. The end office can send messages toeach different house inwhatever order it likes. In the upstream direction, however, messages fromdifferent housescannotbesentatthe same time, or different signals would collide. The houses also cannot hear each other’s transmissions so they cannot listen before transmitting. The solution is that equipment at the houses requests and is granted time slots to use by equip- ment in the end office. For this to work, there is a ranging process to adjust the transmission times from the houses so that all the signals received at the end office are synchronized. The design is similar to cable modems, which we cover later in this chapter. For more information on the future of PONs, see Grobe and Elbers (2008). 2.6.4 Trunks and Multiplexing Trunksinthe telephone network are notonlymuch faster than the local loops, they are different intwoother respects. The core ofthe telephonenetwork carries digital information, not analog information; that is, bits not voice', 'This necessi- tates a conversion at the end office to digital form for transmission over the long- haul trunks. The trunks carry thousands, even millions, of calls simultaneously. This sharing is important for achieving economies of scale, since it costs essen- tially thesame amountofmoneytoinstall and maintain a high-bandwidth trunkas a low-bandwidth trunk between two switching offices. It is accomplished with versions ofTDMandFDMmultiplexing. Below we will briefly examine how voice signals are digitized so that they can be transported by the telephone network. After that, we willsee how TDM is used to carry bits on trunks, including the TDM system used for fiber optics SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 153 (SONET). Then we willturntoFDM as itisapplied tofiber optics, which iscall- edwavelength divisionmultiplexing. Digitizing Voice Signals Early in the development of the telephone network, the core handled voice calls as analog information. FDM techniques were used for many years to multi- plex 4000-Hz voice channels (comprised of 3100Hz plus guard bands) into larger and larger units. For example, 12 calls in the 60 kHz–to–108 kHz band is known as a group and five groups (a total of 60 calls) are known as a supergroup, and so on. These FDM methods are still used over some copper wires and microwave channels. However, FDM requires analog circuitry and is not amenable to being done by a computer. In contrast, TDM can be handled entirely by digital elec- tronics, so it has become far more widespread in recent years. Since TDM can only be used for digital data and the local loops produce analog signals, a conver- sion is needed from analog to digital in the end office, where all the individual local loopscome together tobecombined ontooutgoingtrunks. The analog signals are digitized in the end office by a device called a codec (short for ‘‘coder-decoder’’). The codec makes 8000 samples per second (125 μsec/sample) becausetheNyquisttheorem saysthatthis issufficient tocapture all the information from the 4-kHz telephone channel bandwidth. At a lower sam- pling rate, information would be lost; at a higher one, no extra information would be gained. Each sample of the amplitude of the signal is quantized to an 8-bit number. This technique is called PCM (Pulse Code Modulation). It forms the heart of the modern telephone system. As a consequence, virtually all time intervals within the telephone system are multiples of 125 μsec. The standard uncompressed data rate for a voice-grade telephone call is thus 8 bits every 125 μsec, or64kbps. At the other end of the call, an analog signal is recreated from the quantized samples by playing them out (and smoothing them) over time. It will not be ex- actly the same as the original analog signal, even though we sampled at the Nyquist rate, because the samples were quantized. To reduce the error due to quantization, the quantization levels are unevenly spaced. A logarithmic scale is used that gives relatively more bits to smaller signal amplitudes and relatively fewer bits to large signal amplitudes. In this way the error is proportional to the signal amplitude', 'Two versions of quantization are widely used: μ-law, used in North America andJapan, and A-law,used inEurope and the rest oftheworld. Bothversions are specified instandard ITU G.711. An equivalent way tothink about this process is to imagine that the dynamic range of the signal (or the ratio between the largest and smallest possible values) is compressed before it is (evenly) quantized, and then expanded when the analog signal is recreated. For this reason it is called 154 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 companding. It is also possible to compress the samples after they are digitized so that they require much less than 64kbps. However, we willleave thistopic for whenweexplore audioapplications suchasvoice overIP. Time Division Multiplexing TDM based onPCM is used tocarry multiple voice calls over trunksbysend- ing a sample from each call every 125 μsec. When digital transmission began emerging as a feasible technology, ITU (then called CCITT) was unable to reach agreement on an international standard for PCM. Consequently, a variety of incompatible schemes are nowinuseindifferent countriesaroundtheworld. The method used in North America and Japan is the T1 carrier, depicted in Fig.2-37. (Technically speaking, the format is called DS1 and the carrier is call- ed T1, but following widespread industry tradition, we will not make that subtle distinction here.) The T1 carrier consists of 24 voice channels multiplexed toget- her.

This gives a gross data rate of 1.544 Mbps, of which8kbpsisforsignaling. The 193rdbitisusedforframe synchronization and signaling. In one variation, the 193rd bit is used across a groupof 24frames call- ed an extended superframe. Six of the bits, in the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and 24th positions, take onthe alternating pattern 001011.... Normally, the receiver keeps checking for this pattern to make sure that it has not lost synchronization. Six more bits are used to send an error check code to help the receiver confirm that itissynchronized. Ifit does get outofsync, the receivercan scan for the pat- tern and validate the error check code to get resynchronized. The remaining 12 SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 155 bits are used for control information for operating and maintaining the network, suchasperformance reporting fromtheremote end. The T1 format has several variations. The earlier versions sent signaling information in-band, meaning in the same channel as the data, by using some of the data bits. This design is one form of channel-associated signaling, because each channel has its own private signaling subchannel. In one arrangement, the least significant bit out of an 8-bit sample on each channel is used in every sixth frame. It has the colorful name of robbed-bit signaling. The idea is that a few stolen bitswillnotmatter forvoice calls. Noonewillhear thedifference. For data, however, it is another story. Delivering the wrong bits is unhelpful, to say the least', 'If older versions of T1 are used to carry data, only 7 of 8 bits, or 56 kbps can be used in each of the 24 channels. Instead, newer versions of T1 provide clear channels in which all of the bits may be used to send data. Clear channels are what businesses wholease aT1linewantwhentheysend data across the telephone network in place of voice samples. Signaling for any voice calls is then handled out-of-band, meaning in a separate channel from the data. Often, the signaling is done with common-channel signaling in which there is a shared signaling channel. Oneofthe24channels maybeusedforthispurpose. Outside North America and Japan, the 2.048-Mbps E1 carrier is used instead of T1. This carrier has 32 8-bit data samples packed into the basic 125-μsec frame. Thirty of the channels are used for information and up to two are used for signaling. Each group of four frames provides 64signaling bits, half of which are used for signaling (whether channel-associated or common-channel) and half of which are used for frame synchronization or are reserved for each country to use asitwishes. Time division multiplexing allows multiple T1 carriers to be multiplexed into higher-order carriers. Figure 2-38showshowthiscan bedone. Atthe left we see four T1 channels being multiplexed into one T2 channel. The multiplexing at T2 and above is done bit for bit, rather than byte for byte with the 24 voice channels that make up a T1 frame. Four T1 streams at 1.544 Mbps should generate 6.176 Mbps, but T2 is actually 6.312 Mbps. The extra bits are used for framing and re- covery incase the carrier slips. T1 andT3are widely used bycustomers, whereas T2 and T4 are only used within the telephone system itself, so they are not well known. Atthenextlevel, seven T2streams are combined bitwise toform aT3stream. Then six T3 streams are joined to form a T4 stream. At each step a small amount of overhead is added for framing and recovery in case the synchronization be- tween sender andreceiverislost. Just as there is little agreement on the basic carrier between the United States and the rest of the world, there is equally little agreement on how it is to be multi- plexed into higher-bandwidth carriers. The U.S. scheme of stepping up by 4, 7, and 6 did not strike everyone else as the way to go, so the ITU standard calls for multiplexing four streams into one stream at each level.

The ITU hierarchy for 32, 128, 512, 2048, and 8192 channels runs at speeds of 2.048, 8.848, 34.304, 139.264,and565.148Mbps. SONET/SDH In the early days of fiber optics, every telephone company had its own proprietary optical TDM system. After AT&T was broken up in 1984, local tele- phone companies had to connect to multiple long-distance carriers, all with dif- ferent optical TDM systems, so the need for standardization became obvious', 'In 1985, Bellcore, the RBOC’s research arm, began working on a standard, called SONET (Synchronous Optical NETwork). Later, ITU joined the effort, which resulted in a SONET standard and a set of parallel ITU recommendations (G.707, G.708, and G.709) in 1989. The ITU recommendations are called SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) but differ fromSONET onlyinminorways. Virtually all the long-distancetelephonetraffic in the United States, and much of it elsewhere, now uses trunks running SONET in the physical layer. For additional information about SONET, see Bellamy (2000),Goralski (2002),andShepard (2001). The SONET design had four major goals. First and foremost, SONET had to make it possible for different carriers to interwork. Achieving this goal required defining a common signaling standard with respect to wavelength, timing, fram- ingstructure, andother issues. Second, some means was needed to unify the U.S., European, and Japanese digital systems, all of which were based on 64-kbps PCM channels but combined themindifferent (andincompatible) ways. Third, SONET had to provide a way to multiplex multiple digital channels. At the time SONET was devised, the highest-speed digital carrier actually used widely intheUnited States wasT3,at44.736Mbps. T4was defined, butnotused SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 157 much, and nothing was even defined above T4 speed. Part of SONET’s mission was tocontinue the hierarchy to gigabits/sec and beyond. A standard way to mul- tiplex slower channels intooneSONET channel was alsoneeded. Fourth, SONET had to provide support for operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM), which are needed tomanage the network. Previous systems didnotdothisverywell. An early decision was to make SONET a traditional TDM system, with the entire bandwidth of the fiber devoted to one channel containing time slots for the varioussubchannels. Assuch, SONET isa synchronoussystem. Each sender and receiver is tied to a common clock. The master clock that controls the system has anaccuracyof about1part in109. Bits ona SONET line are sent out at extreme- lyprecise intervals, controlled bythemaster clock. The basic SONET frame is a block of 810 bytes put out every 125 μsec. Since SONET is synchronous, frames are emitted whether or not there are any useful data to send. Having 8000frames/sec exactly matches the sampling rate of thePCM channels usedinalldigital telephonysystems. The 810-byte SONET frames are best described as a rectangle of bytes, 90 columns wide by 9 rows high. Thus, 8×810=6480 bits are transmitted 8000 times per second, for a gross data rate of 51.84 Mbps. This layout is the basic SONET channel, called STS-1 (Synchronous Transport Signal-1). All SONET trunksare multiplesofSTS-1. The first three columns of each frame are reserved for system management information, as illustrated in Fig. 2-39. In this block, the first three rows contain thesection overhead; thenextsixcontain thelineoverhead. The section overhead is generated and checked at the start and end of each section, whereas the line overhead isgenerated andchecked atthestart andendofeachline. A SONET transmitter sends back-to-back 810-byte frames, without gaps be- tween them, even when there are no data (in which case it sends dummy data)', 'From the receiver’s point of view, all it sees is a continuous bit stream, so how does it know where each frame begins? The answer is that the first 2 bytes of each frame contain a fixed pattern that the receiver searches for. If it finds this pattern in the same place in a large number of consecutive frames, it assumes that it is in sync with the sender. In theory, a user could insert this pattern into the payload ina regular way, but inpractice it cannot be done due to the multiplexing ofmultipleusersintothe same frame andotherreasons. The remaining 87 columns of each frame hold 87×9×8×8000=50.112 Mbps of user data. This user data could be voice samples, T1 and other carriers swallowed whole, or packets. SONET is simply a convenient container for tran- sporting bits. The SPE (Synchronous Payload Envelope), whichcarries theuser data does not always begin in row 1, column 4. The SPE can begin anywhere within theframe. Apointer tothefirstbyteiscontained inthefirst rowoftheline overhead. The first column of the SPE is the path overhead (i.e., the header for theend-to-end pathsublayer protocol). 158 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 3Columns foroverhead 87Columns Sonet 9 ... frame Rows (125μsec) Sonet ... frame (125μsec) Section Line Path SPE overhead overhead overhead Figure2-39. Twoback-to-backSONETframes. The ability to allow the SPE to begin anywhere within the SONET frame and even to span two frames, as shown in Fig.2-39, gives added flexibility to the sys- tem. For example, if a payload arrives at the source while a dummy SONET frame is being constructed, it can be inserted into the current frame instead of beinghelduntilthestart ofthenextone. The SONET/SDH multiplexing hierarchy is shown in Fig. 2-40. Rates from STS-1 to STS-768 have been defined, ranging from roughly a T3 line to 40 Gbps. Even higher rates will surely be defined over time, with OC-3072 at 160 Gbps being the next in line if and when it becomes technologically feasible. The opti- cal carrier correspondingtoSTS-niscalled OC-nbutisbitforbit the same except for a certain bit reordering needed for synchronization. The SDH names are dif- ferent, and they start at OC-3 because ITU-based systems do not have a rate near 51.84 Mbps. We have shown the common rates, which proceed from OC-3 in multiples of four. The gross data rate includes all the overhead. The SPE data rate excludes the line and section overhead. The user data rate excludes all over- head andcountsonlythe87payload columns. As an aside, when a carrier, such as OC-3, is not multiplexed, but carries the data from only a single source, the letter c (for concatenated) is appended to the designation, so OC-3 indicates a 155.52-Mbps carrier consisting of three separate OC-1 carriers, but OC-3c indicates a data stream from a single source at 155.52 Mbps. The three OC-1 streams within an OC-3c stream are interleaved by column—first column 1fromstream 1,then column 1fromstream 2,thencolumn 1 from stream 3, followed by column 2 from stream 1, and so on—leading to a frame 270columnswide and9rowsdeep.

SONETandSDHmultiplexrates. Wavelength Division Multiplexing A form of frequency division multiplexing is used as well as TDM to harness the tremendous bandwidth of fiber optic channels. It is called WDM (Wave- length Division Multiplexing). The basic principle of WDM on fibers is dep- icted in Fig. 2-41. Here four fibers come together at an optical combiner, each with its energy present at a different wavelength. The four beams are combined onto a single shared fiber for transmission to a distant destination. At the far end, thebeam issplitupover as many fibers as there were onthe inputside. Each out- put fiber contains a short, specially constructed core that filters out all but one wavelength. The resulting signals can be routed to their destination or recombin- edindifferent waysforadditionalmultiplexedtransport. There is really nothing new here. This way of operating is just frequency di- vision multiplexing at very high frequencies, with the term WDM owing to the description of fiber optic channels by their wavelength or ‘‘color’’ rather than fre- quency. As long as each channel has its own frequency (i.e., wavelength) range and all the ranges are disjoint, they can be multiplexed together on the long-haul fiber. The only difference with electrical FDM is that an optical system using a diffractiongrating iscompletely passive andthushighlyreliable. The reason WDM is popular is that the energy ona single channel is typically onlyafew gigahertz widebecausethat isthecurrent limit ofhowfastwecan con- vert between electrical and optical signals. By running many channels in parallel on different wavelengths, the aggregate bandwidth is increased linearly with the number of channels. Since the bandwidth of a single fiber band is about 25,000 GHz (see Fig. 2-7), there is theoretically room for 2500 10-Gbps channels even at 1bit/Hz(andhigher rates are also possible). WDM technology has been progressing at a rate that puts computer technolo- gy to shame. WDM was invented around 1990. The first commercial systems had eight channels of 2.5 Gbps per channel. By 1998, systems with 40 channels 160 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 Spectrum onthe sharedfiber rewoP Fiber4 spectrum λ rewoP Fiber3 spectrum λ rewoP Fiber2 spectrum λ rewoP Fiber1 spectrum λ λ 1 λ +λ +λ +λ 1 2 3 4 rewoP λ Filter Fiber1 λ 2 λ Fiber2 2 λ 4 λ Combiner Splitter Fiber3 3 λ 1 λ Long-haulsharedfiber Fiber4 4 λ 3 Figure2-41. Wavelengthdivisionmultiplexing. of 2.5 Gbps were on the market. By 2006, there were products with 192 channels of 10 Gbps and 64channels of 40Gbps, capable of moving upto 2.56 Tbps. This bandwidth is enough to transmit 80 full-length DVD movies per second. The channels are also packed tightly on the fiber, with 200, 100, or as little as 50GHz of separation', 'Technology demonstrations by companies after bragging rights have shown 10 times this capacity in the lab, but going from the lab to the field usually takes at least a few years. When the number of channels is very large and the wavelengths are spaced close together, the system is referred to as DWDM (Dense WDM). One ofthe drivers ofWDM technologyisthe development ofall-optical com- ponents. Previously, every 100 km it was necessary to split up all the channels and convert each one to an electrical signal for amplification separately before reconverting them to optical signals and combining them. Nowadays, all-optical amplifiers can regenerate the entire signal once every 1000 km without the need formultipleopto-electrical conversions. In the example of Fig.2-41, we have a fixed-wavelength system. Bits from input fiber 1 go to output fiber 3, bits from input fiber 2 go to output fiber 1, etc. However, it is also possible to build WDM systems that are switched in the opti- cal domain. In such a device, the output filters are tunable using Fabry-Perot or Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These devices allow the selected frequencies to be changed dynamically by a control computer. This ability provides a large amount of flexibility to provision many different wavelength paths through the telephone network from a fixed set of fibers. For more information about optical networks andWDM, see Ramaswami etal. (2009). SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 161 2.6.5 Switching Fromthepoint ofview ofthe average telephoneengineer, the phonesystem is divided into two principal parts: outside plant (the local loops and trunks, since they are physically outside the switching offices) and inside plant (the switches, which are inside the switching offices). We have just looked at the outside plant. Nowitistime toexamine theinside plant. Two different switching techniques are used bythe network nowadays: circuit switching and packet switching. The traditional telephone system is based on cir- cuit switching, but packet switching is beginning to make inroads with the rise of voice over IP technology. We will go into circuit switching in some detail and contrast it with packet switching. Both kinds of switching are important enough thatwewillcome back tothemwhenwegettothenetwork layer. Circuit Switching Conceptually, when you or your computer places a telephone call, the switch- ing equipment within the telephone system seeks out a physical path all the way from your telephone to the receiver’s telephone. This technique is called circuit switching. It is shown schematically in Fig. 2-42(a). Each of the six rectangles represents acarrier switching office (end office, toll office, etc.). In this example, each office has three incoming lines and three outgoing lines. When a call passes through a switching office, a physical connection is (conceptually) established be- tween the line on which the call came in and one of the output lines, as shown by thedottedlines. In the early days of the telephone, the connection was made by the operator plugginga jumper cable into the inputand outputsockets. Infact, a surprising lit- tlestoryisassociated withtheinvention ofautomatic circuit switching equipment. Itwas invented bya 19th-century Missouri undertakernamed AlmonB.Strowger', 'Shortlyafter thetelephonewasinvented, whensomeone died,oneofthe survivors would call the town operator and say ‘‘Please connect me to an undertaker.’’ Un- fortunately for Mr. Strowger, there were two undertakers in his town, and the other one’s wife was the town telephone operator. He quickly saw that either he was going to have to invent automatic telephone switching equipment or he was going to go out of business. He chose the first option. For nearly 100 years, the circuit-switching equipment used worldwide was known as Strowger gear. (His- tory does not record whether the now-unemployed switchboard operator got a job as an information operator, answering questions such as ‘‘What is the phone num- berofanundertaker?’’) The model showninFig.2-42(a) is highly simplified, of course, because parts of the physical path between the two telephones may, in fact, be microwave or fiber links onto which thousands of calls are multiplexed. Nevertheless, the basic idea is valid: once a call has been set up, a dedicated path between both ends exists andwillcontinue toexist untilthecall isfinished. 162 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 Physical(copper) connectionsetup whencallismade (a) Switchingoffice Computer Packetsqueued forsubsequent transmission Computer (b) Figure2-42. (a)Circuitswitching.(b)Packetswitching. An important property of circuit switching is the need to set up an end-to-end path before anydata can besent. Theelapsed time between theendofdialingand the start of ringing can easily be 10 sec, more on long-distance or international calls. During this time interval, the telephone system is hunting for a path, as shown inFig. 2-43(a). Note that before data transmission can even begin, the call request signal must propagate all the way to the destination andbe acknowledged. For many computer applications (e.g., point-of-sale credit verification), longsetup times are undesirable. As a consequence of the reserved path between the calling parties, once the setup has been completed, the only delay for data is the propagation time for the electromagnetic signal, about 5 msec per 1000 km. Also as a consequence of the established path, there is no danger of congestion—that is, once the call has been put through, you never get busy signals. Of course, you might get one before the connectionhasbeen established duetolack ofswitching ortrunkcapacity. Packet Switching The alternative to circuit switching is packet switching, shown in Fig. 2- 42(b) and described in Chap. 1. With this technology, packets are sent as soon as they are available. There is no need to set up a dedicated path in advance, unlike SEC. 2.6 THEPUBLICSWITCHED TELEPHONENETWORK 163 Callrequestsignal Pkt1 Propagation Pkt2 delay Pkt1 Queuing Pkt3 delay Pkt2 Pkt1 Pkt3 Time Pkt2 spent hunting Pkt3 foran outgoing Call trunk accept signal Data AB BC CD trunk trunk trunk A B C D A B C D (a) (b) emiT Figure2-43. Timingofeventsin(a)circuitswitching,(b)packetswitching. with circuit switching. It is up to routers to use store-and-forward transmission to send each packet on its way to the destination on its own. This procedure is unlike circuit switching, inwhich the result of the connection setup is the reserva- tion of bandwidth all the way from the sender to the receiver. All data on the cir- cuit follows this path', 'Among other properties, having all the data follow the same path means that it cannot arrive out of order. With packet switching there is no fixed path, so different packets can follow different paths, depending on net- workconditionsatthetime theyare sent, andtheymayarrive outoforder. Packet-switching networks place a tight upper limit on the size of packets. This ensures that nousercan monopolizeanytransmission lineforverylong(e.g., many milliseconds), so that packet-switched networks can handle interactive traf- fic. It also reduces delay since the first packet of a long message can be for- warded before the second one has fully arrived. However, the store-and-forward delay of accumulating a packet in the router’s memory before it is sent on to the 164 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 next router exceeds that of circuit switching. With circuit switching, the bits just flowthroughthewire continuously. Packet and circuit switching also differ in other ways. Because no bandwidth is reserved with packet switching, packets may have to wait to be forwarded. This introduces queuing delay and congestion if many packets are sent at the same time. On the other hand, there is no danger of getting a busy signal and being unable to use the network. Thus, congestion occurs at different times with circuit switching (at setuptime) andpacket switching (when packets are sent). If a circuit has been reserved for a particular user and there is no traffic, its bandwidth is wasted. It cannot be used for other traffic. Packet switching does notwaste bandwidth andthusismore efficient fromasystem perspective. Under- standing this trade-off is crucial for comprehending the difference between circuit switching and packet switching. The trade-off is between guaranteed service and wasting resources versusnotguaranteeing service andnotwasting resources. Packet switching is more fault tolerant than circuit switching. In fact, that is why it was invented. If a switch goes down, all of the circuits using it are termi- nated and no more traffic can be sent on any of them. With packet switching, packets can beroutedarounddead switches. A final difference between circuit and packet switching is the charging algo- rithm. With circuit switching, charging has historically been based on distance and time. For mobile phones, distance usually does not play a role, except for in- ternational calls, and time plays only a coarse role (e.g., a calling plan with 2000 free minutes costs more than one with 1000 free minutes and sometimes nights or weekends are cheap). With packet switching, connecttime is notanissue, butthe volume of traffic is. For home users, ISPs usually charge a flat monthly rate be- cause it is less work for them and their customers can understand this model, but backbonecarriers charge regional networks based onthevolumeoftheir traffic. The differences are summarized in Fig.2-44. Traditionally, telephone net- works have used circuit switching to provide high-quality telephone calls, and computer networks have used packet switching for simplicity and efficiency. However, there are notable exceptions. Some older computer networks have been circuit switched under the covers (e.g., X.25) and some newer telephone networks use packet switching with voice over IP technology', 'This looks just like a stan- dardtelephonecall ontheoutside tousers, butinside the network packets ofvoice data are switched.

Consequently, there is a tremendous amount of interest in wireless telephony. Inthefollowing sections wewillstudythistopicinsomedetail. The mobile phone system is used for wide area voice and data communica- tion. Mobile phones (sometimes called cell phones) have gone through three distinct generations, widely called 1G,2G,and3G. The generations are: 1. Analogvoice. 2. Digital voice. 3. Digital voice anddata (Internet, email, etc.). (Mobile phones should not be confused with cordless phones that consist of a base station and a handset sold as a set for use within the home. These are never usedfornetworking, sowewillnotexamine themfurther.) Although most of our discussion will be about the technology of these sys- tems, it is interesting to note how political and tiny marketing decisions can have a huge impact. The first mobile system was devised in the U.S. by AT&T and mandated for the whole country by the FCC. As a result, the entire U.S. had a single (analog) system and a mobile phone purchased inCalifornia also worked in New York. In contrast, when mobile phones came to Europe, every country de- viseditsownsystem, which resulted inafiasco. Europe learned from its mistake and when digital came around, the govern- ment-run PTTs got together and standardized on a single system (GSM), so any European mobile phone will work anywhere in Europe. By then, the U.S. had de- cided that governmentshouldnotbe inthe standardization business, soitleft digi- tal to the marketplace. This decision resulted in different equipment manufact- urers producing different kinds of mobile phones. As a consequence, in the U.S. 166 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 two major—and completely incompatible—digital mobile phone systems were deployed, aswell asother minorsystems. Despite an initial lead by the U.S., mobile phone ownership and usage in Europe isnowfar greater than inthe U.S. Having asingle systemthatworksany- where in Europe and with any provider is part of the reason, but there is more. A second area where the U.S. and Europe differed is in the humble matter of phone numbers. IntheU.S., mobilephonesare mixed inwithregular (fixed) telephones. Thus, there is no way for a caller to see if, say, (212) 234-5678 is a fixed tele- phone (cheap or free call) or a mobile phone (expensive call)', 'To keep people from getting nervous about placing calls, the telephone companies decided to make the mobile phone owner pay for incoming calls. As a consequence, many people hesitated buyingamobile phoneforfear ofrunningupa bigbillbyjust re- ceiving calls. In Europe, mobile phone numbers have a special area code (analo- gous to 800 and 900 numbers) so they are instantly recognizable. Consequently, theusual ruleof‘‘caller pays’’alsoapplies tomobile phonesinEurope (except for international calls, where costsare split). A third issue that has had a large impact on adoption is the widespread use of prepaid mobile phones in Europe (up to 75% in some areas). These can be pur- chased in many stores with no more formality than buying a digital camera. You pay and you go. They are preloaded with a balance of, for example, 20 or 50 euros and can be recharged (using a secret PIN code) when the balance drops to zero. As a consequence, practically every teenager and many small children in Europe have (usually prepaid) mobile phones so their parents can locate them, withoutthe danger ofthe child runningupahugebill. Ifthemobilephoneisused only occasionally, its use is essentially free since there is no monthly charge or charge forincoming calls. 2.7.1 First-Generation (1G) Mobile Phones: Analog Voice Enough about the politics and marketing aspects of mobile phones. Now let us look at the technology, starting with the earliest system. Mobile radiotele- phones were used sporadically for maritime and military communication during the early decades of the 20th century. In 1946, the first system for car-based tele- phones was set upin St. Louis. This system used a single large transmitter on top of a tall building and had a single channel, used for both sending and receiving. To talk, the user had to push a button that enabled the transmitter and disabled the receiver. Such systems, known as push-to-talk systems,were installed inseveral cities beginning in the late 1950s. CB radio, taxis, and police cars often use this technology. In the 1960s, IMTS (Improved Mobile Telephone System) was installed. It, too, used a high-powered (200-watt) transmitter on top of a hill but it had two frequencies, one for sending and one for receiving, so the push-to-talk button was SEC. 2.7 THEMOBILETELEPHONESYSTEM 167 no longer needed. Since all communication from the mobile telephones went inbound on a different channel than the outbound signals, the mobile users could nothear eachother (unlike thepush-to-talk system usedintaxis). IMTS supported 23 channels spread out from 150 MHz to 450 MHz. Due to the small number of channels, users often had to wait a long time before getting a dial tone. Also, due to the large power of the hilltop transmitters, adjacent sys- tems had to be several hundred kilometers apart to avoid interference. All in all, thelimited capacity made thesystem impractical. Advanced Mobile Phone System All that changed with AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System), invented by Bell Labs and first installed in the United States in 1982. It was also used in England, where it was called TACS, and in Japan, where it was called MCS-L1', 'AMPS was formally retired in 2008, but we will look at it to understand the con- textforthe2Gand3Gsystems thatimproved onit. In all mobile phone systems, a geographic region is divided up into cells, which is why the devices are sometimes called cell phones. In AMPS, the cells are typically 10 to 20 km across; in digital systems, the cells are smaller. Each cell uses some set of frequencies not used by any of its neighbors. The key idea that gives cellular systems far more capacity than previous systems is the use of relatively small cells and the reuse of transmission frequencies in nearby (but not adjacent) cells. Whereas an IMTS system 100 km across can have only one call oneach frequency, an AMPS system might have 10010-kmcells inthe same area and be able to have 10 to 15 calls on each frequency, in widely separated cells. Thus, the cellular design increases the system capacity by at least an order of magnitude, more as the cells get smaller. Furthermore, smaller cells mean that less power is needed, which leads to smaller and cheaper transmitters and handsets. The idea of frequency reuse is illustrated in Fig. 2-45(a). The cells are nor- mally roughly circular, but they are easier to model as hexagons. In Fig. 2-45(a), the cells are all the same size. They are grouped in units of seven cells. Each letter indicates a groupof frequencies. Notice that for each frequency set, there is a buffer about two cells wide where that frequency is not reused, providing for goodseparation andlowinterference. Finding locations high in the air to place base station antennas is a major issue. This problem has led some telecommunication carriers to forge alliances with the Roman Catholic Church, since the latter owns a substantial number of exalted potential antenna sites worldwide, all conveniently under a single man- agement. Inanarea where the number of users has grown tothe point that the system is overloaded, the power can be reduced and the overloaded cells split into smaller 168 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 B B G C G C A A F D F D E E B G C A F D E (a) (b) Figure2-45. (a) Frequencies are notreused inadjacentcells. (b) Toaddmore users,smallercellscanbeused. microcells to permit more frequency reuse, as shown in Fig.2-45(b). Telephone companies sometimes create temporary microcells, using portable towers with satellite links at sporting events, rock concerts, and other places where large num- bersofmobileusers congregateforafew hours. At the center of each cell is a base station to which all the telephones in the cell transmit. The base station consists of a computer and transmitter/receiver connected to an antenna. In a small system, all the base stations are connected to a single device called an MSC (Mobile Switching Center) or MTSO (Mobile Telephone Switching Office). In a larger one, several MSCs may be needed, all of which are connected to a second-level MSC, and so on. The MSCs are essen- tially end offices as in the telephone system, and are in fact connected to at least one telephone system end office', 'The MSCs communicate with the base stations, eachother,andthePSTN usingapacket-switching network. At any instant, each mobile telephone is logically in one specific cell and un- der the control of that cell’s base station. When a mobile telephone physically leaves a cell, its base station notices the telephone’s signal fading away and asks all the surrounding base stations how much power they are getting from it. When the answers come back, the base station then transfers ownership to the cell get- ting the strongest signal; under most conditions that is the cell where the tele- phone is now located. The telephone is then informed of its new boss, and if a call is in progress, it is asked to switch to a new channel (because the old one is not reused inany of the adjacent cells). This process, called handoff, takes about 300 msec. Channel assignment is done by the MSC, the nerve center of the sys- tem. Thebase stations are really justdumbradio relays. SEC. 2.7 THEMOBILETELEPHONESYSTEM 169 Channels AMPS uses FDM to separate the channels. The system uses 832 full-duplex channels, each consisting of a pair of simplex channels. This arrangement is known as FDD (Frequency Division Duplex). The 832 simplex channels from 824to849MHz are used formobile tobase station transmission, and832simplex channels from 869 to 894 MHz are used for base station to mobile transmission. Each ofthese simplex channels is30kHzwide. The 832 channels are divided into four categories. Control channels (base to mobile) are used to manage the system. Paging channels (base to mobile) alert mobile users to calls for them. Access channels (bidirectional) are used for call setup and channel assignment. Finally, data channels (bidirectional) carry voice, fax, or data. Since the same frequencies cannot be reused in nearby cells and 21 channels are reserved ineach cell forcontrol, the actual number ofvoice channels available percell ismuchsmaller than832,typically about45. CallManagement Each mobile telephone in AMPS has a 32-bit serial number and a 10-digit telephone number in its programmable read-only memory. The telephone number is represented as a 3-digit area code in 10 bits and a 7-digit subscriber number in 24bits. When a phone is switched on,itscans a preprogrammed list of21control channels to find the most powerful signal. The phone then broadcasts its 32-bit serial number and 34-bit telephone number. Like all the control information in AMPS, this packet is sent in digital form, multiple times, and with an error-cor- recting code, even thoughthevoice channels themselves are analog. When the base station hears the announcement, it tells the MSC, which records the existence of its new customer and also informs the customer’s home MSC of his current location. During normal operation, the mobile telephone reregisters aboutonceevery 15minutes. To make a call, a mobile user switches on the phone, enters the number to be called on the keypad, and hits the SEND button. The phone then transmits the number to be called and its own identity on the access channel. If a collision oc- curs there, it tries again later. When the base station gets the request, it informs the MSC', 'If the caller is a customer of the MSC’s company (or one of its partners), the MSC looks for an idle channel for the call. If one is found, the channel number is sent back onthe control channel. The mobile phone then auto- matically switches to the selected voice channel and waits until the called party picksupthephone. Incoming calls work differently. To start with, all idle phones continuously listen to the paging channel to detect messages directed at them. When a call is placed to a mobile phone (either from a fixed phone or another mobile phone), a packet is sent to the callee’s home MSC to find out where it is. A packet is then 170 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 sent to the base station in its current cell, which sends a broadcast on the paging channel of the form ‘‘Unit 14, are you there?’’ The called phone responds with a ‘‘Yes’’ on the access channel. The base then says something like: ‘‘Unit 14, call for you on channel 3.’’ At this point, the called phone switches to channel 3 and starts making ringing sounds (or playing some melody the owner was given as a birthday present). 2.7.2 Second-Generation (2G) Mobile Phones: Digital Voice The first generation of mobile phones was analog; the second generation is digital. Switching to digital has several advantages. It provides capacity gains by allowing voice signals to be digitized and compressed. It improves security by al- lowing voice and control signals to be encrypted. This in turn deters fraud and eavesdropping, whether from intentional scanning or echoes of other calls due to RFpropagation. Finally, itenables newservices suchastextmessaging. Just as there was no worldwide standardization during the first generation, there was also no worldwide standardization during the second, either. Several different systems were developed, and three have been widely deployed. D- AMPS (Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System) is a digital version of AMPS that coexists with AMPS and uses TDM to place multiple calls on the same fre- quency channel. It is described in International Standard IS-54 and its successor IS-136. GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) has emerged as the dominant system, and while it was slow to catch on in the U.S. it is now used vir- tually everywhere in the world. Like D-AMPS, GSM is based on a mix of FDM andTDM. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access),described inInternational Standard IS-95, is a completely different kind of system and is based on neither FDM mor TDM. While CDMA has not become the dominant 2G system, its technologyhasbecome thebasisfor3Gsystems. Also, the name PCS (Personal Communications Services) is sometimes used in the marketing literature to indicate a second-generation (i.e., digital) sys- tem. Originally it meant a mobile phone using the 1900 MHz band, but that dis- tinction israrely made now. We will now describe GSM, since it is the dominant 2G system. In the next section wewillhave more tosayaboutCDMAwhenwedescribe 3Gsystems. GSM—The Global System forMobile Communications GSM started life in the 1980s as an effort to produce a single European 2G standard', 'Thetaskwas assigned toatelecommunications groupcalled (inFrench) Groupe Speciale´ Mobile. The first GSM systems were deployed starting in 1991 and were a quick success. It soon became clear that GSM was going to be more than a European success, with uptake stretching to countries as far away as Aus- tralia, soGSMwas renamed tohaveamore worldwide appeal. SEC. 2.7 THEMOBILETELEPHONESYSTEM 171 GSM and the other mobile phone systems we will study retain from 1G sys- tems a design based on cells, frequency reuse across cells, and mobility with handoffs as subscribers move. It is the details that differ. Here, we will briefly discuss some of the main properties of GSM. However, the printed GSM stan- dard is over 5000 [sic] pages long. A large fraction of this material relates to en- gineering aspects of the system, especially the design of receivers to handle mul- tipath signal propagation, and synchronizing transmitters and receivers. None of thiswillbeeven mentioned here. Fig.2-46 shows that the GSM architecture is similar to the AMPS architec- ture, though the components have different names. The mobile itself is now di- vided into the handset and a removable chip with subscriber and account infor- mation called a SIM card, short for Subscriber Identity Module. It is the SIM card that activates the handset and contains secrets that let the mobile and the net- work identify each other and encrypt conversations. A SIM card can be removed and plugged into a different handset to turn that handset into yourmobile as far as thenetwork isconcerned. Air interface BSC HLR SIM MSC PSTN card VLR BSC Celltowerand Handset basestation Figure2-46. GSMmobilenetworkarchitecture. The mobile talks to cell base stations over an air interface that we will de- scribe in a moment. The cell base stations are each connected to a BSC (Base Station Controller)that controls the radio resources ofcells andhandles handoff. The BSC in turn is connected to an MSC (as in AMPS) that routes calls and con- nects tothePSTN (Public Switched TelephoneNetwork). Tobeable toroute calls, theMSCneeds toknowwhere mobiles can currently be found. It maintains a database of nearby mobiles that are associated with the cells it manages. This database is called the VLR (Visitor Location Register). There is also a database in the mobile network that gives the last known location ofeachmobile. Itiscalled the HLR (Home Location Register). This database is used to route incoming calls to the right locations. Both databases must be kept uptodate asmobiles movefromcell tocell. We will now describe the air interface in some detail. GSM runs on a range of frequencies worldwide, including 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz. More spectrum is allocated than for AMPS in order to support a much larger number of users. GSM 172 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 is a frequency division duplex cellular system, like AMPS. That is, each mobile transmits on one frequency and receives on another, higher frequency (55 MHz higher for GSM versus 80MHz higher forAMPS). However, unlike withAMPS, with GSM a single frequency pair is split by time-division multiplexing into time slots. Inthiswayitisshared bymultiplemobiles', 'To handle multiple mobiles, GSM channels are much wider than the AMPS channels (200-kHz versus 30 kHz). One 200-kHz channel is shown in Fig.2-47. A GSM system operating in the 900-MHz region has 124 pairs of simplex chan- nels. Each simplex channel is 200 kHz wide and supports eight separate con- nections on it, using time division multiplexing. Each currently active station is assigned one time slot on one channel pair. Theoretically, 992 channels can be supported in each cell, but many of them are not available, to avoid frequency conflicts with neighboring cells. In Fig. 2-47, the eight shaded time slots all be- long to the same connection, four of them in each direction. Transmitting and re- ceiving does not happen in the same time slot because the GSM radios cannot transmit and receive at the same time and it takes time to switch from one to the other. If the mobile device assigned to 890.4/935.4 MHz and time slot 2 wanted to transmit to the base station, it would use the lower four shaded slots (and the ones following them in time), putting some data in each slot until all the data had been sent. 959.8MHz 935.4MHz 935.2MHz 914.8MHz 890.4MHz 890.2MHz ycneuqerF TDMframe Channel 124 Base 2 tomobile 1 124 Mobile tobase 2 1 Time Figure2-47. GSM uses 124 frequency channels, each of which uses an eight- slotTDMsystem. The TDM slots shown in Fig.2-47 are part of a complex framing hierarchy. Each TDM slot has a specific structure, and groups of TDM slots form mul- tiframes, also with a specific structure. A simplified version of this hierarchy is shown in Fig.2-48. Here we can see that each TDM slot consists of a 148-bit data frame that occupies the channel for577μsec (including a30-μsec guard time SEC. 2.7 THEMOBILETELEPHONESYSTEM 173 after each slot). Each data frame starts and ends with three 0 bits, for frame del- ineation purposes. It also contains two 57-bit Information fields, each one having a control bit that indicates whether the following Information field is for voice or data. Between the Information fields is a 26-bit Sync (training) field that is used bythereceivertosynchronize tothesender’s frame boundaries. 32,500-Bitmultiframesentin120msec C 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 T 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 L Reserved forfuture 1250-BitTDMframesentin4.615msec use 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.25–bit (30μsec) guardtime 148-Bitdataframesentin547μsec 000 Information Sync Information 000 Bits 3 57 26 57 3 Voice/databit Figure2-48. AportionoftheGSMframingstructure. A data frame is transmitted in 547 μsec, but a transmitter is only allowed to send one data frame every 4.615 msec, since it is sharing the channel with seven other stations. The grossrate ofeachchannel is270,833bps,dividedamongeight users. However, as with AMPS, the overhead eats upalarge fraction ofthe band- width, ultimately leaving 24.7 kbps worth of payload per user before error cor- rection. After error correction, 13 kbps is left for speech', 'While this is substan- tially less than 64 kbps PCM for uncompressed voice signals in the fixed tele- phone network, compression on the mobile device can reach these levels with lit- tlelossofquality. As can be seen from Fig.2-48, eight data frames make up a TDM frame and 26 TDM frames make up a 120-msec multiframe. Of the 26 TDM frames in a multiframe, slot 12 is used for control and slot 25 is reserved for future use, so only24are available forusertraffic. However, in addition to the 26-slot multiframe shown in Fig.2-48, a 51-slot multiframe (not shown) is also used. Some of these slots are used to hold several control channels used tomanage the system. The broadcast control channel is a continuous stream of output from the base station containing the base station’s identity and the channel status. All mobile stations monitor their signal strength tosee whentheyhave movedintoanewcell. 174 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 The dedicated control channel is used for location updating, registration, and call setup. In particular, each BSC maintains a database of mobile stations currently under its jurisdiction, the VLR. Information needed to maintain the VLRissentonthededicated control channel. Finally, there is the common control channel, which is split up into three logical subchannels. The first of these subchannels is the paging channel, which the base station uses to announce incoming calls. Each mobile station monitors it continuously to watch for calls it should answer. The second is the random ac- cess channel, which allows users to request a slot on the dedicated control chan- nel. If two requests collide, they are garbled and have to be retried later. Using the dedicated control channel slot, the station can set up a call. The assigned slot isannouncedonthethirdsubchannel, theaccessgrant channel. Finally, GSM differs from AMPS in how handoff is handled. In AMPS, the MSC manages it completely without help from the mobile devices. With time slots in GSM, the mobile is neither sending nor receiving most of the time. The idle slots are an opportunity for the mobile to measure signal quality to other nearby base stations. It does so and sends this information to the BSC. The BSC can use it to determine when a mobile is leaving one cell and entering another so it can perform the handoff. This design is called MAHO (Mobile Assisted HandOff). 2.7.3 Third-Generation (3G) Mobile Phones: Digital Voice and Data The first generation of mobile phones was analog voice, and the second gen- eration was digital voice. The third generation of mobile phones, or 3G as it is called, isallaboutdigital voice anddata. A number of factors are driving the industry. First, data traffic already exceeds voice traffic on the fixed network and is growing exponentially, whereas voice traffic is essentially flat. Many industry experts expect data traffic to dom- inate voice onmobile devices as well soon. Second,the telephone,entertainment, and computer industries have all gone digital and are rapidly converging. Many people are drooling over lightweight, portable devices that act as atelephone,mu- sic and video player, email terminal, Web interface, gaming machine, and more, allwithworldwide wireless connectivitytotheInternet athighbandwidth', 'Apple’s iPhone is a good example of this kind of 3G device. With it, people get hooked on wireless data services, and AT&T wireless data volumes are rising steeply withthe popularityofiPhones. The troubleis, the iPhoneuses a2.5Gnet- work (an enhanced 2G network, but not a true 3G network) and there is not enough data capacity to keep users happy. 3G mobile telephony is all about pro- vidingenoughwireless bandwidth tokeep these future usershappy. ITU tried to get a bit more specific about this vision starting back around 1992. It issued a blueprint for getting there called IMT-2000, where IMT stood SEC. 2.7 THEMOBILETELEPHONESYSTEM 175 for International Mobile Telecommunications. The basic services that the IMT-2000network was supposedtoprovidetoitsusersare: 1. High-qualityvoice transmission. 2. Messaging (replacing email, fax,SMS, chat, etc.). 3. Multimedia(playing music, viewing videos, films, television, etc.). 4. Internet access(Web surfing,including pages withaudioandvideo). Additional services might be video conferencing, telepresence, group game play- ing, and m-commerce (waving your telephone at the cashier to pay in a store). Furthermore, all these services are supposed to be available worldwide (with automatic connection via a satellite when no terrestrial network can be located), instantly (always on),andwithqualityofservice guarantees. ITU envisioned a single worldwide technology for IMT-2000, so manufact- urers could build a single device that could be sold and used anywhere in the world (like CD players and computers and unlike mobile phones and televisions). Having asingle technologywouldalsomake life muchsimpler fornetwork opera- tors and would encourage more people to use the services. Format wars, such as theBetamax versusVHSbattlewithvideorecorders, are notgoodforbusiness. As it turned out, this was a bit optimistic. The number 2000 stood for three things: (1) the year it was supposed to go into service, (2) the frequency it was supposed to operate at (in MHz), and (3) the bandwidth the service should have (in kbps). It did not make it on any of the three counts. Nothing was imple- mented by 2000. ITU recommended that all governments reserve spectrum at 2 GHz so devices could roam seamlessly from country to country. China reserved the required bandwidth but nobody else did. Finally, it was recognized that 2 Mbps is not currently feasible for users who are too mobile (due to the difficulty of performing handoffs quickly enough). More realistic is 2 Mbps for stationary indoorusers (which willcompete head-on withADSL), 384kbpsforpeople walk- ing,and144kbpsforconnectionsincars. Despite these initial setbacks, much has been accomplished since then. Sev- eral IMT proposals were made and, after some winnowing, it came down to two main ones. The first one, WCDMA (Wideband CDMA), was proposed by Ericsson andwas pushed bythe European Union, which called itUMTS (Univer- sal Mobile Telecommunications System). The other contender was CDMA2000,proposedbyQualcomm. Bothofthese systems are more similar than different inthat they are based on broadband CDMA; WCDMA uses 5-MHz channels and CDMA2000 uses 1.25- MHz channels. If the Ericsson and Qualcomm engineers were put in a room and told to come to a common design, they probably could find one fairly quickly. The trouble is that the real problem is not engineering, but politics (as usual)', 'Europe wanted a system that interworked with GSM, whereas the U.S. wanted a 176 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 system that was compatible with one already widely deployed in the U.S. (IS-95). Each side also supported its local company (Ericsson is based in Sweden; Qual- comm is in California). Finally, Ericsson and Qualcomm were involved in num- erouslawsuits overtheir respective CDMApatents. Worldwide, 10–15% of mobile subscribers already use 3G technologies. In North America and Europe, around a third of mobile subscribers are 3G. Japan was an early adopter and now nearly all mobile phones in Japan are 3G. These figures include the deployment ofbothUMTS andCDMA2000,and 3Gcontinues tobeonegreat cauldron ofactivity as the market shakes out. Toadd tothe confu- sion, UMTS became a single 3G standard with multiple incompatible options, in- cluding CDMA2000. This change was an effort to unify the various camps, but it just papers over the technical differences and obscures the focus of ongoing efforts. WewilluseUMTStomean WCDMA, asdistinct fromCDMA2000. We will focus our discussion on the use of CDMA in cellular networks, as it is the distinguishing feature of both systems. CDMA is neither FDM nor TDM but a kind of mix in which each user sends on the same frequency band at the same time. When it was first proposed for cellular systems, the industry gave it approximately the same reaction that Columbus first got from Queen Isabella when he proposed reaching India by sailing in the wrong direction. However, through the persistence of a single company, Qualcomm, CDMA succeeded as a 2G system (IS-95) and matured to the point that it became the technical basis for 3G. To make CDMA work in the mobile phone setting requires more than the basic CDMA technique that we described in the previous section. Specifically, we described synchronous CDMA, in which the chip sequences are exactly orthogonal.Thisdesign workswhen all users are synchronized onthestart time of their chip sequences, as in the case of the base station transmitting to mobiles. The base station can transmit the chip sequences starting at the same time so that the signals will be orthogonal and able to be separated. However, it is difficult to synchronize the transmissions of independent mobile phones. Without care, their transmissions wouldarrive at the base station at different times, withnoguarantee of orthogonality. To let mobiles send to the base station without synchronization, we want code sequences that are orthogonal to each other at all possible offsets, notsimplywhentheyare aligned atthestart. While it is not possible to find sequences that are exactly orthogonal for this general case, long pseudorandom sequences come close enough. They have the property that, with high probability, they have a low cross-correlation with each other at all offsets. This means that when one sequence is multiplied by another sequence and summed uptocompute the inner product, the result will be small; it would be zero if they were orthogonal. (Intuitively, random sequences should al- ways look different from each other', 'Multiplying them together should then pro- duce a random signal, which will sum to a small result.) This lets a receiver filter unwanted transmissions out of the received signal. Also, the auto-correlation of SEC. 2.7 THEMOBILETELEPHONESYSTEM 177 pseudorandom sequences is also small, with high probability,except at a zero off- set. This means that when one sequence is multiplied by a delayed copy of itself and summed, the result will be small, except when the delay is zero. (Intuitively, a delayed random sequence looks like a different random sequence, and we are back to the cross-correlation case.) This lets a receiver lock ontothe beginning of thewanted transmission inthereceivedsignal. The use ofpseudorandomsequences lets the base station receive CDMA mes- sages from unsynchronized mobiles. However, an implicit assumption in our dis- cussion of CDMA is that the power levels of all mobiles are the same at the re- ceiver. If they are not, a small cross-correlation with a powerful signal might overwhelm a large auto-correlation with a weak signal. Thus, the transmit power on mobiles must be controlled to minimize interference between competing sig- nals. Itisthisinterference thatlimits thecapacity ofCDMAsystems. The power levels receivedat a base station depend onhow far away the trans- mitters are as well as how much power they transmit. There may bemany mobile stations at varying distances from the base station. A good heuristic to equalize the received power is for each mobile station to transmit to the base station at the inverse of the power level it receives from the base station. In other words, a mobile station receiving a weak signal from the base station will use more power than one getting a strong signal. For more accuracy, the base station also gives eachmobile feedback toincrease, decrease, orholdsteady itstransmit power. The feedback is frequent (1500 times per second) because good power control is im- portant tominimize interference. Another improvement overthebasic CDMAscheme wedescribed earlier isto allow different users to send data at different rates. This trick is accomplished naturally inCDMA byfixing the rate at which chips are transmitted and assigning users chip sequences ofdifferent lengths. For example, inWCDMA, thechiprate is 3.84 Mchips/sec and the spreading codes vary from 4 to 256 chips. With a 256- chip code, around 12 kbps is left after error correction, and this capacity is suffi- cient for a voice call. With a 4-chip code, the user data rate is close to 1 Mbps. Intermediate-length codes give intermediate rates; to get to multiple Mbps, the mobile mustusemore thanone5-MHz channel atonce. Now let us describe the advantages of CDMA, given that we have dealt with the problems of getting it to work. It has three main advantages. First, CDMA can improve capacity by taking advantage of small periods when some trans- mitters are silent. In polite voice calls, one party is silent while the other talks. On average, thelineisbusyonly40%ofthe time. However, the pauses may be small and are difficult to predict. With TDM or FDM systems, it isnotpossible toreas- sign time slots or frequency channels quickly enough to benefit from these small silences', 'However, in CDMA, by simply not transmitting one user lowers the in- terference for other users, and it is likely that some fraction of users will not be transmitting in a busy cell at any given time. Thus CDMA takes advantage of ex- pected silences toallow alarger number ofsimultaneous calls. 178 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 Second, with CDMA each cell uses the same frequencies. Unlike GSM and AMPS, FDM is not needed to separate the transmissions of different users. This eliminates complicated frequency planning tasks and improves capacity. It also makes it easy for a base station to use multiple directional antennas, or sectored antennas, instead of an omnidirectional antenna. Directional antennas concen- trate a signal in the intended direction and reduce the signal, and hence inter- ference, in other directions. This in turn increases capacity. Three sector designs are common. The base station must track the mobile as it moves from sector to sector. This tracking is easy with CDMA because all frequencies are used in all sectors. Third, CDMA facilitates soft handoff, in which the mobile is acquired by the new base station before the previous one signs off. In this way there is no loss of continuity. Soft handoffis shown inFig. 2-49. It is easy with CDMA because all frequencies are used in each cell. The alternative is a hard handoff,in which the old base station drops the call before the new one acquires it. If the new one is unable to acquire it (e.g., because there is no available frequency), the call is disconnected abruptly. Users tend to notice this, but it is inevitable occasionally with the current design. Hard handoff is the norm with FDM designs to avoid the costofhavingthemobile transmit orreceiveontwofrequencies simultaneously. (a) (b) (c) Figure2-49. Softhandoff(a)before,(b)during,and(c)after. Much has been written about 3G, most of it praising it as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Meanwhile, many operators have taken cautious steps in the direction of 3G by going to what is sometimes called 2.5G, although 2.1G might be more accurate. One such system is EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), which is just GSM with more bits per symbol. The trouble is, more bits per symbol also means more errors per symbol, so EDGE has nine different schemes for modulation and error correction, differing in terms of how much of the bandwidth is devoted to fixing the errors introduced by the higher speed. EDGE is one step along an evolutionary path that is defined from GSM to WCDMA. Similarly, there is an evolutionary path defined for operators to upgradefromIS-95toCDMA2000networks. Even though 3G networks are not fully deployed yet, some researchers regard 3G as a done deal. These people are already working on 4G systems under the SEC. 2.7 THEMOBILETELEPHONESYSTEM 179 name of LTE (Long Term Evolution). Some of the proposed features of 4G in- clude: high bandwidth; ubiquity (connectivity everywhere); seamless integration with other wired and wireless IP networks, including 802.11 access points; adap- tive resource and spectrum management; and high quality of service for multi- media. Formoreinformation see Astely etal.(2009)andLarmo etal.(2009)', 'Meanwhile, wireless networks with 4G levels of performance are already available. The main example is 802.16, also known as WiMAX. For anoverview of mobile WiMAX see Ahmadi (2009). To say the industry is in a state of flux is ahugeunderstatement. Check backinafew years tosee what hashappened. 2.8 CABLE TELEVISION We have now studied both the fixed and wireless telephone systems in a fair amount of detail. Both will clearly play a major role in future networks. But there is another major player that has emerged over the past decade for Internet access: cable television networks. Many people nowadays get their telephoneand Internet service over cable. In the following sections we will look at cable tele- vision as a network in more detail and contrast it with the telephone systems we have just studied. Some relevant references for more information are Donaldson andJones(2001),Dutta-Roy (2001),andFellows andJones(2001). 2.8.1 Community Antenna Television Cable television was conceived in the late 1940s as a way to provide better reception topeople living inrural ormountainousareas. The system initiallycon- sisted of a big antenna on top of a hill to pluck the television signal out of the air, an amplifier, called the headend, to strengthen it, and a coaxial cable to deliver it topeople’s houses,asillustratedinFig.2-50. Antennaforpicking updistantsignals Headend Dropcable Tap Coaxialcable Figure2-50. Anearlycabletelevisionsystem. In the early years, cable television was called Community Antenna Televis- ion. It was very much a mom-and-pop operation; anyone handy with electronics 180 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 could set up a service for his town, and the users would chip in to pay the costs. As the number of subscribers grew, additional cables were spliced onto the origi- nal cable and amplifiers were added as needed. Transmission was one way, from theheadend totheusers. By1970,thousandsofindependent systems existed. In1974,Time Inc. started anewchannel, HomeBoxOffice, withnewcontent (movies) distributed only on cable. Other cable-only channels followed, focusing on news, sports, cooking, and many other topics. This development gave rise to two changes in the industry. First, large corporations began buying up existing cable systems and laying new cable to acquire new subscribers. Second, there was nowaneed toconnectmultiplesystems, often indistant cities,inordertodis- tribute the new cable channels. The cable companies began to lay cable between the cities to connect them all into a single system. This pattern was analogous to what happened in the telephone industry 80 years earlier with the connection of previously isolated endoffices tomake long-distancecallingpossible. 2.8.2 Internet over Cable Over thecourse oftheyears thecable system grew and the cables between the various cities were replaced by high-bandwidth fiber, similar to what happened in the telephone system. A system with fiber for the long-haul runs and coaxial cable to the houses is called an HFC (Hybrid Fiber Coax) system. The electro- optical convertersthatinterfacebetween the optical and electrical parts ofthe sys- tem are called fiber nodes. Because the bandwidth of fiber is so much greater than that of coax, a fiber node can feed multiple coaxial cables. Part of a modern HFCsystem isshowninFig. 2-51(a)', 'Over the past decade, many cable operators decided to get into the Internet access business, and often the telephony business as well. Technical differences between the cable plant and telephone plant had an effect on what had to be done to achieve these goals. For one thing, all the one-way amplifiers in the system had to be replaced by two-way amplifiers to support upstream as well as down- stream transmissions. While this was happening, early Internet over cable sys- tems used the cable television network for downstream transmissions and a dial- up connection via the telephone network for upstream transmissions. It was a clever workaround,butnotmuchofanetwork compared towhat itcouldbe. However, there is another difference between the HFC system of Fig. 2-51(a) and the telephone system of Fig. 2-51(b) that is much harder to remove. Down in the neighborhoods, a single cable is shared by many houses, whereas in the tele- phone system, every house has its own private local loop. When used for televis- ion broadcasting, this sharing is a natural fit. All the programs are broadcast on the cable and it does not matter whether there are 10 viewers or 10,000 viewers. When the same cable is used for Internet access, however, it matters a lot if there are 10 users or 10,000. If one user decides to download a very large file, that bandwidth ispotentially being taken away from other users. The more users there SEC. 2.8 CABLETELEVISION 181 High-bandwidth fiber Switch Coaxial trunk cable Fibernode Head- end Tap House Fiber (a) House Toll High-bandwidth End Local office fibertrunk office loop Fiber Copper twistedpair (b) Figure2-51. (a)Cabletelevision.(b)Thefixedtelephonesystem. are, the more competition there is for bandwidth. The telephone system does not have this particular property: downloading alarge file overanADSL linedoesnot reduce your neighbor’s bandwidth. On the other hand, the bandwidth of coax is much higher than that of twisted pairs, so you can get lucky if your neighbors do notusetheInternet much. The way the cable industry has tackled this problem is to split up long cables andconnecteach one directly toafiber node. The bandwidth fromtheheadend to each fiber node is effectively infinite, so as long as there are not too many sub- scribers on each cable segment, the amount of traffic is manageable. Typical 182 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 cables nowadays have 500–2000 houses, but as more and more people subscribe toInternet overcable, theloadmaybecome toogreat, requiring more splittingand more fibernodes. 2.8.3 Spectrum Allocation Throwing off all the TV channels and using the cable infrastructure strictly for Internet access would probably generate a fair number of irate customers, so cable companies are hesitant to do this. Furthermore, most cities heavily regulate what isonthe cable, sothecable operators wouldnotbeallowed todothisevenif they really wanted to. As a consequence, they needed to find a way to have tele- visionandInternet peacefullycoexist onthesame cable. The solution is to build on frequency division multiplexing. Cable television channels in North America occupy the 54–550 MHz region (except for FM radio, from 88 to 108 MHz). These channels are 6-MHz wide, including guard bands, andcan carry onetraditionalanalog television channel orseveral digital television channels', 'In Europe the low end is usually 65 MHz and the channels are 6–8 MHz wide for the higher resolution required by PAL and SECAM, but otherwise the allocation scheme is similar. The low part of the band is not used. Modern cables can also operate well above 550 MHz, often at up to 750 MHz or more. The solution chosen was to introduce upstream channels in the 5–42 MHz band (slightly higher in Europe) and use the frequencies at the high end for the down- stream signals. The cable spectrum isillustratedinFig.2-52. 0 108 TV TV Downstreamdata Downstreamfrequencies maertspU maertspU atad seicneuqerf 54254 88 550 750MHz FM Figure2-52. Frequency allocation inatypical cable TV system used for Inter- netaccess. Note that since the television signals are all downstream, it is possible to use upstream amplifiers that work only in the 5–42 MHz region and downstream amplifiers that workonlyat 54MHz and up, as shown in the figure. Thus, we get an asymmetry in the upstream and downstream bandwidths because more spec- trum is available above television than below it. On the other hand, most users want more downstream traffic, so cable operators are not unhappy with this fact SEC. 2.8 CABLETELEVISION 183 oflife. As we saw earlier, telephone companies usually offer an asymmetric DSL service, even thoughtheyhave notechnical reason fordoingso. In addition to upgrading the amplifiers, the operator has to upgrade the headend, too, from a dumb amplifier to an intelligent digital computer system with a high-bandwidth fiber interface to an ISP. Often the name gets upgraded as well, from ‘‘headend’’ to CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System). In the following text, we will refrain from doing a name upgrade and stick with the tra- ditional‘‘headend.’’ 2.8.4 Cable Modems Internet access requires a cable modem, a device that has two interfaces on it: one to the computer and one to the cable network. In the early years of cable In- ternet, each operator had a proprietary cable modem, which was installed by a cable company technician. However, it soon became apparent that an open stan- dard would create a competitive cable modem market and drive down prices, thus encouraging use of the service. Furthermore, having the customers buy cable modems in stores and install them themselves (as they do with wireless access points)wouldeliminate thedreaded truckrolls. Consequently, the larger cable operators teamed up with a company called CableLabs to produce a cable modem standard and to test products for compli- ance. This standard, called DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Spe- cification), has mostly replaced proprietary modems. DOCSIS version 1.0 came out in 1997, and was soon followed by DOCSIS 2.0 in 2001. It increased up- stream rates to better support symmetric services such as IP telephony. The most recent version of the standard is DOCSIS 3.0, which came out in 2006. It uses more bandwidth to increase rates in both directions. The European version of these standards is called EuroDOCSIS', 'Not all cable operators like the idea of a standard, however, since many of them were making good money leasing their modems to their captive customers. An open standard with dozens of manufact- urers sellingcable modems instores endsthislucrative practice. The modem-to-computer interface is straightforward. It is normally Ethernet, or occasionally USB. The other end is more complicated as it uses all of FDM, TDM,andCDMAtoshare thebandwidth ofthecable between subscribers. When a cable modem is plugged in and powered up, it scans the downstream channels looking for a special packet periodically put out by the headend to pro- vide system parameters to modems that have just come online. Upon finding this packet, the new modem announces its presence on one of the upstream channels. The headend responds by assigning the modem to its upstream and downstream channels. These assignments can be changed later if the headend deems it neces- sarytobalance theload. The use of 6-MHz or 8-MHz channels is the FDM part. Each cable modem sends data on one upstream and one downstream channel, or multiple channels 184 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 under DOCSIS 3.0. The usual scheme is to take each 6 (or 8) MHz downstream channel and modulate it with QAM-64 or, if the cable quality is exceptionally good, QAM-256. With a 6-MHz channel and QAM-64, we get about 36 Mbps. When the overhead is subtracted, the net payload is about 27 Mbps. With QAM- 256,thenetpayload isabout39Mbps. The European values are 1/3larger. For upstream, there is more RF noise because the system was not originally designed for data, and noise from multiple subscribers is funneled to the headend, so a more conservative scheme is used. This ranges from QPSK to QAM-128, where some of the symbols are used for error protection with Trellis Coded Mod- ulation. With fewer bits per symbol on the upstream, the asymmetry between upstream anddownstream rates ismuchmorethansuggestedbyFig.2-52. TDM is then used to share bandwidth on the upstream across multiple sub- scribers. Otherwise their transmissions would collide at the headend. Time is di- vided into minislots and different subscribers send in different minislots. To make this work, the modem determines its distance from the headend by sending it a special packet and seeing how long it takes to get the response. This process is called ranging. It is important for the modem to know its distance to get the timing right. Each upstream packet must fit in one or more consecutive minislots at the headend when it is received. The headend announces the start of a new round of minislots periodically, but the starting gun is not heard at all modems si- multaneously due to the propagation time down the cable. By knowing how far it is from the headend, each modem can compute how long ago the first minislot really started. Minislot lengthisnetwork dependent. Atypical payload is8bytes. During initialization, the headend assigns each modem to a minislot to use for requesting upstream bandwidth. When a computer wants to send a packet, it transfers the packet to the modem, which then requests the necessary number of minislots for it', 'If the request is accepted, the headend puts an acknowledgement onthedownstream channel tellingthemodemwhich minislots have been reserved for its packet. The packet is then sent, starting inthe minislot allocated toit. Ad- ditionalpackets can berequested usingafield intheheader. Asarule, multiplemodemswillbe assigned the same minislot, which leads to contention. Two different possibilities exist for dealing with it. The first is that CDMA is used to share the minislot between subscribers. This solves the con- tention problem because all subscribers with a CDMA code sequence can send at the same time, albeit at a reduced rate. The second option is that CDMA is not used, inwhich case there may be noacknowledgement tothe request because ofa collision. In this case, the modem just waits a random time and tries again. After each successive failure, the randomization time is doubled. (For readers already somewhat familiarwithnetworking, thisalgorithm isjustslotted ALOHAwithbi- nary exponential backoff. Ethernet cannot be used on cable because stations can- notsense themedium. We willcome back tothese issuesinChap. 4.) The downstream channels are managed differently from the upstream chan- nels. For starters, there isonlyone sender (the headend), sothere isnocontention SEC. 2.8 CABLETELEVISION 185 and no need for minislots, which is actually just statistical time division multi- plexing. For another, the amount of traffic downstream is usually much larger than upstream, so a fixed packet size of 204 bytes is used. Part of that is a Reed- Solomon error-correcting code and some other overhead, leaving a user payload of184bytes. These numbers were chosen forcompatibilitywithdigital television using MPEG-2, so the TV and downstream data channels are formatted the same way. Logically, theconnectionsare asdepicted inFig.2-53. Figure2-53. TypicaldetailsoftheupstreamanddownstreamchannelsinNorth America. 2.8.5 ADSL Versus Cable Which is better, ADSL or cable? That is like asking which operating system is better. Or which language is better. Or which religion. Which answer you get depends on whom you ask. Let us compare ADSL and cable on a few points. Both use fiber in the backbone, but they differ on the edge. Cable uses coax; ADSL uses twisted pair. The theoretical carrying capacity of coax is hundreds of times more than twisted pair. However, the full capacity of the cable is not avail- able for data users because much of the cable’s bandwidth is wasted on useless stuffsuchastelevision programs. In practice, it is hard to generalize about effective capacity. ADSL providers give specific statements about the bandwidth (e.g., 1 Mbps downstream, 256kbps upstream) and generally achieve about 80% of it consistently. Cable providers may artificially cap the bandwidth to each user to help them make performance predictions, but they cannot really give guarantees because the effective capacity depends on how many people are currently active on the user’s cable segment. Sometimes it may be better than ADSL and sometimes it may be worse. What can be annoying, though, is the unpredictability. Having great service one minute does not guarantee great service the next minute since the biggest bandwidth hog intownmayhave justturnedonhiscomputer. 186 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP', '2 As an ADSL system acquires more users, their increasing numbers have little effect on existing users, since each user has a dedicated connection. With cable, as more subscribers sign up for Internet service, performance for existing users will drop. The only cure is for the cable operator to split busy cables and connect each one to a fiber node directly. Doing so costs time and money, so there are business pressures toavoidit. As an aside, we have already studied another system with a shared channel like cable: the mobile telephone system. Here, too, a group of users—we could call them cellmates—share a fixed amount of bandwidth. For voice traffic, which isfairly smooth, the bandwidth isrigidlydividedinfixed chunksamongtheactive users using FDM and TDM. But for data traffic, this rigid division is very ineffi- cient because data users are frequently idle, in which case their reserved band- width is wasted. As with cable, a more dynamic means is used to allocate the shared bandwidth. Availabilityisanissueonwhich ADSL andcable differ. Everyonehas a tele- phone, butnot all users are close enoughtotheir endoffices toget ADSL. Onthe other hand,noteveryonehascable, butifyoudohave cable and the company pro- vides Internet access, you can get it. Distance to the fiber node or headend is not an issue. It is also worth noting that since cable started out as a television distrib- utionmedium, few businesses have it. Being a point-to-point medium, ADSL is inherently more secure than cable. Any cable user can easily read all the packets going down the cable. For this rea- son, any decent cable provider will encrypt all traffic in both directions. Never- theless, having your neighbor get yourencrypted messages is still less secure than havinghimnotgetanythingatall. The telephone system is generally more reliable than cable. For example, it has backup power and continues to work normally even during a power outage. With cable, if the power to any amplifier along the chain fails, all downstream users are cutoffinstantly. Finally, most ADSL providers offer a choice of ISPs. Sometimes they are even required todosobylaw. Suchisnotalways thecase withcable operators. The conclusion isthat ADSL andcable are much more alike than they are dif- ferent. They offer comparable service and, as competition between them heats up,probablycomparable prices. 2.9 SUMMARY The physical layer is the basis of all networks. Nature imposes two funda- mental limits on all channels, and these determine their bandwidth. These limits are the Nyquist limit, which deals with noiseless channels, and the Shannon limit, whichdeals withnoisychannels. SEC. 2.9 SUMMARY 187 Transmission media can be guided or unguided. The principal guided media are twisted pair, coaxial cable, and fiber optics. Unguided media include terres- trial radio, microwaves, infrared, lasers throughtheair, andsatellites. Digital modulationmethodssendbitsover guided andunguidedmedia as ana- log signals. Line codes operate at baseband, and signals can be placed in a passband by modulating the amplitude, frequency, and phase of a carrier. Chan- nels can be shared between users with time, frequency and code division multi- plexing. A key element in most wide area networks is the telephone system. Its main components are the local loops, trunks, and switches', 'ADSL offers speeds up to 40Mbps over the local loopby dividing it into many subcarriers that run in paral- lel. This far exceeds the rates of telephone modems. PONs bring fiber to the homeforevengreater accessrates thanADSL. Trunks carry digital information. They are multiplexed with WDM to provi- sion many high capacity links over individual fibers, as well as with TDM to share each high rate link between users. Both circuit switching and packet switching are important. For mobile applications, the fixed telephone system is not suitable. Mobile phones are currently in widespread use for voice, and increasingly for data. They have gone through three generations. The first generation, 1G, was analog and dominated by AMPS. 2G was digital, with GSM presently the most widely de- ployed mobile phone system in the world. 3G is digital and based on broadband CDMA, withWCDMA andalsoCDMA2000nowbeingdeployed. Analternative system fornetwork accessis the cable television system. Ithas gradually evolved from coaxial cable to hybrid fiber coax, and from television to television and Internet. Potentially, it offers very high bandwidth, but the band- widthinpractice depends heavily ontheother users becauseitisshared. PROBLEMS 1.

The main program, which also acts as the joiner process first reads four chip sequences (bipolar notation) from the standard input and a sequence of 4 bits (1 bit per transmitter process to be transmitted), and forks off four pairs of transmitter and receiver processes. Each pair of transmitter/re- ceiver processes (t0,r0; t1,r1; t2,r2; t3,r3) is assigned one chip sequence and each transmitter process is assigned 1 bit (first bit to t0, second bit to t1, and so on). Next, each transmitter process computes the signal to be transmitted (a sequence of 8 bits) and sends it to the joiner process. After receiving signals from all four transmitter processes, the joiner process combines the signals and sends the combined signal to 192 THEPHYSICAL LAYER CHAP. 2 the four receiver processes', 'Each receiver process then computes the bit it has re- ceived and prints it to standard output. Use pipes for communication between proc- esses. 3 THE DATA LINK LAYER In this chapter we will study the design principles for the second layer in our model, the data link layer. This study deals with algorithms for achieving re- liable, efficient communication of whole units of information called frames (rath- er than individual bits, as in the physical layer) between two adjacent machines. By adjacent, we mean that the two machines are connected by a communication channel that acts conceptually like a wire (e.g., a coaxial cable, telephone line, or wireless channel). The essential property of a channel that makes it ‘‘wire-like’’ isthatthebitsare delivered inexactly thesame orderinwhich theyare sent. At first you might think this problem is so trivial that there is nothing to study—machine A just puts the bits on the wire, and machine B just takes them off. Unfortunately, communication channels make errors occasionally. Fur- thermore, they have only a finite data rate, and there is a nonzero propagation delay between the time a bit is sent and the time it is received. These limitations have important implications for the efficiency of the data transfer. The protocols used for communications must take all these factors into consideration. These protocols are thesubject ofthischapter. After anintroductiontothe keydesignissues present inthedata linklayer, we will start our study of its protocols bylookingat the nature of errors andhowthey can be detected and corrected. Then we will study a series of increasingly com- plex protocols, each one solving more and more of the problems present in this layer. Finally, wewillconclude withsomeexamples ofdata linkprotocols. 193 194 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 3.1 DATA LINK LAYER DESIGN ISSUES The data link layer uses the services of the physical layer to send and receive bitsovercommunication channels. Ithasanumberoffunctions, including: 1. Providingawell-defined service interfacetothe network layer. 2. Dealing withtransmission errors. 3. Regulating theflowofdata sothatslowreceiversare notswamped byfastsenders. To accomplish these goals, the data link layer takes the packets it gets from the network layer and encapsulates them into frames for transmission. Each frame contains a frame header, a payload field for holding the packet, and a frame trailer, as illustrated in Fig.3-1. Frame management forms the heart of what the data link layer does. In the following sections we will examine all the above- mentioned issuesindetail. Sendingmachine Receivingmachine Packet Packet Frame Header Payloadfield Trailer Header Payloadfield Trailer Figure3-1. Relationshipbetweenpacketsandframes. Although this chapter is explicitly about the data link layer and its protocols, many of the principles we will study here, such as error control and flow control, are foundintransport andother protocols as well. That is because reliability is an overall goal, andit isachieved when all the layers work together. Infact, inmany networks, these functions are found mostly in the upper layers, with the data link layer doing the minimal job that is ‘‘good enough.’’ However, no matter where they are found, the principles are pretty much the same', 'They often show up in their simplest and purest forms in the data link layer, making this a good place to examine themindetail. 3.1.1 Services Provided to the Network Layer The function of the data link layer is to provide services to the network layer. The principal service istransferring data fromthenetwork layer onthesource ma- chine to the network layer on the destination machine. On the source machine is SEC. 3.1 DATALINKLAYERDESIGNISSUES 195 an entity, call it a process, in the network layer that hands some bits to the data link layer for transmission to the destination. The job of the data link layer is to transmit the bits to the destination machine so they can be handed over to the net- work layer there, as shown in Fig.3-2(a). The actual transmission follows the path of Fig.3-2(b), but it is easier to think in terms of two data link layer proc- esses communicating using a data link protocol. For this reason, we will impli- citlyusethemodelofFig.3-2(a)throughoutthischapter. Host1 Host2 Host1 Host2 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 Virtual datapath 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 Actual datapath (a) (b) Figure3-2. (a)Virtualcommunication.(b)Actualcommunication. The data link layer can be designed to offer various services. The actual ser- vices that are offered vary from protocol to protocol. Three reasonable possibili- ties thatwewillconsider inturnare: 1. Unacknowledgedconnectionlessservice. 2. Acknowledgedconnectionlessservice. 3. Acknowledgedconnection-orientedservice. Unacknowledged connectionless service consists of having the source ma- chine send independent frames to the destination machine without having the destination machine acknowledgethem. Ethernet isagoodexample ofadata link layer that provides this class of service. No logical connection is established be- forehand or released afterward. If a frame is lost due to noise on the line, no 196 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 attempt is made to detect the loss or recover from it in the data link layer. This class of service is appropriate when the error rate is very low, so recovery is left tohigher layers. Itisalso appropriate forreal-time traffic, suchasvoice, inwhich late data are worse thanbaddata. The next step up in terms of reliability is acknowledged connectionless ser- vice. When this service is offered, there are still no logical connections used, but each frame sent is individually acknowledged. In this way, the sender knows whether a frame has arrived correctly or been lost. If it has not arrived within a specified time interval, it can be sent again. This service is useful over unreliable channels, such as wireless systems. 802.11(WiFi) is a goodexample of this class ofservice. It is perhaps worth emphasizing that providing acknowledgements in the data link layer is just an optimization, never a requirement. The network layer can al- ways send a packet and wait for it to be acknowledged by its peer on the remote machine. Ifthe acknowledgementisnotforthcoming before the timer expires, the sender can just send the entire message again. The trouble with this strategy is that it can be inefficient. Links usually have a strict maximum frame length imposed bythe hardware, andknownpropagation delays. The network layer does not know these parameters', 'It might send a large packet that is broken up into, say, 10frames, ofwhich 2are lostonaverage. Itwouldthen take a very longtime for the packet to get through. Instead, if individual frames are acknowledged and retransmitted, then errors can be corrected more directly and more quickly. On reliable channels, such as fiber, the overhead of a heavyweight data link protocol may be unnecessary, but on (inherently unreliable) wireless channels it is well worththecost. Getting back toour services, the most sophisticated service the data link layer can provide tothenetwork layer isconnection-orientedservice. Withthisservice, the source and destination machines establish a connection before any data are transferred. Each frame sent over the connection is numbered, and the data link layer guarantees that each frame sent is indeed received. Furthermore, it guaran- tees that each frame is received exactly once and that all frames are received in therightorder. Connection-orientedservice thusprovides the network layer proc- esses withthe equivalent ofareliable bitstream. Itisappropriate overlong,unre- liable links such as a satellite channel or a long-distance telephone circuit. If acknowledged connectionless service were used, it is conceivable that lost ac- knowledgements could cause a frame to be sent and received several times, wast- ingbandwidth. When connection-oriented service is used, transfers go through three distinct phases. In the first phase, the connection is established by having both sides ini- tialize variables and counters needed to keep track of which frames have been re- ceived and which ones have not. In the second phase, one or more frames are ac- tually transmitted. In the third and final phase, the connection is released, freeing upthevariables, buffers, andotherresources usedtomaintain theconnection. SEC. 3.1 DATALINKLAYERDESIGNISSUES 197 3.1.2 Framing To provide service to the network layer, the data link layer must use the ser- vice provided to it by the physical layer. What the physical layer does is accept a raw bit stream and attempt to deliver it to the destination. If the channel is noisy, as it is for most wireless and some wired links, the physical layer will add some redundancytoitssignals toreduce the bit error rate toa tolerable level. However, the bit stream received by the data link layer is not guaranteed to be error free. Some bits may have different values and the number of bits received may be less than, equal to, or more than the number of bits transmitted. It is up to the data linklayer todetect and,ifnecessary,correct errors. The usual approach is for the data link layer to break up the bit stream into discrete frames, compute a short token called a checksum for each frame, and in- clude the checksum in the frame when it is transmitted. (Checksum algorithms will be discussed later in this chapter.) When a frame arrives at the destination, the checksum is recomputed. If the newly computed checksum is different from the one contained in the frame, the data link layer knows that an error has oc- curred and takes steps to deal with it (e.g., discarding the bad frame and possibly alsosendingback anerrorreport). Breaking upthe bit stream into frames ismore difficult than it at first appears', 'A good design must make it easy for a receiver to find the start of new frames while usinglittleofthechannel bandwidth. We willlookatfourmethods: 1. Byte count. 2. Flag byteswithbytestuffing. 3. Flag bitswithbitstuffing. 4. Physical layer codingviolations. The first framing method uses a field in the header to specify the number of bytes inthe frame. When the data linklayer atthedestination sees thebytecount, it knows how many bytes follow and hence where the end of the frame is. This technique is shown in Fig. 3-3(a) for four small example frames of sizes 5, 5, 8, and8bytes, respectively. The troublewith this algorithm is that the count can be garbled by a transmis- sion error. For example, if the byte count of 5 in the second frame of Fig. 3-3(b) becomes a 7 due to a single bit flip, the destination will get out of synchroniza- tion. It willthen beunable tolocate thecorrect start ofthenextframe. Even ifthe checksum isincorrect sothe destination knowsthat the frame isbad, itstill has no way of telling where the next frame starts. Sending a frame back to the source asking for a retransmission does not help either, since the destination does not know how many bytes to skip over to get to the start of the retransmission. For thisreason, thebytecountmethodisrarely usedbyitself. 198 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 Bytecount Onebyte 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 Frame1 Frame2 Frame3 Frame4 5bytes 5bytes 8bytes 8bytes (a) Error 5 1 2 3 4 7 6 7 8 9 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 Frame1 Frame2 Nowabyte (Wrong) count (b) Figure3-3. Abytestream.(a)Withouterrors.(b)Withoneerror. The second framing method gets around the problem of resynchronization after an error by having each frame start and end with special bytes. Often the same byte, called a flag byte, is used as both the starting and ending delimiter. This byte is shown in Fig.3-4(a) as FLAG. Two consecutive flag bytes indicate theendofoneframe andthestart ofthe next. Thus,if the receiverever loses syn- chronization it can just search for two flag bytes to find the end of the current frame andthestart ofthenextframe. However, there is a still a problem we have to solve. It may happen that the flag byte occurs in the data, especially when binary data such as photographs or songsare being transmitted. This situation would interfere with the framing. One way to solve this problem is to have the sender’s data link layer insert a special escape byte (ESC) just before each ‘‘accidental’’ flag byte in the data. Thus, a framing flag byte can be distinguished from one in the data by the absence or presence of an escape byte before it. The data link layer on the receiving end re- moves the escape bytes before giving the data to the network layer. This techni- queiscalled byte stuffing', 'Of course, the next question is: what happens if an escape byte occurs in the middle of the data? The answer is that it, too, is stuffed with an escape byte. At the receiver, the first escape byte is removed, leaving the data byte that follows it (which might be another escape byte or the flag byte). Some examples are shown in Fig. 3-4(b). In all cases, the byte sequence delivered after destuffing is exactly the same as the original byte sequence. We can still search for a frame boundary bylookingfortwoflag bytesinarow,withoutbothering toundoescapes. The byte-stuffing scheme depicted in Fig.3-4 is a slight simplification of the one used in PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), which is used to carry packets over communications links. We willdiscuss PPPnear theendofthischapter.

(a) Aframe delimitedbyflagbytes. (b)Fourexamples ofbytese- quencesbeforeandafterbytestuffing. The third method of delimiting the bit stream gets around a disadvantage of byte stuffing, which is that it is tied to the use of 8-bit bytes. Framing can be also bedoneatthe bit level, soframes can contain an arbitrary number ofbitsmade up of units of any size. It was developed for the once very popular HDLC (High- level Data Link Control) protocol. Each frame begins and ends with a special bit pattern, 01111110 or 0x7E in hexadecimal. This pattern is a flag byte. When- ever the sender’s data link layer encounters five consecutive 1s in the data, it automatically stuffs a 0 bit into the outgoing bit stream. This bit stuffing is anal- ogoustobytestuffing, inwhichanescape byte isstuffed intothe outgoing charac- ter stream before a flag byte in the data. It also ensures a minimum density of transitions that help the physical layer maintain synchronization. USB (Universal Serial Bus)usesbitstuffingforthisreason. When the receiver sees five consecutive incoming 1 bits, followed by a 0 bit, it automatically destuffs (i.e., deletes) the 0bit. Justasbytestuffing iscompletely transparent to the network layer in both computers, so is bit stuffing. If the user data contain the flag pattern, 01111110, this flag is transmitted as 011111010 but stored in the receiver’s memory as 01111110. Figure 3-5 gives an example of bit stuffing. With bit stuffing, the boundary between two frames can be unambiguously recognized by the flag pattern. Thus, if the receiver loses track of where it is, all ithastodoisscan the inputforflag sequences, since they can onlyoccur at frame boundariesandnever within thedata. 200 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 (a) 011011111111111111110010 (b) 011011111011111011111010010 Stuffedbits (c) 011011111111111111110010 Figure3-5. Bitstuffing. (a)The original data. (b)The data as they appear on the line. (c)The data as they are stored in the receiver’s memory after destuf- fing. With both bit and byte stuffing, a side effect is that the length of a frame now depends on the contents of the data it carries', 'For instance, if there are no flag bytes in the data, 100 bytes might be carried in a frame of roughly 100 bytes. If, however, the data consists solely of flag bytes, each flag byte will be escaped and the frame will become roughly 200 bytes long. With bit stuffing, the increase wouldberoughly12.5%as1bitisadded toevery byte. The last method of framing is to use a shortcut from the physical layer. We saw in Chap. 2 that the encoding of bits as signals often includes redundancy to help the receiver. This redundancy means that some signals will not occur in reg- ular data. For example, in the 4B/5B line code 4 data bits are mapped to 5 signal bits to ensure sufficient bit transitions. This means that 16 out of the 32 signal possibilities are not used. We can use some reserved signals to indicate the start and end of frames. In effect, we are using ‘‘coding violations’’ to delimit frames. The beauty of this scheme is that, because they are reserved signals, it is easy to findthestart andendofframes andthere isnoneedtostuffthedata. Many data link protocols use a combination of these methods for safety. A common pattern used for Ethernet and 802.11 is to have a frame begin with a well-defined pattern called a preamble. This pattern might be quite long (72 bits istypical for802.11)toallow the receivertoprepare foranincoming packet. The preamble is then followed by a length (i.e., count) field in the header that is used tolocate theendoftheframe. 3.1.3 Error Control Having solved the problem of marking the start and end of each frame, we come tothe next problem: howtomake sure allframes are eventually delivered to the network layer at the destination and in the proper order. Assume for the moment that the receiver can tell whether a frame that it receives contains correct or faulty information (we will look at the codes that are used to detect and correct transmission errors in Sec. 3.2). For unacknowledged connectionless service it might be fine if the sender just kept outputting frames without regard to whether SEC. 3.1 DATALINKLAYERDESIGNISSUES 201 they were arriving properly. Butforreliable, connection-orientedservice itwould notbefine atall. The usual way to ensure reliable delivery is to provide the sender with some feedback about what is happening at the other end of the line. Typically, the pro- tocol calls for the receiver to send back special control frames bearing positive or negative acknowledgements about the incoming frames. If the sender receives a positive acknowledgement about a frame, it knows the frame has arrived safely. On the other hand, a negative acknowledgement means that something has gone wrongandtheframe mustbetransmittedagain. An additional complication comes from the possibility that hardware troubles may cause a frame to vanish completely (e.g., in a noise burst). In this case, the receiver will not react at all, since it has no reason to react. Similarly, if the ac- knowledgement frame is lost, the sender will not know how to proceed', 'It should be clear that a protocol in which the sender transmits a frame and then waits for anacknowledgement,positiveor negative, willhangforever ifaframe isever lost dueto,forexample, malfunctioning hardware orafaulty communication channel. This possibility is dealt with by introducing timers into the data link layer. When the sender transmits a frame, it generally also starts a timer. The timer is set to expire after an interval long enough for the frame to reach the destination, be processed there, and have the acknowledgement propagate back to the sender. Normally, the frame will be correctly received and the acknowledgement will get back before thetimer runsout,inwhichcase thetimer willbecanceled. However, if either the frame or the acknowledgement is lost, the timer will go off, alerting the sender to a potential problem. The obvious solution is to just transmit the frame again. However, when frames may be transmitted multiple times there is a danger that the receiver will accept the same frame two or more times and pass it to the network layer more than once. To prevent this from hap- pening, it is generally necessary to assign sequence numbers to outgoing frames, sothatthereceivercan distinguishretransmissions fromoriginals. The wholeissueofmanaging thetimers andsequence numbers soas toensure that each frame is ultimately passed tothe network layer at the destination exactly once, no more and no less, is an important part of the duties of the data link layer (and higher layers). Later in this chapter, we will look at a series of increasingly sophisticatedexamples tosee howthismanagement isdone. 3.1.4 Flow Control Another important design issue that occurs in the data link layer (and higher layers as well) is what to do with a sender that systematically wants to transmit frames faster than the receiver can accept them. This situation can occur when the sender isrunningonafast, powerful computer andthereceiverisrunningona slow, low-end machine. A common situation is when a smart phone requests a Web page from a far more powerful server, which then turns on the fire hose and 202 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 blasts the data at the poor helpless phone until it is completely swamped. Even if the transmission is error free, the receiver may be unable to handle the frames as fastastheyarrive andwilllosesome. Clearly, something has to be done to prevent this situation. Two approaches are commonly used. In the first one, feedback-based flow control, the receiver sends back information to the sender giving it permission to send more data, or at least telling the sender how the receiver is doing. In the second one, rate-based flow control, the protocol has a built-in mechanism that limits the rate at which senders maytransmit data, withoutusingfeedback fromthereceiver. In this chapter we will study feedback-based flow control schemes, primarily because rate-based schemes are only seen as part of the transport layer (Chap. 5). Feedback-based schemes are seen at both the link layer and higher layers. The latter is more common these days, in which case the link layer hardware is de- signed to run fast enough that it does not cause loss', 'For example, hardware im- plementations of the link layer as NICs (Network Interface Cards) are some- times said to run at ‘‘wire speed,’’ meaning that they can handle frames as fast as they can arrive on the link. Any overruns are then not a link problem, so they are handled byhigher layers. Various feedback-based flow control schemes are known, but most of them use the same basic principle. The protocol contains well-defined rules about when a sender may transmit the next frame. These rules often prohibit frames from being sent until the receiver has granted permission, either implicitly or ex- plicitly. For example, when a connection is set up the receiver might say: ‘‘You may send me n frames now, but after they have been sent, do not send any more untilIhavetoldyoutocontinue.’’We willexamine thedetails shortly. 3.2 ERROR DETECTION AND CORRECTION We saw in Chap. 2 that communication channels have a range of charac- teristics. Some channels, like optical fiber in telecommunications networks, have tiny error rates so that transmission errors are a rare occurrence. But other chan- nels, especially wireless links and aging local loops, have error rates that are ord- ers of magnitude larger. For these links, transmission errors are the norm. They cannot be avoided at a reasonable expense or cost in terms of performance. The conclusion is that transmission errors are here to stay. We have to learn how to deal withthem. Network designers have developed two basic strategies for dealing with er- rors. Both add redundant information to the data that is sent. One strategy is to include enough redundant information to enable the receiver to deduce what the transmitted data must have been. The other is to include only enough redundancy to allow the receiver to deduce that an error has occurred (but not which error) SEC. 3.2 ERRORDETECTIONANDCORRECTION 203 and have it request a retransmission. The former strategy uses error-correcting codes and the latter uses error-detecting codes. The use of error-correcting codes isoftenreferred toasFEC(Forward Error Correction). Each of these techniques occupies a different ecological niche. On channels that are highly reliable, such as fiber, it is cheaper to use an error-detecting code andjust retransmit the occasionalblock foundtobe faulty. However, onchannels such as wireless links that make many errors, it is better to add redundancy to each block sothat the receiver is able to figure out what the originally transmitted block was. FEC is used on noisy channels because retransmissions are just as likely tobeinerror asthefirsttransmission. A key consideration for these codes is the type of errors that are likely to oc- cur. Neither error-correcting codes nor error-detecting codes can handle all pos- sible errors since the redundant bits that offer protection are as likely to be re- ceived in error as the data bits (which can compromise their protection). It would be nice if the channel treated redundant bits differently than data bits, but it does not. They are all just bits to the channel. This means that to avoid undetected er- rorsthecode mustbestrongenoughtohandle theexpected errors', 'One model is that errors are caused by extreme values of thermal noise that overwhelm the signal briefly and occasionally,givingrise toisolated single-bit er- rors. Another model is that errors tend to come in bursts rather than singly. This model follows from the physical processes that generate them—such as a deep fade onawireless channel ortransient electrical interference onawired channel/ Bothmodels matter inpractice, andtheyhave different trade-offs. Having the errors come in bursts has both advantages and disadvantages over isolated single- bit errors. On the advantage side, computer data are always sent in blocks of bits. Suppose that the block size was 1000 bits and the error rate was 0.001 per bit. If errors were independent, most blocks would contain an error. If the errors came in bursts of 100, however, only one block in 100 would be affected, on average. The disadvantage of burst errors is that when they do occur they are much harder tocorrect thanisolated errors. Other types of errors also exist. Sometimes, the location of an error will be known, perhaps because the physical layer received an analog signal that was far from the expected value for a 0 or 1 and declared the bit to be lost. This situation iscalled anerasure channel. Itiseasier tocorrect errors inerasure channels than in channels that flip bits because even if the value of the bit has been lost, at least we know which bit is inerror. However, we often donothave the benefit oferas- ures. We will examine both error-correcting codes and error-detecting codes next. Please keep two points in mind, though. First, we cover these codes in the link layer becausethisisthefirstplacethatwe have runupagainst theproblem ofreli- ably transmitting groups of bits. However, the codes are widely used because reliabilityisan overall concern. Error-correcting codes are also seen in the physi- cal layer, particularly for noisy channels, and in higher layers, particularly for 204 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 real-time media and content distribution. Error-detecting codes are commonly usedinlink,network, andtransport layers. The second point to bear in mind is that error codes are applied mathematics. Unless you are particularly adept at Galois fields or the properties of sparse matrices, you should get codes with good properties from a reliable source rather than making up your own. In fact, this is what many protocol standards do, with thesame codes comingupagain and again. Inthe material below, we willstudya simple code in detail and then briefly describe advanced codes. In this way, we can understand the trade-offs from the simple code and talk about the codes that are usedinpractice viatheadvanced codes. 3.2.1 Error-Correcting Codes We willexamine fourdifferent error-correcting codes: 1. Hamming codes. 2. Binary convolutionalcodes. 3. Reed-Solomon codes. 4. Low-Density Parity Check codes. All of these codes add redundancy to the information that is sent. A frame con- sists of m data (i.e., message) bits and r redundant (i.e. check) bits', 'In a block code, the r check bits are computed solely as a function of the m data bits with which they are associated, as though the m bits were looked up in a large table to find their corresponding r check bits. In a systematic code, the m data bits are sent directly, along with the check bits, rather than being encoded themselves be- fore they are sent. In a linear code, the r check bits are computed as a linear function of the m data bits. Exclusive OR (XOR) or modulo 2 addition is a popu- lar choice. This means that encoding can be done with operations such as matrix multiplications or simple logic circuits. The codes we will look at in this section are linear, systematic blockcodes unlessotherwise noted. Let the total length of a block be n (i.e., n =m +r). We will describe this as an (n,m) code. An n-bit unit containing data and check bits is referred to as an n- bit codeword. The code rate, or simply rate, is the fraction of the codeword that carries information that is not redundant, or m/n. The rates used in practice vary widely. They might be 1/2 for a noisy channel, in which case half of the received information is redundant, or close to 1 for a high-quality channel, with only a small number ofcheck bitsaddedtoalarge message. To understand how errors can be handled, it is necessary to first look closely at what an error really is. Given any two codewords that may be transmitted or received—say, 10001001 and 10110001—it is possible to determine how many SEC. 3.2 ERRORDETECTIONANDCORRECTION 205 corresponding bits differ. In this case, 3 bits differ. To determine how many bits differ, just XOR the two codewords and count the number of 1 bits in the result. Forexample: 10001001 10110001 00111000 The number of bit positions in which two codewords differ is called the Ham- ming distance (Hamming, 1950). Its significance is that if two codewords are a Hamming distance d apart, it will require d single-bit errors to convert one into theother. Given the algorithm for computing the check bits, it is possible to construct a complete list of the legal codewords, and from this list to find the two codewords with the smallest Hamming distance. This distance is the Hamming distance of thecomplete code. In most data transmission applications, all 2m possible data messages are legal, but due to the way the check bits are computed, not all of the 2n possible codewords are used. In fact, when there are r check bits, only the small fraction of 2m/2n or 1/2r of the possible messages will be legal codewords. It is the sparseness withwhich themessage isembedded inthespaceofcodewords that al- lowsthereceivertodetect andcorrect errors. The error-detecting and error-correcting properties of a block code depend on its Hamming distance. To reliably detect derrors, youneed a distance d +1code because with such a code there is no way that d single-bit errors can change a valid codeword into another valid codeword', 'When the receiver sees an illegal codeword, itcan tellthatatransmission errorhasoccurred. Similarly, tocorrect d errors, you need a distance 2d +1 code because that way the legal codewords are so far apart that even with d changes the original codeword is still closer than any other codeword. This means the original codeword can be uniquely determined based ontheassumption thatalarger numberoferrors are lesslikely. As a simple example of an error-correcting code, consider a code with only fourvalidcodewords: 0000000000, 0000011111, 1111100000, and1111111111 This code has a distance of 5, which means that it can correct double errors or detect quadruple errors. If the codeword 0000000111 arrives and we expect only single- or double-bit errors, the receiver will know that the original must have been 0000011111. If, however, a triple error changes 0000000000 into 0000000111, the error will not be corrected properly. Alternatively, if we expect all of these errors, we can detect them. None of the received codewords are legal codewords so an error must have occurred. It should be apparent that in this ex- ample we cannot both correct double errors and detect quadruple errors because thiswouldrequire ustointerpret areceivedcodeword intwodifferent ways. 206 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 In our example, the task of decoding by finding the legal codeword that is closest to the received codeword can be done byinspection. Unfortunately, in the most general case where all codewords need to be evaluated as candidates, this task can be atime-consuming search. Instead, practical codes are designed sothat theyadmit shortcuts tofindwhatwas likelytheoriginal codeword. Imagine that we want to design a code with m message bits and r check bits that willallow all single errors tobe corrected. Each ofthe2m legal messages has nillegalcodewords at adistance of1from it. These are formed bysystematically inverting each of the n bits in the n-bit codeword formed from it. Thus, each of the 2m legal messages requires n +1 bit patterns dedicated to it. Since the total number of bit patterns is 2n, we must have (n +1)2m ≤2n. Using n =m +r, this requirement becomes (m +r +1)≤2r (3-1) Givenm,thisputsalower limit onthe number ofcheck bits needed tocorrect sin- gleerrors. This theoretical lower limit can, in fact, be achieved using a method due to Hamming (1950). In Hamming codes the bits of the codeword are numbered consecutively, starting withbit1attheleft end,bit2toitsimmediate right,andso on. The bits that are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) are check bits. The rest (3, 5, 6, 7, 9, etc.) are filled up with the m data bits. This pattern is shown for an (11,7) Hamming code with 7data bitsand4check bitsinFig.3-6. Each check bit forces the modulo 2 sum, or parity, of some collection of bits, including itself, to be even (or odd). A bit may be included in several check bit computations. To see which check bits the data bit inposition k contributes to, rewrite k as a sum of powers of 2. For example, 11 = 1 + 2 + 8 and 29 = 1 + 4 + 8 + 16', 'A bit is checked byjust those check bits occurring in its expansion (e.g., bit 11 is checked by bits 1, 2, and 8).

Exampleofan(11,7)Hammingcodecorrectingasingle-biterror. This construction gives a code with a Hamming distance of 3, which means that it can correct single errors (or detect double errors). The reason for the very careful numbering of message and check bits becomes apparent in the decoding SEC. 3.2 ERRORDETECTIONANDCORRECTION 207 process. When a codeword arrives, the receiver redoes the check bit computa- tions including the values of the received check bits. We call these the check re- sults. If the check bits are correct then, for even parity sums, each check result shouldbezero. Inthiscase thecodeword isacceptedasvalid. If the check results are not all zero, however, an error has been detected. The set of check results forms the error syndrome that is used topinpoint and correct the error. In Fig.3-6, a single-bit error occurred on the channel so the check re- sults are 0, 1, 0, and 1 for k = 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively. This gives a syndrome of 0101or 4+1=5. By the design of the scheme, this means that the fifth bit is in error. Flipping the incorrect bit (which might be a check bit or a data bit) and dis- carding thecheck bitsgivesthecorrect message ofanASCII ‘‘A.’’ Hamming distances are valuable for understanding block codes, and Ham- ming codes are used in error-correcting memory. However, most networks use stronger codes. The second code we will look at is a convolutional code. This code is the only one we will cover that is not a block code. In a convolutional code, an encoder processes a sequence of input bits and generates a sequence of output bits. There is no natural message size or encoding boundary as in a block code. The output depends on the current and previous input bits. That is, the encoder has memory. The numberofprevious bitsonwhich theoutputdepends is called the constraint length of the code. Convolutional codes are specified in terms oftheir rate andconstraint length. Convolutional codes are widely used in deployed networks, for example, as part ofthe GSM mobile phonesystem, insatellitecommunications, andin802.11. As an example, a popular convolutional code is shown in Fig.3-7. This code is known as the NASA convolutional code of r =1/2 and k =7, since it was first used for the Voyager space missions starting in 1977. Since then it has been liberally reused, forexample, aspartof802.11. Output bit1 Input S S S S S S bit 1 2 3 4 5 6 Output bit2 Figure3-7. TheNASAbinaryconvolutionalcodeusedin802.11. InFig.3-7,eachinputbitontheleft-hand sideproducestwooutputbitsonthe right-hand side that are XOR sums of the input and internal state', 'Since it deals with bits and performs linear operations, this is a binary, linear convolutional code. Since 1 input bit produces 2 output bits, the code rate is 1/2. It is not sys- tematic since noneoftheoutputbitsissimplytheinputbit. 208 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 The internal state is kept in six memory registers. Each time another bit is in- put the values in the registers are shifted to the right. For example, if 111 is input andthe initialstate is all zeros, the internal state, written left to right, will become 100000, 110000,and111000after the first, second,andthird bitshave been input. The output bits will be 11, followed by 10, and then 01. It takes seven shifts to flush an input completely so that it does not affect the output. The constraint lengthofthiscode isthusk =7. A convolutional code is decoded by finding the sequence of input bits that is mostlikely tohave producedtheobserved sequence ofoutputbits(which includes any errors). For small values of k, this is done with a widely used algorithm de- veloped by Viterbi (Forney, 1973). The algorithm walks the observed sequence, keeping for each step and for each possible internal state the input sequence that would have produced the observed sequence with the fewest errors. The input se- quence requiring thefewest errors attheendisthemostlikely message. Convolutional codes have been popular in practice because it is easy to factor the uncertainty of a bit being a 0 or a 1 into the decoding. For example, suppose −1V is the logical 0 level and +1V is the logical 1 level, we might receive 0.9V and −0.1V for 2 bits. Instead of mapping these signals to 1 and 0 right away, we would like to treat 0.9V as ‘‘very likely a 1’’ and −0.1V as ‘‘maybe a 0’’ and cor- rect the sequence as a whole. Extensions of the Viterbi algorithm can work with these uncertainties to provide stronger error correction. This approach of working with the uncertainty of a bit is called soft-decision decoding. Conversely, decid- ing whether each bit is a 0 or a 1 before subsequent error correction is called hard-decision decoding. The third kind of error-correcting code we will describe is the Reed-Solomon code. Like Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes are linear block codes, and they are often systematic too. Unlike Hamming codes, which operate on individ- ual bits, Reed-Solomon codes operate on m bit symbols. Naturally, the mathemat- icsare more involved,sowewilldescribe their operation byanalogy. Reed-Solomon codes are based on the fact that every n degree polynomial is uniquely determined by n +1 points. For example, a line having the form ax +b isdetermined bytwo points. Extra points onthe same line are redundant,which is helpful for error correction. Imagine that we have two data points that represent a line and we send those two data points plus two check points chosen to lie on the same line. If one of the points is received in error, we can still recover the data points by fitting a line to the received points. Three of the points will lie on the line, and one point, the one in error, will not', 'By finding the line we have cor- rected theerror. Reed-Solomon codes are actually defined as polynomials that operate over finite fields, but they work in a similar manner. For m bit symbols, the codewords are 2m−1 symbols long. A popular choice is to make m =8 so that symbols are bytes. A codeword is then 255 bytes long. The (255, 233) code is widely used; it adds 32 redundant symbols to 233 data symbols. Decoding with error correction SEC. 3.2 ERRORDETECTIONANDCORRECTION 209 is done with an algorithm developed by Berlekamp and Massey that can effi- ciently perform thefittingtask formoderate-length codes (Massey, 1969). Reed-Solomon codes are widely used in practice because of their strong error-correction properties, particularly for burst errors. They are used for DSL, data over cable, satellite communications, and perhaps most ubiquitously on CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. Because they are based on m bit symbols, a single-bit error and an m-bit burst error are both treated simply as one symbol error. When 2t redundant symbols are added, a Reed-Solomon code is able to correct up to t errors in any of the transmitted symbols. This means, for example, that the (255, 233) code, which has 32 redundant symbols, can correct up to 16 symbol errors. Since the symbols may be consecutive and they are each 8 bits, an error burst of up to 128 bits can be corrected. The situation is even better if the error model is one of erasures (e.g., a scratch on a CD that obliterates some symbols). In this case, upto2terrors can becorrected. Reed-Solomon codes are often usedincombination withother codes such as a convolutional code. The thinking is as follows. Convolutional codes are effective at handling isolated bit errors, but they will fail, likely with a burst of errors, if there are too many errors in the received bit stream. By adding a Reed-Solomon code within the convolutional code, the Reed-Solomon decoding can mop up the error bursts, a task at which it is very good. The overall code then provides good protection against bothsingle andbursterrors. The final error-correcting code we will cover is the LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) code. LDPC codes are linear block codes that were invented by Robert Gallagher in his doctoral thesis (Gallagher, 1962). Like most theses, they were promptly forgotten, onlytobereinvented in1995when advances incomput- ingpower hadmade thempractical. In an LDPC code, each output bit is formed from only a fraction of the input bits. This leads to a matrix representation of the code that has a low density of 1s, hence the name for the code. The received codewords are decoded with an approximation algorithm that iteratively improves on a best fit of the received data toalegal codeword. Thiscorrects errors. LDPC codes are practical for large block sizes and have excellent error-cor- rection abilities that outperform many other codes (including the ones we have looked at) in practice. For this reason they are rapidly being included in new pro- tocols. They are part of the standard for digital video broadcasting, 10 Gbps Ethernet, power-line networks, and the latest version of 802.11', 'Expect to see more oftheminfuture networks. 3.2.2 Error-Detecting Codes Error-correcting codes are widely used on wireless links, which are notori- ously noisy and error prone when compared to optical fibers. Without error-cor- recting codes, it would be hard to get anything through. However, over fiber or 210 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 high-quality copper, the error rate is much lower, so error detection and retrans- missionisusually more efficient there fordealing withtheoccasionalerror. We will examine three different error-detecting codes. They are all linear, systematic blockcodes: 1. Parity. 2. Checksums. 3. Cyclic RedundancyChecks (CRCs). To see how they can be more efficient than error-correcting codes, consider the first error-detecting code, in which a single parity bit is appended tothe data. The parity bit is chosen so that the number of 1 bits in the codeword is even (or odd). Doing this is equivalent to computing the (even) parity bit as the modulo 2 sumorXOR ofthe data bits. Forexample, when 1011010issent ineven parity, a bit is added to the end to make it 10110100. With odd parity 1011010 becomes 10110101. A code with a single parity bit has a distance of 2, since any single-bit error produces a codeword with the wrong parity. This means that it can detect single-bit errors. Consider a channel on which errors are isolated and the error rate is 10 −6 per bit. This may seem a tiny error rate, but it is at best a fair rate for a long wired cable that is challenging for error detection. Typical LAN links provide bit error rates of 10 −10. Let the block size be 1000 bits. To provide error correction for 1000-bit blocks, we know from Eq.(3-1) that 10 check bits are needed. Thus, a megabit of data would require 10,000check bits. To merely detect a block with a single 1-bit error, one parity bit per block will suffice. Once every 1000 blocks, a block will be found to be in error and an extra block (1001 bits) will have to be transmitted to repair the error. The total overhead for the error detection and re- transmission methodisonly2001bits per megabit ofdata, versus 10,000bitsfora Hamming code. One difficulty with this scheme is that a single parity bit can only reliably detect a single-bit error in the block. If the block is badly garbled by a long burst error, the probabilitythat the error willbedetected isonly0.5,which ishardly ac- ceptable. The odds can be improved considerably if each block to be sent is regarded as a rectangular matrix n bits wide and k bits high. Now, if we compute and send one parity bit for each row, up to k bit errors will be reliably detected as longasthere isatmostoneerrorperrow. However, there is something else we can do that provides better protection against burst errors: we can compute the parity bits over the data in a different order than the order in which the data bits are transmitted. Doing so is called interleaving', 'In this case, we will compute a parity bit for each of the n columns and send all the data bits as k rows, sending the rows from top to bottom and the bits in each row from left to right in the usual manner. At the last row, we send thenparity bits. Thistransmission orderisshowninFig.3-8forn =7andk =7.

Interleavingofparitybitstodetectabursterror. Interleaving is a general technique to convert a code that detects (or corrects) isolated errors into a code that detects (or corrects) burst errors. In Fig.3-8, when a burst error of length n =7 occurs, the bits that are in error are spread across dif- ferent columns. (A burst error does not imply that all the bits are wrong; it just implies that at least the first and last are wrong. In Fig. 3-8, 4 bits were flipped over a range of 7bits.) At most 1bit in each of the ncolumns willbeaffected, so the parity bits on those columns will detect the error. This method uses n parity bitsonblocksofkndata bitstodetect asingle bursterror oflengthnorless. A burst of length n +1 will pass undetected, however, if the first bit is inverted, the last bit is inverted, and all the other bits are correct. If the block is badlygarbled byalongburstorbymultipleshorter bursts,the probabilitythat any of the n columns will have the correct parity by accident is 0.5, so the probability ofabadblockbeingacceptedwhen itshouldnotbeis2 −n. The second kind of error-detecting code, the checksum, is closely related to groups of parity bits. The word ‘‘checksum’’ is often used to mean a group of check bits associated with a message, regardless of how are calculated. A group of parity bits is one example of a checksum. However, there are other, stronger checksums based ona running sum of the data bits of the message. The checksum is usually placed at the end of the message, as the complement of the sum func- tion. This way, errors may be detected by summing the entire received codeword, both data bits and checksum. If the result comes out to be zero, noerror has been detected. One example of a checksum is the 16-bit Internet checksum used on all Inter- net packets as part of the IP protocol (Braden et al., 1988). This checksum is a sum of the message bits divided into 16-bit words. Because this method operates on words rather than on bits, as in parity, errors that leave the parity unchanged can still alter the sum and be detected. For example, if the lowest order bit in two different words is flipped from a 0 to a 1, a parity check across these bits would fail to detect an error. However, two 1s will be added to the 16-bit checksum to produceadifferent result. The errorcan thenbedetected. 212 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP', '3 The Internet checksum iscomputed inone’s complement arithmetic instead of as the modulo 216 sum. In one’s complement arithmetic, anegative number isthe bitwise complement of its positive counterpart. Modern computers run two’s complement arithmetic, in which a negative number is the one’s complement plus one. On a two’s complement computer, the one’s complement sum is equivalent to taking the sum modulo 216 and adding any overflow of the high order bits back into the low-order bits. This algorithm gives a more uniform coverage of the data by the checksum bits. Otherwise, two high-order bits can be added, overflow, and be lost without changing the sum. There is another benefit, too. One’s comple- ment has tworepresentations ofzero, all 0sandall1s.Thisallows onevalue (e.g., all0s)toindicate thatthere isnochecksum, withouttheneed foranother field. For decades,ithas always been assumed that frames to be checksummed con- tain randombits. All analyses ofchecksum algorithms have been made underthis assumption. Inspection of real data by Partridge et al. (1995) has shown this as- sumption to be quite wrong. As a consequence, undetected errors are in some cases muchmorecommonthanhadbeenpreviously thought. The Internet checksum in particular is efficient and simple but provides weak protection in some cases precisely because it is a simple sum. It does not detect the deletion or addition of zero data, nor swapping parts of the message, and it provides weak protection against message splices in which parts of two packets are put together. These errors may seem very unlikely to occur by random proc- esses, buttheyare justthesortoferrors thatcanoccur withbuggyhardware. A better choice is Fletcher’s checksum (Fletcher, 1982). It includes a posi- tional component, adding the product of the data and its position to the running sum.Thisprovidesstrongerdetection ofchanges inthepositionofdata. Although the two preceding schemes may sometimes be adequate at higher layers, in practice, a third and stronger kind of error-detecting code is in wide- spread use at the link layer: the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), also known as a polynomial code. Polynomial codes are based upon treating bit strings as representations of polynomials with coefficients of 0 and 1 only. A k-bit frame is regarded as the coefficient list for a polynomial with k terms, ranging from xk−1 to x0. Such a polynomial is said to be of degree k −1. The high-order (leftmost) bit is the coefficient of xk−1, the next bit is the coefficient of xk−2, and so on. For example, 110001 has 6 bits and thus represents a six-term polynomial with coefficients 1,1,0,0,0,and1:1x5 +1x4 +0x3 +0x2 +0x1 +1x0. Polynomial arithmetic is done modulo 2, according to the rules of algebraic field theory. It does not have carries for addition or borrows for subtraction. Both additionandsubtraction are identical toexclusive OR. Forexample: 10011011 00110011 11110000 01010101 +11001010 +11001101 −10100110 −10101111 01010001 11111110 01010110 11111010 Long division is carried out in exactly the same way as it is in binary except that SEC. 3.2 ERRORDETECTIONANDCORRECTION 213 the subtraction is again done modulo 2. A divisor is said ‘‘to go into’’ a dividend ifthedividendhasasmanybitsasthedivisor', 'When the polynomial code method is employed, the sender and receiver must agree upon a generator polynomial, G(x), in advance. Both the high- and low- order bits of the generator must be 1. To compute the CRC for some frame with m bits corresponding to the polynomial M(x), the frame must be longer than the generator polynomial. The idea is to append a CRC to the end of the frame in such a way that the polynomial represented by the checksummed frame is divisi- ble by G(x). When the receiver gets the checksummed frame, it tries dividing it byG(x). Ifthere isaremainder, there hasbeenatransmission error. The algorithm forcomputing theCRCisasfollows: 1. Let r be the degree of G(x). Append r zero bits to the low-order end of the frame so it now contains m +r bits and corresponds to the polynomialxrM(x). 2. Divide the bit string corresponding to G(x) into the bit string corres- pondingtoxrM(x),usingmodulo2division. 3. Subtract the remainder (which is always r or fewer bits) from the bit string corresponding to xrM(x) using modulo 2 subtraction. The re- sultisthechecksummed frame tobetransmitted. Call its polynomial T(x). Figure 3-9 illustrates the calculation for a frame 1101011111 using the generator G(x)=x4 +x +1. It should be clear that T(x) is divisible (modulo 2) by G(x). In any division problem, if youdiminish the dividend bythe remainder, what isleft over isdivisi- ble by the divisor. For example, in base 10, if you divide 210,278 by 10,941, the remainder is 2399. If you then subtract 2399 from 210,278, what is left over (207,879)isdivisible by10,941. Nowletusanalyze thepower ofthismethod. What kindsoferrors willbede- tected? Imagine that a transmission error occurs, so that instead of the bit string for T(x) arriving, T(x)+E(x) arrives. Each 1bit in E(x) corresponds to a bit that has been inverted. If there are k 1 bits in E(x), k single-bit errors have occurred. A single burst error is characterized by an initial 1, a mixture of 0s and 1s, and a final 1,withallotherbitsbeing0. Upon receiving the checksummed frame, the receiver divides it by G(x); that is, it computes [T(x)+E(x)]/G(x). T(x)/G(x) is 0, so the result of the computa- tion is simply E(x)/G(x). Those errors that happen to correspond to polynomials containing G(x)asafactor willslipby;allothererrors willbecaught. If there has been a single-bit error, E(x)=xi, where i determines which bit is in error. If G(x) contains two or more terms, it will never divide into E(x), so all single-bit errors willbedetected. 214 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP', '3 Frame: 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 Generator: 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 Quotient(thrownaway) 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 Framewithfourzerosappended 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Remainder Transmittedframe: 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 Framewithfourzerosappended minusremainder Figure3-9. ExamplecalculationoftheCRC. If there have been two isolated single-bit errors, E(x)=xi +xj, where i > j. Alternatively, this can be written as E(x)=xj(xi−j +1). If we assume that G(x) is not divisible by x, a sufficient condition for all double errors to be detected is that G(x) does not divide xk +1 for any k up to the maximum value of i − j (i.e., upto the maximum frame length). Simple, low-degree polynomials that give pro- tection to long frames are known. For example, x15 +x14 +1 will not divide xk +1foranyvalue ofkbelow32,768. If there are an odd number of bits in error, E(X) contains an odd number of terms (e.g., x5 +x2 +1, butnotx2 +1). Interestingly, nopolynomialwith anodd number of terms has x +1 as a factor in the modulo 2 system. By making x +1 a factor ofG(x), wecan catch allerrors withanoddnumberofinverted bits. Finally, and importantly, a polynomial code with r check bits will detect all burst errors of length ≤r. A burst error of length k can be represented by xi(xk−1 +...+1), where i determines how far from the right-hand end of the re- ceived frame the burst is located. If G(x) contains an x0 term, it will not have xi as a factor, so if the degree of the parenthesized expression is less than the degree ofG(x), theremainder can never bezero. SEC. 3.2 ERRORDETECTIONANDCORRECTION 215 If the burst length is r +1, the remainder of the division by G(x) will be zero if and only if the burst is identical to G(x). By definition of a burst, the first and last bits must be 1, so whether it matches depends on the r −1 intermediate bits. Ifall combinations are regarded as equally likely, the probabilityofsuchanincor- rect frame beingacceptedasvalidis½r−1. It can also be shown that when an error burst longer than r +1 bits occurs or when several shorter bursts occur, the probability of a bad frame getting through unnoticedis½r,assumingthatallbitpatterns are equally likely.

It has been used widely since the 1980s. However, this does not mean it is the best choice. Using an exhaustive computational search, Castagnoli et al. (1993)and Koopman(2002) found the best CRCs. These CRCs have a Hamming distance of 6 for typical message sizes, while the IEEE standard CRC-32 has a Hamming distance of only 4. Although the calculation required to compute the CRC may seem complicat- ed, it is easy to compute and verify CRCs in hardware with simple shift register circuits (Peterson and Brown, 1961). In practice, this hardware is nearly always used. Dozens of networking standards include various CRCs, including virtually all LANs (e.g., Ethernet, 802.11) and point-to-point links (e.g., packets over SONET). 3.3 ELEMENTARY DATA LINK PROTOCOLS To introduce the subject of protocols, we will begin by looking at three proto- cols of increasing complexity. For interested readers, a simulator for these and subsequent protocols is available via the Web (see the preface). Before we look at the protocols, it is useful to make explicit some of the assumptions underlying themodelofcommunication. To start with, we assume that the physical layer, data link layer, and network layer are independent processes that communicate by passing messages back and forth. Acommon implementation is shown in Fig.3-10. The physical layer proc- ess and some ofthe data link layer process runondedicate hardware called aNIC (Network Interface Card). The rest of the link layer process and the network layer process run on the main CPU as part of the operating system, with the soft- ware for the link layer process often taking the form of a device driver. Howev- er, other implementations are also possible (e.g., three processes offloaded toded- icated hardware called a network accelerator, or three processes running on the 216 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 main CPU on a software-defined ratio). Actually, the preferred implementation changes from decade to decade with technology trade-offs. In any event, treating the three layers as separate processes makes the discussion conceptually cleaner andalsoserves toemphasize theindependence ofthelayers. Computer Application Operatingsystem Network Driver Link NetworkInterface Link Card(NIC) PHY Cable(medium) Figure3-10. Implementationofthephysical,datalink,andnetworklayers. Another key assumption isthat machine A wants tosend a longstream of data tomachine B,usingareliable, connection-orientedservice. Later, wewillconsid- er the case where B also wants to send data to A simultaneously. A is assumed to have an infinite supply of data ready to send and never has to wait for data to be produced. Instead, when A’s data link layer asks for data, the network layer is al- ways able tocomplyimmediately. (This restriction, too,willbedroppedlater.) We alsoassume thatmachines donotcrash. That is, these protocols deal with communication errors, but not the problems caused by computers crashing and rebooting', 'As far as the data link layer is concerned, the packet passed across the inter- face to it from the network layer is pure data, whose every bit istobe delivered to the destination’s network layer. The fact that the destination’s network layer may interpret part ofthepacket asaheader isofnoconcern tothedata linklayer. When the data link layer accepts a packet, it encapsulates the packet in a frame by adding a data link header and trailer to it (see Fig.3-1). Thus, a frame consists of an embedded packet, some control information (in the header), and a checksum (in the trailer). The frame is then transmitted to the data link layer on the other machine. We will assume that there exist suitable library procedures to physical layer to send a frame and from physical layer to receive a frame. These procedures compute and append or check the checksum (which is usually done in hardware) so that we donotneed toworryaboutit as part ofthe protocols we develop in this section. They might use the CRC algorithm discussed in the previoussection, forexample. Initially, the receiver has nothing to do. It just sits around waiting for some- thing tohappen. Intheexample protocols throughoutthischapter wewillindicate that the data link layer is waiting for something to happen by the procedure call SEC. 3.3 ELEMENTARYDATALINKPROTOCOLS 217 #defineMAX PKT1024 /*determinespacketsizeinbytes*/ typedefenum{false,true}boolean; /*booleantype*/ typedefunsignedintseq nr; /*sequenceoracknumbers*/ typedefstruct{unsignedchardata[MAX PKT];}packet; /*packetdefinition*/ typedefenum{data,ack,nak}frame kind; /*frame kinddefinition*/ typedefstruct{ /*framesaretransportedinthislayer*/ frame kindkind; /*whatkindofframeisit?*/ seq nrseq; /*sequencenumber*/ seq nrack; /*acknowledgementnumber*/ packetinfo; /*thenetworklayerpacket*/ }frame; /*Waitforaneventtohappen;returnitstypeinevent.*/ voidwait for event(event type*event); /*Fetchapacketfromthenetworklayerfortransmissiononthechannel.*/ voidfrom network layer(packet*p); /*Deliverinformationfromaninboundframetothenetworklayer.*/ voidto network layer(packet*p); /*Gogetaninboundframefromthephysicallayerandcopyittor.*/ voidfrom physical layer(frame*r); /*Passtheframetothephysicallayerfortransmission.*/ voidto physical layer(frame*s); /*Starttheclockrunningandenablethetimeoutevent.*/ voidstart timer(seq nrk); /*Stoptheclockanddisablethetimeoutevent.*/ voidstop timer(seq nrk); /*Startanauxiliarytimerandenabletheack timeoutevent.*/ voidstart ack timer(void); /*Stoptheauxiliarytimeranddisabletheack timeoutevent.*/ voidstop ack timer(void); /*Allowthenetworklayertocauseanetwork layer readyevent.*/ voidenable network layer(void); /*Forbidthenetworklayerfromcausinganetwork layer readyevent.*/ voiddisable network layer(void); /*Macroincisexpandedin-line:incrementkcircularly. */ #defineinc(k)if(k<MAX SEQ)k=k+1;elsek=0 Figure3-11. Some definitionsneeded in the protocols to follow. These defini- tionsarelocatedinthefileprotocol.h. 218 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 wait for event(&event). This procedure only returns when something has hap- pened (e.g., a frame has arrived). Upon return, the variable event tells what hap- pened. The set of possible events differs for the various protocols to be described and will be defined separately for each protocol. Note that in a more realistic situation, the data link layer will not sit in a tight loop waiting for an event, as we have suggested, but will receive an interrupt, which will cause it to stop whatever it was doing and go handle the incoming frame. Nevertheless, for simplicity we will ignore all the details of parallel activity within the data link layer and assume thatitisdedicated fulltime tohandlingjustouronechannel. When a frame arrives at the receiver, the checksum is recomputed. If the checksum in the frame is incorrect (i.e., there was a transmission error), the data link layer is so informed (event =cksum err). If the inbound frame arrived undamaged, the data link layer is also informed (event = frame arrival) so that it can acquire the frame for inspection using from physical layer', 'As soon as the receiving data link layer has acquired an undamaged frame, it checks the control information in the header, and, if everything is all right, passes the packet portion to the network layer. Under no circumstances is a frame header ever given to a network layer. There isa goodreason why the network layer must never be given any part of the frame header: to keep the network and data link protocols completely sepa- rate. As long as the network layer knows nothing at all about the data link proto- col or the frame format, these things can be changed without requiring changes to the network layer’s software. This happens whenever a new NIC is installed in a computer. Providing a rigid interface between the network and data link layers greatly simplifies the design task because communication protocols in different layers can evolve independently. Figure 3-11 shows some declarations (in C) common to many of the protocols to be discussed later. Five data structures are defined there: boolean, seq nr, packet, frame kind, and frame. A boolean is an enumerated type and can take on the values true and false. A seq nr is a small integer used to number the frames so that we can tell them apart. These sequence numbers run from 0 up to and in- cluding MAX SEQ, which is defined in each protocol needing it. A packet is the unit of information exchanged between the network layer and the data link layer on the same machine, or between network layer peers. In our model it always contains MAX PKT bytes, butmore realistically itwouldbeofvariable length. A frame is composed of four fields: kind, seq, ack, and info, the first three of which contain control information andthelastofwhich maycontain actual data to betransferred. These control fields are collectively called theframe header. The kind field tells whether there are any data in the frame, because some of the protocols distinguish frames containing only control information from those containing data as well. The seq and ack fields are used for sequence numbers and acknowledgements, respectively; their use will be described in more detail later. The info field of a data frame contains a single packet; the info field of a SEC. 3.3 ELEMENTARYDATALINKPROTOCOLS 219 control frame is not used. A more realistic implementation would use a variable- lengthinfofield, omittingitaltogether forcontrol frames. Again, it is important to understand the relationship between a packet and a frame. The network layer builds a packet by taking a message from the transport layer and adding the network layer header to it. This packet is passed to the data link layer for inclusion in the info field of an outgoing frame. When the frame ar- rives at the destination, the data link layer extracts the packet from the frame and passes the packet to the network layer. In this manner, the network layer can act asthoughmachines can exchange packets directly. A number of procedures are also listed in Fig.3-11', 'These are library rou- tines whose details are implementation dependent and whose inner workings will notconcern usfurther inthefollowing discussions. The procedure wait for event sits in a tight loop waiting for something to happen, as mentioned earlier. The procedures to network layer and from network layer are used by the data link layer to pass packets to the network layer and accept packets from the network layer, respectively. Note that from physical layer and to physical layer pass frames between the data link layer and the physical layer. In other words, to net- work layer and from network layer deal with the interface between layers 2 and 3, whereas from physical layer and to physical layer deal with the interface be- tween layers 1and2. In most of the protocols, we assume that the channel is unreliable and loses entire frames upon occasion. To be able to recover from such calamities, the sending data link layer must start an internal timer or clock whenever it sends a frame. If no reply has been received within a certain predetermined time interval, theclock times outandthedata linklayer receivesaninterrupt signal. In our protocols this is handled by allowing the procedure wait for event to return event =timeout. The procedures start timer and stop timer turn the timer on and off, respectively. Timeout events are possible only when the timer is run- ning and before stop timer is called. It is explicitly permitted to call start timer while the timer is running; such a call simply resets the clock to cause the next timeout after afulltimer interval haselapsed (unless itisreset orturned off). The procedures start ack timer andstop ack timer control an auxiliary timer usedtogenerate acknowledgementsundercertain conditions. The procedures enable network layer and disable network layer are used in the more sophisticated protocols, where we no longer assume that the network layer always has packets to send. When the data link layer enables the network layer, the network layer is then permitted to interrupt when it has a packet to be sent. We indicate this with event =network layer ready. When the network layer is disabled, it may not cause such events. By being careful about when it enables and disables its network layer, the data link layer can prevent the network layer fromswamping itwithpackets forwhichithasnobuffer space. Frame sequence numbers are always in the range 0 to MAX SEQ (inclusive), where MAX SEQ isdifferent forthedifferent protocols. Itisfrequently necessary 220 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 to advance a sequence number by 1 circularly (i.e., MAX SEQ is followed by 0). The macro inc performs this incrementing. It has been defined as a macro be- cause it is used in-line within the critical path. As we will see later, the factor limiting network performance is often protocol processing, so defining simple op- erations likethisas macros does notaffect the readabilityofthe code butdoes im- proveperformance. The declarations of Fig.3-11 are part of each of the protocols we will discuss shortly', 'To save space and to provide a convenient reference, they have been extracted and listed together, but conceptually they should be merged with the protocols themselves. In C, this merging is done by putting the definitions in a special header file, in this case protocol.h, and using the #include facility of the C preprocessor toinclude themintheprotocol files. 3.3.1 A Utopian Simplex Protocol As an initial example we will consider a protocol that is as simple as it can be because it does notworry aboutthe possibility of anything going wrong. Data are transmitted in one direction only. Both the transmitting and receiving network layers are always ready. Processing time can be ignored. Infinite buffer space is available. And best of all, the communication channel between the data link lay- ers never damages or loses frames. This thoroughly unrealistic protocol, which we will nickname ‘‘Utopia,’’ is simply to show the basic structure on which we willbuild. It’simplementation isshowninFig.3-12. The protocol consists of two distinct procedures, a sender and a receiver. The sender runs in the data link layer of the source machine, and the receiver runs in the data link layer of the destination machine. No sequence numbers or acknowl- edgements are used here, so MAX SEQ is not needed. The only event type pos- sible isframe arrival (i.e., thearrival ofanundamagedframe). The sender is in an infinite while loop just pumping data out onto the line as fast as it can. The body of the loop consists of three actions: go fetch a packet from the (always obliging) network layer, construct an outbound frame using the variable s, and send the frame on its way. Only the info field of the frame is used by this protocol, because the other fields have to do with error and flow control andthere are noerrors orflowcontrol restrictions here. The receiver is equally simple. Initially, it waits for something to happen, the only possibility being the arrival of an undamaged frame. Eventually, the frame arrives and the procedure wait for event returns, with event set to frame arrival (which is ignored anyway). The call to from physical layer removes the newly arrived frame from the hardware buffer and puts it in the variable r, where the re- ceiver code can get at it. Finally, the data portion is passed on to the network layer, and the data link layer settles back to wait for the next frame, effectively suspendingitself untiltheframe arrives.

Autopiansimplexprotocol. The utopia protocol is unrealistic because it does not handle either flow con- trol or error correction. Its processing is close to that of an unacknowledged con- nectionless service that relies on higher layers to solve these problems, though even anunacknowledgedconnectionlessservice woulddosomeerrordetection', '3.3.2 A Simplex Stop-and-Wait Protocol for an Error-Free Channel Now we will tackle the problem of preventing the sender from flooding the receiver with frames faster than the latter is able to process them. This situation can easily happen in practice so being able to prevent it is of great importance. 222 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 The communication channel is still assumed to be error free, however, and the data traffic isstillsimplex. One solution is to build the receiver to be powerful enough to process a con- tinuousstream ofback-to-back frames (or,equivalently, define thelinklayer tobe slow enough that the receiver can keep up). It must have sufficient buffering and processing abilities to run at the line rate and must be able to pass the frames that are received to the network layer quickly enough. However, this is a worst-case solution. It requires dedicated hardware and can be wasteful of resources if the utilization of the link is mostly low. Moreover, it just shifts the problem of deal- ingwithasender thatistoofastelsewhere; inthiscase tothenetwork layer. A more general solution to this problem is to have the receiver provide feed- back to the sender. After having passed a packet toits network layer, the receiver sends a little dummy frame back to the sender which, in effect, gives the sender permission totransmit the next frame. After having sent a frame, the sender isre- quired by the protocol to bide its time until the little dummy (i.e., acknowledge- ment) frame arrives. Thisdelay isasimple example ofaflowcontrol protocol. Protocols in which the sender sends one frame and then waits for an acknowl- edgement before proceeding are called stop-and-wait. Figure 3-13 gives an ex- ample ofasimplex stop-and-wait protocol. Althoughdata traffic inthisexample issimplex, goingonlyfromthe sender to the receiver, frames do travel in both directions. Consequently, the communica- tion channel between the two data link layers needs to be capable of bidirectional information transfer. However, this protocol entails a strict alternation of flow: first the sender sends a frame, then the receiver sends a frame, then the sender sends another frame, then the receiver sends another one, and so on. A half- duplexphysicalchannel wouldsuffice here. As in protocol 1, the sender starts out by fetching a packet from the network layer, using it to construct a frame, and sending it on its way. But now, unlike in protocol 1, the sender must wait until an acknowledgement frame arrives before looping back and fetching the next packet from the network layer. The sending data link layer need not even inspect the incoming frame as there is only one pos- sibility. The incomingframe isalways anacknowledgement. The only difference between receiver1 and receiver2 is that after delivering a packet to the network layer, receiver2 sends an acknowledgement frame back to the sender before entering the wait loop again. Because only the arrival of the frame back at the sender is important, not its contents, the receiver need not put anyparticular information init. 3.3.3 A Simplex Stop-and-Wait Protocol for aNoisy Channel Now let us consider the normal situation of a communication channel that makes errors', 'Frames may be either damaged or lost completely.

Asimplexstop-and-waitprotocol. when it computes the checksum. If the frame is damaged in such a way that the checksum is nevertheless correct—an unlikely occurrence—this protocol (and all other protocols) can fail (i.e., deliver anincorrect packet tothenetwork layer). Atfirst glance itmightseem thatavariation ofprotocol 2wouldwork: adding a timer. The sender could send a frame, but the receiver would only send an ac- knowledgementframe if the data were correctly received. If a damaged frame ar- rived at the receiver, it would be discarded. After a while the sender would time out and send the frame again. This process would be repeated until the frame finally arrived intact. This scheme has a fatal flaw in it though. Think about the problem and try to discover what mightgowrongbefore reading further. 224 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 To see what might go wrong, remember that the goal of the data link layer is to provide error-free, transparent communication between network layer proc- esses. The network layer on machine A gives a series of packets to its data link layer, which must ensure that an identical series of packets is delivered to the net- work layer onmachine Bbyits data linklayer. Inparticular, the network layer on Bhas noway ofknowingthatapacket hasbeenlostorduplicated,sothe data link layer must guarantee that no combination of transmission errors, however unlike- ly,can cause aduplicatepacket tobedelivered toanetwork layer. Consider thefollowing scenario: 1. The network layer on A gives packet 1 to its data link layer. The packet is correctly received at B and passed to the network layer on B. Bsendsanacknowledgementframe back toA. 2. The acknowledgement frame gets lost completely. It just never ar- rives at all. Life would be a great deal simpler if the channel man- gled and lost onlydata frames and not control frames, but sad to say, thechannel isnotverydiscriminating. 3. The data link layer on A eventually times out. Not having received an acknowledgement, it (incorrectly) assumes that its data frame was lostordamaged andsendstheframe containing packet 1again. 4. The duplicateframe also arrives intact at the data link layer onB and isunwittinglypassed tothenetwork layer there. IfAissendingafile toB,part of the file will be duplicated (i.e., the copy of the file made by B will be incorrect and the error will not have been detected). In other words,theprotocol willfail. Clearly, what is needed is some way for the receiver to be able to distinguish a frame that it is seeing for the first time from a retransmission', 'The obviousway to achieve this is to have the sender put a sequence number in the header of each frame it sends. Then the receivercan check the sequence number ofeach arriving frame tosee ifitisanewframe oraduplicatetobediscarded. Since the protocol must be correct and the sequence number field in the head- er is likely to be small to use the link efficiently, the question arises: what is the minimum numberofbitsneeded forthesequence number? Theheader mightpro- vide 1 bit, a few bits, 1 byte, or multiple bytes for a sequence number depending on the protocol. The important point is that it must carry sequence numbers that are large enoughfortheprotocol toworkcorrectly, oritisnotmuchofaprotocol. The only ambiguity in this protocol is between a frame, m, and its direct suc- cessor, m +1. Ifframe mislostordamaged, thereceiverwillnotacknowledgeit, so the sender will keep trying to send it. Once it has been correctly received, the receiver will send an acknowledgement to the sender. It is here that the potential SEC. 3.3 ELEMENTARYDATALINKPROTOCOLS 225 troublecrops up. Depending uponwhether the acknowledgement frame gets back tothesender correctly ornot,thesender maytrytosendmorm +1. Atthesender, theevent that triggers the transmission offrame m +1isthe ar- rival of an acknowledgement for frame m. But this situation implies that m −1 has been correctly received, and furthermore that its acknowledgement has also been correctly received by the sender. Otherwise, the sender would not have begunwith m, let alone have been considering m +1. Asa consequence, the only ambiguity is between a frame and its immediate predecessor or successor, not be- tween thepredecessorandsuccessorthemselves. A 1-bit sequence number (0 or 1) is therefore sufficient. At each instant of time, the receiver expects a particular sequence number next. When a frame con- taining the correct sequence number arrives, it is accepted and passed to the net- work layer, then acknowledged. Then the expected sequence number is incre- mented modulo 2 (i.e., 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). Any arriving frame con- taining the wrong sequence number is rejected as a duplicate. However, the last valid acknowledgement is repeated so that the sender can eventually discover that theframe hasbeen received. Anexample ofthiskindof protocol is shown inFig. 3-14. Protocols in which the sender waits for a positive acknowledgement before advancing to the next data item are often called ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) or PAR (Positive Acknowledgement with Retransmission). Like protocol 2, this one also trans- mitsdata onlyinonedirection. Protocol 3differs fromitspredecessorsinthatbothsender andreceiverhave a variable whose value is remembered while the data link layer is in the wait state. The sender remembers the sequence number of the next frame to send in next frame to send; the receiver remembers the sequence number of the next frame expected in frame expected. Each protocol has a short initialization phase before entering theinfinite loop. After transmitting a frame, the sender starts the timer running. If it was al- ready running, it will be reset to allow another full timer interval', 'The interval shouldbe chosen to allow enough time for the frame to get to the receiver, for the receiver to process it in the worst case, and for the acknowledgement frame to propagate back to the sender. Only when that interval has elapsed is it safe to as- sume that either the transmitted frame or its acknowledgement has been lost, and tosendaduplicate. Ifthetimeout interval isset tooshort, the sender willtransmit unnecessary frames. While these extra frames will not affect the correctness of theprotocol, theywillhurtperformance. After transmitting a frame and starting the timer, the sender waits for some- thing exciting to happen. Only three possibilities exist: an acknowledgement frame arrives undamaged, a damaged acknowledgement frame staggers in, or the timer expires. If a valid acknowledgement comes in, the sender fetches the next packet from its network layer and puts it in the buffer, overwriting the previous packet. It also advances the sequence number. If a damaged frame arrives or the 226 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 timer expires, neither the buffer nor the sequence number is changed so that a duplicatecan be sent. Inall cases, the contents ofthe buffer (either thenextpack- etoraduplicate)are thensent. When a valid frame arrives at the receiver, its sequence number is checked to see if it is a duplicate. If not, it is accepted, passed to the network layer, and an acknowledgement is generated. Duplicates and damaged frames are notpassed to the network layer, but they do cause the last correctly received frame to be acknowledged to signal the sender to advance to the next frame or retransmit a damaged frame. 3.4 SLIDING WINDOW PROTOCOLS In the previous protocols, data frames were transmitted in one direction only. In most practical situations, there is a need to transmit data in both directions. One way of achieving full-duplex data transmission is to run two instances of one of the previous protocols, each using a separate link for simplex data traffic (in different directions). Each link is then comprised of a ‘‘forward’’ channel (for data) and a ‘‘reverse’’ channel (for acknowledgements). In both cases the capaci- tyofthereverse channel isalmost entirely wasted. A better idea is to use the same link for data in both directions. After all, in protocols 2 and 3 it was already being used to transmit frames both ways, and the reverse channel normally has the same capacity as the forward channel. In this model the data frames from A to B are intermixed with the acknowledgement frames from A to B. By looking at the kind field in the header of an incoming frame, thereceivercan tellwhether theframe isdata oranacknowledgement. Although interleaving data and control frames on the same link is a big im- provement over having two separate physical links, yet another improvement is possible. When a data frame arrives, instead of immediately sending a separate control frame, the receiver restrains itself and waits until the network layer passes it the next packet. The acknowledgement is attached to the outgoing data frame (using the ack field in the frame header)', 'In effect, the acknowledgement gets a free ride on the next outgoing data frame. The technique of temporarily delaying outgoing acknowledgements so that they can be hooked onto the next outgoing data frame isknownaspiggybacking. The principal advantage of using piggybacking over having distinct acknowl- edgement frames isabetter use ofthe available channel bandwidth. The ack field in the frame header costs only a few bits, whereas a separate frame would need a header, the acknowledgement, and a checksum. In addition, fewer frames sent generally means a lighter processing load at the receiver. In the next protocol to be examined, the piggyback field costs only 1 bit in the frame header. It rarely costsmore thanafew bits. However, piggybacking introduces a complication not present with separate acknowledgements. How long should the data link layer wait for a packet onto SEC. 3.4 SLIDING WINDOWPROTOCOLS 227 /*Protocol3(PAR)allowsunidirectionaldataflowoveranunreliablechannel.*/ #defineMAX SEQ1 /*mustbe1forprotocol3*/ typedefenum{frame arrival,cksum err,timeout}event type; #include\"protocol.h\" voidsender3(void) { seq nrnext frame to send; /*seqnumberofnextoutgoingframe*/ frames; /*scratchvariable*/ packetbuffer; /*bufferforanoutboundpacket*/ event typeevent; next frame to send=0; /*initializeoutboundsequencenumbers*/ from network layer(&buffer); /*fetchfirstpacket*/ while(true){ s.info=buffer; /*constructaframefortransmission*/ s.seq=next frame to send; /*insertsequencenumberinframe*/ to physical layer(&s); /*senditonitsway*/ start timer(s.seq); /*ifanswertakestoolong,timeout*/ wait for event(&event); /*frame arrival,cksum err,timeout*/ if(event==frame arrival){ from physical layer(&s); /*gettheacknowledgement*/ if(s.ack==next frame to send){ stop timer(s.ack); /*turnthetimeroff*/ from network layer(&buffer); /*getthenextonetosend*/ inc(next frame to send); /*invertnext frame to send*/ } } } } voidreceiver3(void) { seq nrframe expected; framer,s; event typeevent; frame expected=0; while(true){ wait for event(&event); /*possibilities:frame arrival,cksum err*/ if(event==frame arrival){ /*avalidframehasarrived*/ from physical layer(&r); /*gogetthenewlyarrivedframe*/ if(r.seq==frame expected){ /*thisiswhatwehavebeenwaitingfor*/ to network layer(&r.info); /*passthedatatothenetworklayer*/ inc(frame expected); /*nexttimeexpecttheothersequencenr*/ } s.ack=1−frame expected; /*tellwhichframeisbeingacked*/ to physical layer(&s); /*sendacknowledgement*/ } } } Figure3-14. Apositiveacknowledgementwithretransmissionprotocol. 228 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 which to piggyback the acknowledgement? If the data link layer waits longer than the sender’s timeout period, the frame will be retransmitted, defeating the whole purpose of having acknowledgements. If the data link layer were an oracle and could foretell the future, it would know when the next network layer packet was going to come in and could decide either to wait for it or send a separate ac- knowledgement immediately, depending on how long the projected wait was going to be. Of course, the data link layer cannot foretell the future, so it must resort to some ad hoc scheme, such as waiting a fixed number of milliseconds. If a new packet arrives quickly, the acknowledgement is piggybacked onto it. Otherwise, if no new packet has arrived by the end of this time period, the data linklayer justsendsaseparate acknowledgementframe. The next three protocols are bidirectional protocols that belong to a class cal- led sliding window protocols. The three differ among themselves in terms of ef- ficiency, complexity, and buffer requirements, as discussed later. In these, as in all sliding window protocols, each outbound frame contains a sequence number, ranging from 0 up to some maximum. The maximum is usually 2n −1 so the se- quence number fits exactly in an n-bit field. The stop-and-wait sliding window protocol uses n =1, restricting the sequence numbers to 0and 1, butmore sophis- ticated versions can useanarbitrary n', 'The essence of all sliding window protocols is that at any instant of time, the sender maintains a set of sequence numbers corresponding to frames it is permit- ted to send. These frames are said to fall within the sending window. Similarly, the receiveralsomaintains areceivingwindow correspondingtothesetofframes it is permitted to accept. The sender’s window and the receiver’s window need not have the same lower and upper limits or even have the same size. In some protocols they are fixed in size, but in others they can grow or shrink over the course oftimeasframes are sentandreceived. Although these protocols give the data link layer more freedom about the order inwhich itmay send andreceiveframes, we have definitely notdroppedthe requirement thattheprotocol mustdeliver packets tothedestination network layer in the same order they were passed to the data link layer on the sending machine. Nor have we changed the requirement that the physical communication channel is ‘‘wire-like,’’thatis,itmustdeliver allframes intheordersent. The sequence numbers within the sender’s windowrepresent frames that have been sent orcan besentbutare asyetnotacknowledged. Whenever anewpacket arrives from the network layer, it is given the next highest sequence number, and the upper edge of the window is advanced by one. When an acknowledgement comes in, the lower edge is advanced by one. In this way the window continu- ouslymaintains alistofunacknowledgedframes. Figure 3-15showsanexample. Since frames currently within the sender’s window may ultimately be lost or damaged in transit, the sender must keep all of these frames in its memory for possible retransmission. Thus,ifthemaximum windowsize isn,the sender needs n buffers to hold the unacknowledged frames.

The receiving data link layer’s window corresponds to the frames it may ac- cept. Anyframe fallingwithinthewindowisputinthereceiver’sbuffer. When a frame whose sequence number is equal to the lower edge of the window is re- ceived, it is passed to the network layer and the window is rotated by one. Any frame falling outside the window is discarded. In all of these cases, a subsequent acknowledgement is generated so that the sender may work out how to proceed. Note that a windowsize of 1means that the data link layer onlyaccepts frames in order, but for larger windows this is not so. The network layer, in contrast, is al- ways feddata intheproperorder, regardless ofthedata linklayer’s windowsize. Figure 3-15 shows an example with a maximum window size of 1', 'Initially, no frames are outstanding, so the lower and upper edges of the sender’s window are equal, butastime goeson,thesituation progresses asshown. Unlike thesend- er’s window, the receiver’s window always remains at its initial size, rotating as thenextframe isacceptedanddelivered tothenetwork layer. 3.4.1 A One-Bit Sliding Window Protocol Before tackling the general case, let us examine a sliding window protocol with a window size of 1. Such a protocol uses stop-and-wait since the sender transmits aframe andwaits foritsacknowledgementbefore sendingthenextone. 230 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 Figure 3-16 depicts such a protocol. Like the others, it starts out by defining some variables. Next frame to send tells which frame the sender is trying to send. Similarly, frame expected tells which frame the receiver is expecting. In bothcases, 0and1are theonlypossibilities. /*Protocol4(Slidingwindow)isbidirectional.*/ #defineMAX SEQ1 /*mustbe1forprotocol4*/ typedefenum{frame arrival,cksum err,timeout}event type; #include\"protocol.h\" voidprotocol4(void) { seq nrnext frame to send; /*0or1only*/ seq nrframe expected; /*0or1only*/ framer,s; /*scratchvariables*/ packetbuffer; /*currentpacketbeingsent*/ event typeevent; next frame to send=0; /*nextframeontheoutboundstream*/ frame expected=0; /*frameexpectednext*/ from network layer(&buffer); /*fetchapacketfromthenetworklayer*/ s.info=buffer; /*preparetosendtheinitialframe*/ s.seq=next frame to send; /*insertsequencenumberintoframe*/ s.ack=1−frame expected; /*piggybackedack*/ to physical layer(&s); /*transmittheframe*/ start timer(s.seq); /*startthetimerrunning*/ while(true){ wait for event(&event); /*frame arrival,cksum err,ortimeout*/ if(event==frame arrival){ /*aframehasarrivedundamaged*/ from physical layer(&r); /*gogetit*/ if(r.seq==frame expected){ /*handleinboundframestream*/ to network layer(&r.info); /*passpackettonetworklayer*/ inc(frame expected); /*invertseqnumberexpectednext*/ } if(r.ack==next frame to send){ /*handleoutboundframestream*/ stop timer(r.ack); /*turnthetimeroff*/ from network layer(&buffer); /*fetchnewpktfromnetworklayer*/ inc(next frame to send); /*invertsender’ssequencenumber*/ } } s.info=buffer; /*constructoutboundframe*/ s.seq=next frame to send; /*insertsequencenumberintoit*/ s.ack=1−frame expected; /*seqnumberoflastreceivedframe*/ to physical layer(&s); /*transmitaframe*/ start timer(s.seq); /*startthetimerrunning*/ } } Figure3-16. A1-bitslidingwindowprotocol. SEC. 3.4 SLIDING WINDOWPROTOCOLS 231 Under normal circumstances, one of the two data link layers goes first and transmits the first frame. In other words, only one of the data link layer programs should contain the to physical layer and start timer procedure calls outside the main loop. The starting machine fetches the first packet from its network layer, builds a frame from it, and sends it. When this (or any) frame arrives, the receiv- ing data link layer checks to see if it is a duplicate, just as in protocol 3. If the frame isthe one expected, it ispassed tothe network layer and the receiver’s win- dowisslidup. The acknowledgement field contains the number of the last frame received without error. If this number agrees with the sequence number of the frame the sender is trying to send, the sender knows it is done with the frame stored in buff- er and can fetch the next packet from its network layer. If the sequence number disagrees, it must continue trying to send the same frame. Whenever a frame is received,aframe isalsosent back. Now let us examine protocol 4 to see how resilient it is to pathological scen- arios. Assume that computer A is trying to send its frame 0 to computer B and that B is trying to send its frame 0 to A. Suppose that A sends a frame to B, but A’stimeout interval isa littletooshort. Consequently, Amaytime outrepeatedly, sendingaseries ofidentical frames, allwithseq =0andack =1', 'When the first valid frame arrives at computer B, it will be accepted and frame expected will be set to a value of 1. All the subsequent frames received will be rejected because B is now expecting frames with sequence number 1, not 0. Furthermore, since all the duplicateswillhave ack =1andBisstillwaitingfor an acknowledgement of 0, B will not go and fetch a new packet from its network layer. After every rejected duplicate comes in, B will send A a frame containing seq =0and ack =0. Eventually, one of these willarrive correctly at A,causing A to begin sending the next packet. No combination of lost frames or premature timeouts can cause the protocol to deliver duplicate packets to either network layer, toskipapacket, ortodeadlock. Theprotocol iscorrect. However, to show how subtle protocol interactions can be, we note that a pe- culiar situation arises if both sides simultaneously send an initial packet. This synchronization difficulty isillustratedbyFig.3-17. Inpart (a), thenormal opera- tion of the protocol is shown. In (b) the peculiarity is illustrated. If B waits for A’s first frame before sending one of its own, the sequence is as shown in (a), and every frame isaccepted. However, if A and B simultaneously initiate communication, their first frames cross, and the data link layers then get into situation (b). In (a) each frame arrival brings a new packet for the network layer; there are no duplicates. In (b) half of the frames contain duplicates,even thoughthere are notransmission errors. Simi- lar situations can occur as a result of premature timeouts, even when one side clearly starts first. In fact, if multiple premature timeouts occur, frames may be sentthree ormoretimes, wasting valuable bandwidth. 232 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 Asends(0,1,A0) Asends(0,1,A0) Bsends(0,1,B0) Bgets(0,1,A0)* Bgets(0,1,A0)* Bsends(0,0,B0) Bsends(0,0,B0) Agets(0,0,B0)* Agets(0,1,B0)* Asends(1,0,A1) Asends(0,0,A0) Bgets(1,0,A1)* Bsends(1,1,B1) Bgets(0,0,A0) Agets(1,1,B1)* Bsends(1,0,B1) Asends(0,1,A2) Agets(0,0,B0) Bgets(0,1,A2)* Asends(1,0,A1) Bsends(0,0,B2) Bgets(1,0,A1)* Agets(0,0,B2)* Bsends(1,1,B1) Asends(1,0,A3) Bgets(1,0,A3)* Agets(1,0,B1)* Asends(1,1,A1) Bsends(1,1,B3) Bgets(1,1,A1) Bsends(0,1,B2) Time (a) (b) Figure3-17.

Anasterisk indicates where a networklayeracceptsapacket. 3.4.2 A Protocol Using Go-Back-N Until now we have made the tacit assumption that the transmission time re- quired for a frame to arrive at the receiver plus the transmission time for the ac- knowledgement to come back is negligible. Sometimes this assumption is clearly false. In these situations the long round-triptime can have important implications fortheefficiency ofthe bandwidth utilization. Asan example, consider a50-kbps satellite channel with a 500-msec round-trip propagation delay. Let us imagine trying to use protocol 4 to send 1000-bit frames via the satellite. At t =0 the sender starts sending the first frame. At t =20 msec the frame has been com- pletely sent. Not until t =270 msec has the frame fully arrived at the receiver, and not until t =520 msec has the acknowledgement arrived back at the sender, under the best of circumstances (of no waiting in the receiver and a short ac- knowledgement frame). This means that the sender was blocked 500/520 or 96% of the time', 'In other words, only 4% of the available bandwidth was used. Clear- ly, the combination of a long transit time, high bandwidth, and short frame length isdisastrous interms ofefficiency. The problem described here can be viewed as a consequence of the rule re- quiring asender towait foranacknowledgementbefore sendinganother frame. If we relax that restriction, much better efficiency can be achieved. Basically, the solution lies inallowing the sender totransmit uptowframes before blocking, in- stead of just 1. With a large enough choice of w the sender will be able to con- tinuously transmit frames since the acknowledgements will arrive for previous frames before thewindowbecomes full,preventing thesender fromblocking. SEC. 3.4 SLIDING WINDOWPROTOCOLS 233 To find an appropriate value for w we need to know how many frames can fit inside the channel as they propagate from sender to receiver. This capacity is de- termined by the bandwidth in bits/sec multiplied by the one-way transit time, or the bandwidth-delay product of the link. We can divide this quantity by the number of bits in a frame to express it as a number of frames. Call this quantity BD. Then w should be set to 2BD +1. Twice the bandwidth-delay is the number of frames that can be outstanding if the sender continuously sends frames when the round-trip time to receive an acknowledgement is considered. The ‘‘+1’’ is because an acknowledgement frame will not be sent until after a complete frame isreceived. For the example link with a bandwidth of 50 kbps and a one-way transit time of 250 msec, the bandwidth-delay product is 12.5 kbit or 12.5 frames of 1000 bits each. 2BD +1 is then 26 frames. Assume the sender begins sending frame 0 as before and sends a new frame every 20 msec. By the time it has finished sending 26 frames, at t =520 msec, the acknowledgement for frame 0 will have just arri- ved. Thereafter, acknowledgements will arrive every 20 msec, so the sender will always getpermission tocontinue just when it needs it. From then onwards, 25or 26 unacknowledged frames will always be outstanding. Put in other terms, the sender’s maximum windowsize is26. For smaller window sizes, the utilization of the link will be less than 100% since the sender will be blocked sometimes. We can write the utilization as the fraction oftime thatthesender isnotblocked: w linkutilization≤ 1+2BD This value is an upper bound because it does not allow for any frame processing time and treats the acknowledgement frame as having zero length, since it is usually short. The equation shows the need for having a large window w when- ever the bandwidth-delay product is large. If the delay is high, the sender will ra- pidly exhaust its window even for a moderate bandwidth, as in the satellite ex- ample. If the bandwidth is high, even for a moderate delay the sender will exhaust its window quickly unless it has a large window (e.g., a 1-Gbps link with 1-msec delay holds 1 megabit). With stop-and-wait for which w =1, if there is even oneframe’s worthofpropagation delay theefficiency willbelessthan50%', 'This technique of keeping multiple frames in flight is an example of pipelin- ing. Pipelining frames over an unreliable communication channel raises some serious issues. First, what happens if a frame in the middle of a long stream is damaged or lost? Large numbers of succeeding frames will arrive at the receiver before the sender even finds out that anything is wrong. When a damaged frame arrives at the receiver, it obviously should be discarded, but what should the re- ceiver do with all the correct frames following it? Remember that the receiving data linklayer isobligated tohandpackets tothenetwork layer insequence. 234 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 Two basic approaches are available for dealing with errors in the presence of pipelining, bothofwhich are showninFig.3-18.

Pipelininganderrorrecovery.Effectofanerrorwhen (a)receiver’swindowsizeis1and(b)receiver’swindowsizeislarge. One option, called go-back-n, is for the receiver simply to discard all subsequent frames, sending no acknowledgements for the discarded frames. This strategy corresponds to a receive window of size 1. In other words, the data link layer refuses to accept any frame except the next one it must give to the network layer. Ifthe sender’s windowfillsupbefore the timer runsout, the pipeline will begin to empty. Eventually, the sender will time out and retransmit all unacknowledged frames inorder, starting with the damaged or lost one. This approach can waste a lotofbandwidth iftheerrorrate ishigh. In Fig.3-18(b) we see go-back-n for the case in which the receiver’s window is large. Frames 0 and 1 are correctly received and acknowledged. Frame 2, however, is damaged or lost. The sender, unaware of this problem, continues to send frames until the timer for frame 2 expires. Then it backs up to frame 2 and starts overwithit,sending2,3,4,etc. alloveragain. The other general strategy for handling errors when frames are pipelined is called selective repeat. When it isused, abadframe thatisreceivedisdiscarded, but any goodframes received after it are accepted and buffered. When the sender times out, only the oldest unacknowledged frame is retransmitted. If that frame SEC. 3.4 SLIDING WINDOWPROTOCOLS 235 arrives correctly, the receivercan deliver tothe network layer, insequence, all the frames it has buffered. Selective repeat corresponds to a receiver window larger than 1', 'This approach can require large amounts of data link layer memory if the windowislarge. Selective repeat is often combined with having the receiver send a negative acknowledgement(NAK)whenitdetects anerror, forexample, whenitreceivesa checksum error or a frame out of sequence. NAKs stimulate retransmission be- forethecorrespondingtimer expires andthusimprove performance. InFig.3-18(b), frames 0and1are again correctly receivedand acknowledged and frame 2is lost. When frame 3arrives at the receiver, the data link layer there notices that it has missed a frame, so it sends back a NAK for 2 but buffers 3. When frames 4 and 5 arrive, they, too, are buffered by the data link layer instead of being passed to the network layer. Eventually, the NAK 2 gets back to the sender, which immediately resends frame 2. When thatarrives, thedata linklayer now has 2, 3, 4, and 5 and can pass all of them to the network layer in the correct order. It can also acknowledge all frames up to and including 5, as shown in the figure. Ifthe NAKshouldget lost, eventually the sender willtime out for frame 2 andsendit(andonlyit)ofitsownaccord,butthatmaybeaquiteawhile later. These twoalternative approaches are trade-offs between efficient use ofband- width and data link layer buffer space. Depending on which resource is scarcer, one or the other can be used. Figure 3-19 shows a go-back-n protocol in which the receiving data link layer only accepts frames in order; frames following an error are discarded. In this protocol, for the first time we have dropped the as- sumption that the network layer always has an infinite supply of packets to send. When the network layer has a packet it wants to send, it can cause a net- work layer ready event to happen. However, to enforce the flow control limit on the sender window or the number of unacknowledged frames that may be out- standing at any time, the data link layer must be able to keep the network layer from bothering it with more work. The library procedures enable network layer anddisable network layer dothisjob. The maximum number of frames that may be outstanding at any instant is not the same as the size of the sequence number space. For go-back-n, MAX SEQ frames may be outstanding at any instant, even though there are MAX SEQ +1 distinct sequence numbers (which are 0, 1, ..., MAX SEQ). We will see an even tighter restriction forthenextprotocol, selective repeat. Tosee whythisres- triction isrequired, consider thefollowing scenario withMAX SEQ =7: 1. The sender sendsframes 0through7. 2. Apiggybackedacknowledgementfor7comes back tothesender. 3. The sender sends another eight frames, again with sequence numbers 0through7. 4. Nowanother piggybackedacknowledgementforframe 7comes in. 236 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP', '3 /*Protocol5(Go-back-n)allowsmultipleoutstandingframes.Thesendermaytransmitup toMAX SEQframeswithoutwaitingforanack.Inaddition,unlikeintheprevious protocols,thenetworklayerisnotassumedtohaveanewpacketallthetime.Instead, thenetworklayercausesanetwork layer readyeventwhenthereisapackettosend.*/ #defineMAX SEQ7 typedefenum{frame arrival,cksum err,timeout,network layer ready}event type; #include\"protocol.h\" staticbooleanbetween(seq nra,seq nrb,seq nrc) { /*Returntrueifa<=b<ccircularly;falseotherwise.*/ if(((a<=b)&&(b<c))||((c<a)&&(a<=b))||((b<c)&&(c<a))) return(true); else return(false); } staticvoidsend data(seq nrframe nr,seq nrframe expected,packetbuffer[]) { /*Constructandsendadataframe.*/ frames; /*scratchvariable*/ s.info=buffer[frame nr]; /*insertpacketintoframe*/ s.seq=frame nr; /*insertsequencenumberintoframe*/ s.ack=(frame expected+MAX SEQ)%(MAX SEQ+1);/*piggybackack*/ to physical layer(&s); /*transmittheframe*/ start timer(frame nr); /*startthetimerrunning*/ } voidprotocol5(void) { seq nrnext frame to send; /*MAX SEQ>1;usedforoutboundstream*/ seq nrack expected; /*oldestframeasyetunacknowledged*/ seq nrframe expected; /*nextframeexpectedoninboundstream*/ framer; /*scratchvariable*/ packetbuffer[MAX SEQ+1]; /*buffersfortheoutboundstream*/ seq nrnbuffered; /*numberofoutputbufferscurrentlyinuse*/ seq nri; /*usedtoindexintothebufferarray*/ event typeevent; enable network layer(); /*allownetwork layer readyevents*/ ack expected=0; /*nextackexpectedinbound*/ next frame to send=0; /*nextframegoingout*/ frame expected=0; /*numberofframeexpectedinbound*/ nbuffered=0; /*initiallynopacketsarebuffered*/ while(true){ wait for event(&event); /*fourpossibilities:seeevent typeabove*/ SEC. 3.4 SLIDING WINDOWPROTOCOLS 237 switch(event){ casenetwork layer ready: /*thenetworklayerhasapackettosend*/ /*Accept,save,andtransmitanewframe.*/ from network layer(&buffer[next frame to send]);/*fetchnewpacket*/ nbuffered=nbuffered+1; /*expandthesender’swindow*/ send data(next frame to send,frame expected,buffer);/*transmittheframe*/ inc(next frame to send); /*advancesender’supperwindowedge*/ break; caseframe arrival: /*adataorcontrolframehasarrived*/ from physical layer(&r); /*getincomingframefromphysicallayer*/ if(r.seq==frame expected){ /*Framesareacceptedonlyinorder.*/ to network layer(&r.info); /*passpackettonetworklayer*/ inc(frame expected); /*advanceloweredgeofreceiver’swindow*/ } /*Acknimpliesn−1,n−2,etc. Checkforthis.*/ while(between(ack expected,r.ack,next frame to send)){ /*Handlepiggybackedack.*/ nbuffered=nbuffered−1; /*oneframefewerbuffered*/ stop timer(ack expected); /*framearrivedintact;stoptimer*/ inc(ack expected); /*contractsender’swindow*/ } break; casecksum err:break; /*justignorebadframes*/ casetimeout: /*trouble;retransmitalloutstandingframes*/ next frame to send=ack expected; /*startretransmittinghere*/ for(i=1;i<=nbuffered;i++){ send data(next frame to send,frame expected,buffer);/*resendframe*/ inc(next frame to send); /*preparetosendthenextone*/ } } if(nbuffered<MAX SEQ) enable network layer(); else disable network layer(); } } Figure3-19. Aslidingwindowprotocolusinggo-back-n. The question is this: didall eight frames belonging tothe second batch arrive suc- cessfully, or did all eight get lost (counting discards following an error as lost)? In both cases the receiver would be sending frame 7 as the acknowledgement. 238 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 The sender has no way of telling. For this reason the maximum number of out- standing frames mustberestricted toMAX SEQ. Although protocol 5 does not buffer the frames arriving after an error, it does not escape the problem of buffering altogether. Since a sender may have to retransmit all the unacknowledged frames at a future time, it must hang on to all transmitted frames until it knows for sure that they have been accepted by the re- ceiver. When an acknowledgement comes in for frame n, frames n −1, n −2, and so onare also automatically acknowledged. This type ofacknowledgementis called a cumulative acknowledgement. This property is especially important when some of the previous acknowledgement-bearing frames were lost or gar- bled. Whenever any acknowledgementcomes in,the data link layer checks tosee if any buffers can now be released. If buffers can be released (i.e., there is some roomavailable inthewindow),apreviously blocked network layer can nowbeal- lowedtocause more network layer ready events. For this protocol, we assume that there is always reverse traffic on which to piggyback acknowledgements. Protocol 4 does not need this assumption since it sends back one frame every time it receives a frame, even if it has already sent that frame. Inthenextprotocol wewillsolve theproblem ofone-way traffic inan elegant way. Because protocol 5 has multiple outstanding frames, it logically needs multi- ple timers, one per outstanding frame. Each frame times out independently of all the other ones', 'However, all of these timers can easily be simulated in software using a single hardware clock that causes interrupts periodically. The pending timeouts form a linked list, with each node of the list containing the number of clock ticks untilthe timer expires, the frame being timed, anda pointer tothe next node.

(a) The queued time- outs.(b)Thesituationafterthefirsttimeouthasexpired. As an illustration of how the timers could be implemented, consider the ex- ample of Fig.3-20(a). Assume that the clock ticks once every 1 msec. Initially, SEC. 3.4 SLIDING WINDOWPROTOCOLS 239 the real time is 10:00:00.000; three timeouts are pending, at 10:00:00.005, 10:00:00.013, and 10:00:00.019. Every time the hardware clock ticks, the real time is updated and the tick counter at the head of the list is decremented. When the tick counter becomes zero, a timeout is caused and the node is removed from the list, as shown in Fig.3-20(b). Although this organization requires the list to be scanned when start timer or stop timer is called, it does not require much work per tick. In protocol 5, both of these routines have been given a parameter indicating which frame istobetimed. 3.4.3 A Protocol Using Selective Repeat The go-back-n protocol works well if errors are rare, but if the line is poor it wastes a lot of bandwidth on retransmitted frames. An alternative strategy, the selective repeat protocol, is to allow the receiver to accept and buffer the frames following adamaged orlostone. In this protocol, both sender and receiver maintain a window of outstanding and acceptable sequence numbers, respectively. The sender’s window size starts outat 0and growsto some predefined maximum. The receiver’s window, in con- trast, is always fixed in size and equal to the predetermined maximum. The re- ceiver has a buffer reserved for each sequence number within its fixed window. Associated with each buffer is a bit (arrived) telling whether the buffer is full or empty. Whenever aframe arrives, itssequence number ischecked bythefunction between tosee ifitfalls within the window. Ifsoandifithasnotalready been re- ceived, itisacceptedandstored. Thisaction istaken withoutregard towhether or not the frame contains the next packet expected by the network layer. Of course, it must be kept within the data link layer and not passed to the network layer until all the lower-numbered frames have already been delivered to the network layer inthecorrect order. Aprotocol usingthisalgorithm isgiveninFig.3-21. Nonsequential receive introduces further constraints on frame sequence num- bers compared to protocols in which frames are only accepted in order. We can illustrate the trouble most easily with an example. Suppose that we have a 3-bit sequence number, so that the sender is permitted to transmit up to seven frames before being required to wait for an acknowledgement. Initially, the sender’s and receiver’s windows are as shown in Fig. 3-22(a). The sender now transmits frames 0 through 6. The receiver’s window allows it to accept any frame with a sequence number between 0and6inclusive', 'All seven frames arrive correctly, so the receiver acknowledges them and advances its window to allow receipt of 7, 0, 1,2,3,4,or5,asshowninFig.3-22(b). Allseven buffers are marked empty. It is at this point that disaster strikes in the form of a lightning bolt hitting the telephone pole and wiping out all the acknowledgements. The protocol should operate correctly despite this disaster. The sender eventually times out and re- transmits frame 0. When this frame arrives at the receiver, a check ismade tosee if it falls within the receiver’s window.

Aslidingwindowprotocolusingselectiverepeat. 242 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 within the new window, so it is accepted as a new frame. The receiver also sends a (piggybacked) acknowledgement for frame 6, since 0 through 6 have been re- ceived. The sender is happy to learn that all its transmitted frames did actually arrive correctly, so it advances its window and immediately sends frames 7, 0, 1, 2, 3,4, and 5. Frame 7 will be accepted by the receiver and its packet will be passed di- rectly to the network layer', 'Immediately thereafter, the receiving data link layer checks to see if it has a valid frame 0 already, discovers that it does, and passes the old buffered packet to the network layer as if it were a new packet. Conse- quently, thenetwork layer gets anincorrect packet, andtheprotocol fails. The essence of the problem is that after the receiver advanced its window, the new range of valid sequence numbers overlapped the old one. Consequently, the following batch of frames might be either duplicates (if all the acknowledgements were lost) or new ones (if all the acknowledgements were received). The poorre- ceiver hasnowayofdistinguishingthese twocases. The way outofthis dilemma lies inmaking sure that after the receiverhas ad- vanced its window there is no overlap with the original window. To ensure that there isnooverlap, the maximum window size should be at most half the range of the sequence numbers. This situation is shown in Fig. 3-22(c) and Fig. 3-22(d). With 3 bits, the sequence numbers range from 0 to 7. Only four unacknowledged frames should be outstanding at any instant. That way, if the receiver has just ac- cepted frames 0 through 3 and advanced its window to permit acceptance of frames 4through7,it can unambiguouslytell ifsubsequent frames are retransmis- sions (0 through 3) or new ones (4 through 7). In general, the window size for protocol 6willbe(MAX SEQ +1)/2. An interesting question is: how many buffers must the receiver have? Under no conditions will it ever accept frames whose sequence numbers are below the lower edgeofthewindoworframes whosesequence numbers are abovethe upper edge of the window. Consequently, the number of buffers needed is equal to the window size, not to the range of sequence numbers. In the preceding example of a 3-bit sequence number, four buffers, numbered 0 through 3, are needed. When frame i arrives, it is put in buffer i mod4. Notice that although i and (i +4) mod 4 are ‘‘competing’’ for the same buffer, they are never within the window at the same time, becausethat wouldimplyawindowsize ofatleast 5. For the same reason, the number of timers needed is equal to the number of buffers, not to the size of the sequence space. Effectively, a timer is associated with each buffer. When the timer runs out, the contents of the buffer are retrans- mitted. Protocol 6 also relaxes the implicit assumption that the channel is heavily loaded. We made this assumption in protocol 5 when we relied on frames being sent in the reverse direction on which to piggyback acknowledgements. If the re- verse traffic is light, the acknowledgements may be held up for a long period of time, which can cause problems. In the extreme, if there is a lot of traffic in one SEC', '3.4 SLIDING WINDOWPROTOCOLS 243 Sender 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Receiver 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure3-22.

(d) After 4 frames have been sent and received but not acknowledged. direction and no traffic in the other direction, the protocol will block when the sender windowreachesitsmaximum. To relax this assumption, an auxiliary timer is started bystart ack timer after an in-sequence data frame arrives. If no reverse traffic has presented itself before this timer expires, a separate acknowledgement frame is sent. An interrupt due to the auxiliary timer is called an ack timeout event. With this arrangement, traffic flow inonly one direction is possible because the lack of reverse data frames onto which acknowledgements can be piggybacked is no longer an obstacle. Only one auxiliarytimer exists, andifstart ack timer iscalled while thetimer isrunning,it has no effect. The timer is not reset or extended since its purpose is to provide someminimum rate ofacknowledgements. It is essential that the timeout associated with the auxiliary timer be appreci- ably shorter than the timeout used for timing out data frames. This condition is required to ensure that a correctly received frame is acknowledged early enough thattheframe’s retransmission timer doesnotexpire andretransmit theframe. Protocol 6 uses a more efficient strategy than protocol 5 for dealing with er- rors. Whenever the receiver has reason to suspect that an error has occurred, it sends a negative acknowledgement (NAK) frame back to the sender. Such a frame is a request for retransmission of the frame specified in the NAK. In two cases, thereceivershouldbesuspicious: whenadamaged frame arrives oraframe other than the expected one arrives (potential lostframe). To avoid makingmulti- ple requests for retransmission of the same lost frame, the receiver should keep track of whether a NAK has already been sent for a given frame. The variable no nak in protocol 6 is true if no NAK has been sent yet for frame expected. If the NAK gets mangled or lost, no real harm is done, since the sender will eventu- ally time out and retransmit the missing frame anyway. If the wrong frame ar- rives after a NAK has been sent and lost, no nak will be true and the auxiliary timer will be started. When it expires, an ACK will be sent to resynchronize the sender tothereceiver’scurrent status. 244 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 In some situations, the time required for a frame to propagate to the destina- tion, be processed there, and have the acknowledgement come back is (nearly) constant', 'In these situations, the sender can adjust its timer to be ‘‘tight,’’ just slightly larger than the normal time interval expected between sending a frame andreceivingitsacknowledgement. NAKsare notusefulinthiscase. However, in other situations the time can be highly variable. For example, if the reverse traffic is sporadic, the time before acknowledgement will be shorter when there is reverse traffic and longer when there is not. The sender is faced with the choice of either setting the interval toasmall value (and riskingunneces- sary retransmissions), or setting it to a large value (and going idle for a long period after an error). Both choices waste bandwidth. In general, if the standard deviation of the acknowledgementinterval is large compared to the interval itself, the timer is set ‘‘loose’’ to be conservative. NAKs can then appreciably speed up retransmission oflostordamaged frames. Closely related to the matter of timeouts and NAKs is the question of deter- mining which frame caused a timeout. In protocol 5, it is always ack expected, because it is always the oldest. In protocol 6, there is no trivial way to determine who timed out. Suppose that frames 0 through 4 have been transmitted, meaning that the list of outstanding frames is 01234, in order from oldest to youngest. Now imagine that 0times out, 5(a new frame) is transmitted, 1times out, 2times out, and 6(another new frame) is transmitted. At this point the list of outstanding frames is 3405126, from oldest to youngest. If all inbound traffic (i.e., acknowl- edgement-bearing frames) is lost for a while, the seven outstanding frames will time outinthatorder. To keep the example from getting even more complicated than it already is, we have not shown the timer administration. Instead, we just assume that the variable oldest frame issetupontimeout toindicate whichframe timed out. 3.5 EXAMPLE DATA LINK PROTOCOLS Within a single building, LANs are widely used for interconnection, but most wide-area network infrastructure is built up from point-to-point lines. In Chap. 4, we will look at LANs. Here we will examine the data link protocols found on point-to-point lines in the Internet in two common situations. The first situation is when packets are sent over SONET optical fiber links in wide-area networks. These links are widely used, for example, to connect routers in the different loca- tionsofanISP’s network. The second situation is for ADSL links running on the local loop of the tele- phone network at the edge ofthe Internet. These linksconnectmillionsofindivid- ualsandbusinesses totheInternet. The Internet needs point-to-point links for these uses, as well as dial-up mo- dems, leased lines, andcable modems, and soon. Astandard protocol called PPP SEC. 3.5 EXAMPLE DATALINKPROTOCOLS 245 (Point-to-Point Protocol) is used to send packets over these links. PPP is de- fined in RFC 1661and further elaborated inRFC 1662and other RFCs (Simpson, 1994a,1994b). SONET andADSL linksbothapplyPPP,butindifferent ways. 3.5.1 Packet over SONET SONET, which we covered in Sec. 2.6.4, is the physical layer protocol that is most commonly used over the wide-area optical fiber linksthat make upthe back- bone of communications networks, including the telephone system. It provides a bitstream that runsat awell-defined rate, forexample 2.4GbpsforanOC-48link', 'This bitstream is organized as fixed-size byte payloads that recur every 125 μsec, whether ornotthere isuserdata tosend. To carry packets across these links, some framing mechanism is needed to distinguish occasional packets from the continuous bitstream in which they are transported. PPP runs on IP routers to provide this mechanism, as shown in Fig.3-23. IPpacket Router IP IP PPPframe PPP PPP Optical SONET SONET SONETpayload SONETpayload fiber (a) (b) Figure3-23. PacketoverSONET.(a)Aprotocolstack.(b)Framerelationships. PPP improves onan earlier, simpler protocol called SLIP (Serial Line Inter- net Protocol) and is used to handle error detection link configuration, support multiple protocols, permit authentication, and more. With a wide set of options, PPPprovides three mainfeatures: 1. A framing method that unambiguously delineates the end of one frame and the start of the next one. The frame format also handles errordetection. 2. A link control protocol for bringing lines up, testing them, negotiat- ing options, and bringing them down again gracefully when they are no longer needed. This protocol is called LCP (Link Control Pro- tocol). 3. A way to negotiate network-layer options in a way that is indepen- dent of the network layer protocol to be used. The method chosen is to have a different NCP (Network Control Protocol) for each net- worklayer supported. 246 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 The PPP frame format was chosen to closely resemble the frame format of HDLC (High-level Data Link Control), a widely used instance of an earlier family ofprotocols, since there was noneed toreinvent thewheel. The primary difference between PPP and HDLC is that PPP is byte oriented rather than bitoriented. Inparticular, PPPuses byte stuffing and all frames are an integral number of bytes. HDLC uses bit stuffing and allows frames of, say, 30.25 bytes. There is a second major difference in practice, however. HDLC provides re- liable transmission witha sliding window,acknowledgements,and timeouts inthe manner we have studied. PPP can also provide reliable transmission in noisy en- vironments, such as wireless networks; the exact details are defined in RFC 1663. However, this israrely doneinpractice. Instead, an‘‘unnumberedmode’’isnear- lyalways usedintheInternet toprovideconnectionlessunacknowledgedservice. The PPP frame format is shown in Fig.3-24. All PPP frames begin with the standard HDLC flag byte of 0x7E (01111110).The flag byte is stuffed if it occurs within the Payload field using the escape byte 0x7D. The following byte is the escaped byte XORed with 0x20, which flips the 5th bit. For example, 0x7D 0x5E is the escape sequence for the flag byte 0x7E. This means the start and end of frames can be searched for simply by scanning for the byte 0x7E since it will not occur elsewhere. The destuffing rule when receiving a frame is to look for 0x7D, remove it, and XOR the following byte with 0x20. Also, only one flag byte is needed between frames. Multipleflag bytes can be used to fill the link when there are noframes tobesent. After the start-of-frame flag byte comes the Address field. This field is al- ways set tothe binary value 11111111toindicate that all stations are toacceptthe frame. Usingthisvalue avoidstheissueofhavingtoassigndata linkaddresses', 'Bytes 1 1 1 1or2 Variable 2or4 1 Flag Address Control Flag Protocol Payload Checksum 01111110 11111111 00000011 01111110 Figure3-24.

The fourthPPPfield istheProtocol field. Itsjobistotell what kindofpacket is in the Payload field. Codes starting with a 0bit are defined for IP version 4, IP version 6, and other network layer protocols that might be used, such as IPX and SEC. 3.5 EXAMPLE DATALINKPROTOCOLS 247 AppleTalk. Codes starting with a 1 bit are used for PPP configuration protocols, including LCP and a different NCP for each network layer protocol supported. The default size ofthe Protocol field is2bytes, butit can be negotiated downto1 byte using LCP. The designers were perhaps overly cautious in thinking that someday there mightbemore than256protocols inuse. The Payload field is variable length, up to some negotiated maximum. If the length is not negotiated using LCP during line setup, a default length of 1500 bytesisused. Paddingmayfollowthepayload ifitisneeded. After the Payload field comes the Checksum field, which is normally 2 bytes, but a 4-byte checksum can be negotiated. The 4-byte checksum isinfact the same 32-bit CRC whose generator polynomial is given at the end of Sec. 3.2.2. The 2- bytechecksum isalsoanindustry-standardCRC. PPP is a framing mechanism that can carry the packets of multiple protocols over many types ofphysicallayers. Touse PPPover SONET, thechoices tomake are spelled out in RFC 2615 (Malis and Simpson, 1999). A 4-byte checksum is used, since this is the primary means of detecting transmission errors over the physical, link, and network layers. It is recommended that the Address, Control, and Protocol fields notbecompressed, since SONET linksalready runat relative- lyhighrates. There isalsooneunusualfeature. ThePPPpayload isscrambled (as described inSec. 2.5.1) before itisinserted intotheSONET payload. Scrambling XORsthe payload with a long pseudorandom sequence before it is transmitted. The issue is that the SONET bitstream needs frequent bit transitions for synchronization. These transitions come naturally with the variation in voice signals, but in data communication the user chooses the information that is sent and might send a packet with a longrun of 0s. With scrambling, the likelihood of a user being able tocause problems bysendingalongrunof0sismade extremely low. Before PPPframes canbecarried overSONET lines, thePPPlinkmustbees- tablished andconfigured. Thephases thatthelinkgoesthroughwhenitisbrought up,used,andtaken downagain are showninFig. 3-25. The link starts in the DEAD state, which means that there is no connection at the physical layer. When a physical layer connection is established, the link moves to ESTABLISH. At this point, the PPP peers exchange a series of LCP packets, each carried in the Payload field of a PPP frame, to select the PPP op- tions for the link from the possibilities mentioned above. The initiating peer pro- poses options, and the responding peer either accepts or rejects them, in whole or part. The respondercan alsomake alternative proposals. IfLCP optionnegotiation issuccessful,the link reaches the AUTHENTICATE state', 'Now the two parties can check each other’s identities, if desired. If authentication is successful, the NETWORK state is entered and a series of NCP packets are sent to configure the network layer. It is difficult to generalize about the NCP protocols because each one is specific to some network layer protocol and allows configuration requests to be made that are specific to that protocol. 248 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 Carrier Bothsides Authentication detected agreeonoptions successful ESTABLISH AUTHENTICATE Failed DEAD NETWORK Failed TERMINATE OPEN Carrier Done NCP dropped configuration Figure3-25. StatediagramforbringingaPPPlinkupanddown. For IP, for example, the assignment of IP addresses to both ends of the link is the mostimportant possibility. Once OPEN isreached,data transport can take place. It is in this state that IP packets are carried in PPP frames across the SONET line. When data transport is finished, the link moves into the TERMINATE state, and from there it moves back totheDEAD state whenthephysicallayer connectionisdropped. 3.5.2 ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop) ADSL connects millions of home subscribers to the Internet at megabit/sec rates over the same telephone local loop that is used for plain old telephone ser- vice. In Sec. 2.5.3, we described how a device called a DSL modem is added on the home side. It sends bits over the local loop toa device called a DSLAM (DSL Access Multiplexer), pronounced ‘‘dee-slam,’’ in the telephone company’s local office. Now we will explore in more detail how packets are carried over ADSL links. The overall picture for the protocols and devices used with ADSL is shown in Fig.3-26. Different protocols are deployed indifferent networks, sowehave cho- sen toshow the most popular scenario. Inside the home, a computer such as a PC sends IP packets to the DSL modem using a link layer like Ethernet. The DSL modem then sends the IP packets over the local loop to the DSLAM using the protocols that we are about to study. At the DSLAM (or a router connected to it depending on the implementation) the IP packets are extracted and enter an ISP network sothattheymayreachanydestination ontheInternet. The protocols shown over the ADSL link in Fig. 3-26 start at the bottom with the ADSL physical layer. They are based on a digital modulation scheme called SEC. 3.5 EXAMPLE DATALINKPROTOCOLS 249 IP DSL IP DSLAM PPP modem PPP (withrouter) PC AAL5 AAL5 Ethernet Link ATM ATM Local Internet Ethernet ADSL ADSL loop Customer’shome ISP’soffice Figure3-26. ADSLprotocolstacks. orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (also known as discrete multitone), as we saw in Sec 2.5.3. Near the top of the stack, just below the IP network layer, is PPP. This protocol is the same PPP that we have just studied for packet over SONET transports. It works in the same way to establish and configure the link andcarry IPpackets. Inbetween ADSL andPPPare ATM andAAL5. These are new protocols that we have not seen before. ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) was designed in the early 1990s and launched with incredible hype', 'It promised a network tech- nology that would solve the world’s telecommunications problems by merging voice, data, cable television, telegraph, carrier pigeon, tin cans connected by strings, tom toms, and everything else into an integrated system that could do everything foreveryone. Thisdidnothappen. Inlarge part, the problems ofATM were similar to those we described concerning the OSI protocols, that is, bad tim- ing, technology, implementation, and politics. Nevertheless, ATM was much more successful than OSI. While it has not taken over the world, it remains wide- ly used in niches including broadband access lines such as DSL, and WAN links inside telephonenetworks. ATM is a link layer that is based on the transmission of fixed-length cells of information. The ‘‘Asynchronous’’ in its name means that the cells donot always need to be sent in the way that bits are continuously sent over synchronous lines, as in SONET. Cells only need to be sent when there is information to carry. ATM is a connection-oriented technology. Each cell carries a virtual circuit identifier in its header and devices use this identifier to forward cells along the pathsofestablished connections. The cells are each 53bytes long,consisting ofa48-byte payload plusa 5-byte header. By using small cells, ATM can flexibly divide the bandwidth of a physi- cal layer link among different users in fine slices. This ability is useful when, for example, sending both voice and data over one link without having long data packets that would cause large variations in the delay of the voice samples. The unusual choice for the cell length (e.g., compared to the more natural choice of a 250 THEDATALINKLAYER CHAP. 3 power of 2) is an indication of just how political the design of ATM was. The 48-byte size for the payload was a compromise to resolve a deadlock between Europe, which wanted 32-byte cells, and the U.S., which wanted 64-byte cells. A brief overview ofATMisgivenbySiuandJain(1995). To send data over an ATM network, it needs to be mapped into a sequence of cells. This mapping is done withan ATM adaptation layer inaprocess called seg- mentation and reassembly. Several adaptation layers have been defined for dif- ferent services, ranging from periodic voice samples topacket data. The main one usedforpacket data isAAL5(ATM Adaptation Layer 5). AnAAL5frame isshowninFig. 3-27. Instead ofaheader, ithasatrailer that gives the length and has a 4-byte CRC for error detection. Naturally, the CRC is the same one used for PPP and IEEE 802 LANs like Ethernet. Wang and Crowcroft (1992) have shown that it is strong enough to detect nontraditional er- rors such as cell reordering. As well as a payload, the AAL5 frame has padding. This rounds out the overall length to be a multiple of 48 bytes so that the frame can be evenly divided into cells. Noaddresses are needed onthe frame as the vir- tualcircuit identifier carried ineachcell willgetittotherightdestination.

Now that we have described ATM, we have only to describe how PPP makes use of ATM in the case of ADSL', 'It is done with yet another standard called PPPoA (PPP over ATM). This standard is not really a protocol (so it does not appear in Fig. 3-26) but more a specification of how to work with both PPP and AAL5 frames. Itisdescribed inRFC 2364(Grossetal., 1998). Only the PPP protocol and payload fields are placed in the AAL5 payload, as shown in Fig. 3-27. The protocol field indicates to the DSLAM at the far end whether the payload is an IP packet or a packet from another protocol such as LCP. The far end knows that the cells contain PPP information because an ATM virtual circuit issetupforthispurpose. Within the AAL5 frame, PPP framing is not needed as it would serve no pur- pose; ATM and AAL5 already provide the framing. More framing would be worthless. The PPP CRC is also not needed because AAL5 already includes the very same CRC. This error detection mechanism supplements the ADSL physical layer coding of a Reed-Solomon code for error correction and a 1-byte CRC for the detection of any remaining errors not otherwise caught. This scheme has a much more sophisticated error-recovery mechanism than when packets are sent overaSONET linebecauseADSL isamuchnoisier channel. SEC. 3.6 SUMMARY 251 3.6 SUMMARY The task of the data link layer is to convert the raw bit stream offered by the physicallayer intoa stream offrames foruse bythe network layer. Thelinklayer can present this stream with varying levels of reliability, ranging from con- nectionless, unacknowledgedservice toreliable, connection-orientedservice. Various framing methodsare used, including byte count, byte stuffing, and bit stuffing. Data link protocols can provide error control to detect or correct dam- aged frames and toretransmit lost frames. To prevent a fast sender from overrun- ningaslow receiver,the data link protocol can also provide flow control. The sli- dingwindowmechanism iswidely used tointegrate error control and flow control inasimple way. When thewindowsize is1packet, theprotocol isstop-and-wait. Codes for error correction and detection add redundant information to mes- sages by using a variety of mathematical techniques. Convolutional codes and Reed-Solomon codes are widely deployed for error correction, with low-density parity check codes increasing in popularity. The codes for error detection that are usedinpractice include cyclic redundancychecks and checksums. All these codes can beapplied atthelinklayer, aswell asatthephysicallayer andhigher layers. We examined a series of protocols that provide a reliable link layer using ac- knowledgements and retransmissions, or ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest), under more realistic assumptions. Starting from an error-free environment in which the receiver can handle any frame sent to it, we introduced flow control, followed by error control with sequence numbers and the stop-and-wait algorithm. Then we used the sliding window algorithm to allow bidirectional communication and introduce the concept of piggybacking. The last two protocols pipeline the trans- mission of multiple frames to prevent the sender from blocking on a link with a long propagation delay. The receiver can either discard all frames other than the next one in sequence, or buffer out-of-order frames and send negative acknowl- edgements for greater bandwidth efficiency. The former strategy is a go-back-n protocol, andthelatter strategy isaselective repeat protocol', 'The Internet uses PPP as the main data link protocol over point-to-point lines. It provides a connectionless unacknowledged service, using flag bytes to delimit frames and aCRCforerror detection.

The goal of this lab exercise is to implement an error-detection mechanism using the standard CRC algorithm described in the text. Write two programs, generator and verifier. The generator program reads from standard input a line of ASCII text con- taining an n-bit message consisting of a string of 0sand 1s. The secondline is the k- bitpolynomial,also in ASCII. It outputs to standard output a line of ASCII text with n +k 0s and 1s representing the message to be transmitted. Then it outputs the poly- nomial, just as it read it in. The verifier program reads in the output of the generator programandoutputsamessageindicatingwhetheritiscorrect ornot. Finally,writea program, alter, that inverts 1 bit on the first line depending on its argument (the bit number counting the leftmost bit as 1) but copies the rest of the two lines correctly.

This page intentionally left blank 4 THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER Network links can be divided into two categories: those using point-to-point connections and those using broadcast channels. We studied point-to-point links inChap. 2;thischapter deals withbroadcast linksandtheir protocols. In any broadcast network, the key issue is how to determine who gets to use the channel when there is competition for it. To make this point, consider a con- ference call in which six people, on six different telephones, are all connected so that each one can hear and talk to all the others. It is very likely that when one of them stops speaking, two or more will start talking at once, leading to chaos. In a face-to-face meeting, chaos isavoided byexternal means. For example, at a meet- ing, people raise their hands to request permission to speak. When only a single channel is available, it is much harder to determine who should go next. Many protocols forsolving the problem are known.They form the contents of this chap- ter. In the literature, broadcast channels are sometimes referred to as multiaccess channels orrandom accesschannels. The protocols used to determine who goes next on a multiaccess channel be- long to a sublayer of the data link layer called the MAC (Medium Access Con- trol) sublayer. The MAC sublayer is especially important in LANs, particularly wireless ones because wireless is naturally a broadcast channel. WANs, in con- trast, use point-to-point links, except for satellite networks. Because multiaccess channels and LANs are so closely related, in this chapter we willdiscuss LANs in 257 258 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 general, including a few issues that are not strictly part of the MAC sublayer, but themainsubject here willbecontrol ofthechannel. Technically, the MAC sublayer is the bottom part of the data link layer, so logically we should have studied it before examining all the point-to-point proto- cols inChap. 3. Nevertheless, formost people, it is easier tounderstand protocols involving multiple parties after two-party protocols are well understood. For that reason wehavedeviated slightlyfromastrict bottom-uporder ofpresentation', '4.1 THE CHANNEL ALLOCATION PROBLEM The central theme ofthis chapter ishowtoallocate a single broadcast channel among competing users. The channel might be a portion of the wireless spectrum in a geographic region, or a single wire or optical fiber to which multiple nodes are connected.It does notmatter. Inbothcases, the channel connectseachuserto all other users and any user who makes full use of the channel interferes with other userswhoalsowishtousethechannel. We will first look at the shortcomings of static allocation schemes for bursty traffic. Then, we will lay out the key assumptions used to model the dynamic schemes thatweexamine inthefollowingsections. 4.1.1 Static Channel Allocation The traditional way of allocating a single channel, such as a telephone trunk, among multiple competing users is to chop up its capacity by using one of the multiplexingschemes wedescribed inSec. 2.5,suchasFDM(Frequency Division Multiplexing). If there are N users, the bandwidth is divided into N equal-sized portions, with eachuser being assigned one portion. Since each user has a private frequency band, there is now no interference among users. When there is only a small and constant number of users, each of which has a steady stream or a heavy load of traffic, this division is a simple and efficient allocation mechanism. A wireless example is FM radio stations. Each station gets a portion of the FM band andusesitmostofthetime tobroadcast itssignal. However, when the number of senders is large and varying or the traffic is bursty, FDMpresents someproblems. Ifthespectrum iscutupintoNregionsand fewer than N users are currently interested in communicating, a large piece of valuable spectrum will be wasted. And if more than N users want to communi- cate, some of them will be denied permission for lack of bandwidth, even if some of the users who have been assigned a frequency band hardly ever transmit or re- ceive anything. Even assumingthatthenumberofusers couldsomehow beheldconstant at N, dividing the single available channel into some number of static subchannels is SEC. 4.1 THECHANNELALLOCATION PROBLEM 259 inherently inefficient. The basic problem is that when some users are quiescent, their bandwidth issimply lost. They are notusingit, and nooneelse isallowed to use it either. A static allocation is a poor fit to most computer systems, in which data traffic is extremely bursty, often with peak traffic to mean traffic ratios of 1000:1. Consequently, mostofthechannels willbeidlemostofthetime. The poor performance of static FDM can easily be seen with a simple queue- ing theory calculation. Let us start by finding the mean time delay, T, to send a frame onto a channel of capacity C bps. We assume that the frames arrive ran- domly with an average arrival rate of λ frames/sec, and that the frames vary in length with an average length of 1/μ bits. With these parameters, the service rate ofthechannel isμCframes/sec. Astandard queueing theoryresult is 1 T = μC −λ (For the curious, this result is for an ‘‘M/M/1’’ queue', 'It requires that the ran- domness of the times between frame arrivals and the frame lengths follow an exponentialdistribution, orequivalently betheresult ofaPoisson process.) In our example, if C is 100 Mbps, the mean frame length, 1/μ, is 10,000 bits, and the frame arrival rate, λ, is 5000 frames/sec, then T =200μsec. Note that if we ignored the queueing delay and just asked how long it takes to send a 10,000- bit frame on a 100-Mbps network, we would get the (incorrect) answer of 100 μsec. That result onlyholdswhenthere isnocontention forthechannel. Now let us divide the single channel into N independent subchannels, each with capacity C/N bps. The mean input rate on each of the subchannels will now beλ/N. Recomputing T,weget 1 N T = = = NT (4-1) N μ(C/N)−(λ/N) μC −λ The mean delay for the divided channel is N times worse than if all the frames were somehow magically arranged orderlyinabigcentral queue. Thissame result says that a bank lobby full of ATM machines is better off having a single queue feeding allthemachines thanaseparate queue infrontofeachmachine. Precisely the same arguments that apply to FDM also apply to other ways of statically dividing the channel. If we were to use time division multiplexing (TDM) and allocate each user every Nth time slot, if a user does not use the allo- cated slot, it would just lie fallow. The same would hold if we split up the net- works physically. Using our previous example again, if we were to replace the 100-Mbps network with 10 networks of 10 Mbps each and statically allocate each usertooneofthem, themean delay wouldjumpfrom200μsec to2msec. Since noneofthetraditionalstatic channel allocation methodsworkwell atall withburstytraffic, wewillnowexplore dynamicmethods. 260 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 4.1.2 Assumptions for Dynamic Channel Allocation Before wegettothefirstofthemanychannel allocation methodsinthischap- ter, it is worthwhile to carefully formulate the allocation problem. Underlying all theworkdoneinthisarea are thefollowing fivekeyassumptions: 1. Independent Traffic. The model consists of N independent stations (e.g., computers, telephones),eachwithaprogram oruserthatgener- ates frames for transmission. The expected number of frames gener- ated inan interval of length Δt is λΔt, where λisaconstant (the arri- val rate of new frames). Once a frame has been generated, the sta- tion is blocked and does nothing until the frame has been suc- cessfully transmitted. 2. Single Channel. A single channel is available for all communica- tion. All stations can transmit on it and all can receive from it. The stations are assumed to be equally capable, though protocols may assignthemdifferent roles(e.g., priorities). 3. Observable Collisions. If two frames are transmitted simultan- eously, they overlap in time and the resulting signal is garbled. This event is called a collision. All stations can detect that a collision has occurred. A collided frame must be transmitted again later. No er- rorsother thanthosegenerated bycollisionsoccur. 4. Continuous or Slotted Time. Time may be assumed continuous, in which case frame transmission can begin at any instant. Alterna- tively, time may be slotted or divided into discrete intervals (called slots). Frame transmissions must then begin at the start of a slot. A slotmaycontain 0,1,ormore frames, correspondingtoan idle slot, a successfultransmission, oracollision,respectively. 5', 'Carrier Sense or No Carrier Sense. With the carrier sense as- sumption, stations can tell ifthe channel isinuse before trying touse it. No station will attempt to use the channel while it is sensed as busy. If there is no carrier sense, stations cannot sense the channel before trying to use it. They just go ahead and transmit. Only later can theydetermine whether thetransmission wassuccessful. Some discussion of these assumptions is in order. The first one says that frame arrivals are independent, bothacross stations and at a particular station, and that frames are generated unpredictably but at a constant rate. Actually, this as- sumption is not a particularly good model of network traffic, as it is well known that packets come in bursts over a range of time scales (Paxson and Floyd, 1995; and Leland et al., 1994). Nonetheless, Poisson models, as they are frequently called, are useful because they are mathematically tractable. They help us analyze SEC. 4.1 THECHANNELALLOCATION PROBLEM 261 protocols to understand roughly how performance changes over an operating range andhowitcompares withother designs. The single-channel assumption is the heart of the model. No external ways to communicate exist. Stations cannot raise their hands to request that the teacher call onthem, sowewillhavetocome upwithbetter solutions. The remaining three assumptions depend on the engineering of the system, andwewillsaywhichassumptions holdwhenweexamine aparticular protocol. The collision assumption is basic. Stations need some way to detect collisions if they are to retransmit frames rather than let them be lost. For wired channels, node hardware can be designed to detect collisions when they occur. The stations can then terminate their transmissions prematurely to avoid wasting capacity. This detection is much harder for wireless channels, so collisions are usually inferred after the fact by the lack of an expected acknowledgement frame. It is also possible for some frames involved in a collision to be successfully received, depending on the details of the signals and the receiving hardware. However, this situation is not the common case, so we will assume that all frames involved in a collision are lost. We will also see protocols that are designed to prevent collis- ionsfromoccurring inthefirstplace. The reason for the two alternative assumptions about time is that slotted time can be used toimprove performance. However, itrequires the stations tofollow a master clock or synchronize their actions with each other to divide time into dis- crete intervals. Hence, it is not always available. We will discuss and analyze systems withbothkindsoftime. Foragivensystem, onlyoneofthemholds. Similarly, a network may have carrier sensing or not have it. Wired networks will generally have carrier sense. Wireless networks cannot always use it ef- fectively because not every station may be within radio range of every other sta- tion. Similarly, carrier sense will not be available inother settings in which a sta- tion cannot communicate directly with other stations, for example a cable modem in which stations must communicate via the cable headend', 'Note that the word ‘‘carrier’’ in this sense refers toa signal onthe channel and has nothing to dowith the common carriers (e.g., telephone companies) that date back to the days of the PonyExpress. To avoid any misunderstanding, it is worth noting that no multiaccess proto- col guarantees reliable delivery. Even in the absence of collisions, the receiver may have copied some of the frame incorrectly for various reasons. Other parts of thelinklayer orhigher layers provide reliability. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESS PROTOCOLS Many algorithms for allocating a multiple access channel are known. In the following sections, we will study a small sample of the more interesting ones and givesome examples ofhowtheyare commonlyusedinpractice. 262 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 4.2.1 ALOHA The story of our first MAC starts out in pristine Hawaii in the early 1970s. In this case, ‘‘pristine’’ can be interpreted as ‘‘not having a working telephone sys- tem.’’ This did not make life more pleasant for researcher Norman Abramson and his colleagues at the University ofHawaii whowere trying toconnectusers onre- mote islands to the main computer in Honolulu. Stringing their own cables under thePacific Oceanwasnotinthecards, sotheylookedforadifferent solution. The one they found used short-range radios, with each user terminal sharing the same upstream frequency to send frames to the central computer. It included a simple and elegant method to solve the channel allocation problem. Their work has been extended by many researchers since then (Schwartz and Abramson, 2009). Although Abramson’s work, called the ALOHA system, used ground- based radio broadcasting, the basic idea is applicable to any system in which uncoordinated users are competing fortheuseofasingle shared channel. We will discuss two versions of ALOHA here: pure and slotted. They differ with respect to whether time is continuous, as in the pure version, or divided into discrete slotsintowhichallframes mustfit. Pure ALOHA The basic idea of an ALOHA system is simple: let users transmit whenever they have data to be sent. There will be collisions, of course, and the colliding frames willbe damaged. Senders need some way tofindoutif this is the case. In the ALOHA system, after each station has sent its frame to the central computer, this computer rebroadcasts the frame to all of the stations. A sending station can thuslisten forthe broadcast fromthe hubtosee ifitsframe has gottenthrough. In other systems, such as wired LANs, the sender might be able to listen for collis- ionswhile transmitting. Iftheframe was destroyed, thesender just waits a randomamountoftime and sends it again. The waiting time must be random or the same frames will collide over and over, in lockstep. Systems in which multiple users share a common channel inawaythatcan lead toconflicts are knownascontention systems. A sketch of frame generation in an ALOHA system is given in Fig.4-1. We have made the frames all the same length because the throughputof ALOHA sys- tems is maximized by having a uniform frame size rather than by allowing vari- able-length frames. Whenever two frames try to occupy the channel at the same time, there will be a collision (as seen in Fig.4-1) and both will be garbled', 'If the first bit of a new frame overlaps with just the last bit of a frame that has almost finished, both frames will be totally destroyed (i.e., have incorrect checksums) and both will have to be retransmitted later. The checksum does not (and should not) distin- guishbetween atotal lossandanear miss. Badisbad. SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 263 User A B C D E Collision Time Collision Figure4-1. InpureALOHA,framesaretransmittedatcompletelyarbitrarytimes. An interesting question is: what is the efficiency of an ALOHA channel? In other words, what fraction of all transmitted frames escape collisions under these chaotic circumstances? Let us first consider an infinite collection of users typing at their terminals (stations). A user is always in one of two states: typing or wait- ing. Initially, all users are in the typing state. When a line is finished, the user stops typing, waiting for a response. The station then transmits a frame con- taining the line over the shared channel to the central computer and checks the channel to see if it was successful. If so, the user sees the reply and goes back to typing. If not, the user continues to wait while the station retransmits the frame overandoveruntilithasbeen successfullysent. Let the ‘‘frame time’’ denote the amount of time needed to transmit the stan- dard, fixed-length frame (i.e., the frame length divided by the bit rate). At this point, we assume that the new frames generated by the stations are well modeled by a Poisson distribution with a mean of N frames per frame time. (The infinite- population assumption is needed to ensure that N does not decrease as users be- come blocked.) If N >1, the user community is generating frames at a higher rate than the channel can handle, and nearly every frame will suffer a collision. Forreasonable throughput,wewouldexpect 0<N <1. In addition to the new frames, the stations also generate retransmissions of frames that previously suffered collisions. Let us further assume that the old and new frames combined are well modeled bya Poisson distribution, with mean of G frames per frame time. Clearly, G ≥N. At low load (i.e., N ∼∼0), there will be few collisions, hence few retransmissions, so G ∼∼N. At high load, there will be many collisions, so G >N. Under all loads, the throughput, S, is just the offered load, G, times the probability, P , of a transmission succeeding—that is, 0 S =GP , where P istheprobabilitythataframe doesnotsuffer acollision. 0 0 A frame will not suffer a collision if no other frames are sent within one frame time of its start, as shown in Fig.4-2. Under what conditions will the 264 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 shaded frame arrive undamaged? Let tbe the time required to send one frame. If any other user has generated a frame between time t and t +t, the end of that 0 0 frame will collide with the beginning of the shaded one', 'In fact, the shaded frame’s fate was already sealed even before thefirstbitwas sent, butsince inpure ALOHA a station does not listen to the channel before transmitting, it has no way of knowing that another frame was already underway. Similarly, any other frame started between t +tandt +2twillbumpintotheendoftheshaded frame. 0 0 Collideswith Collideswith thestartof theendof theshaded theshaded t frame frame t t +t t +2t t +3t Time 0 0 0 0 Vulnerable Figure4-2. Vulnerableperiodfortheshadedframe. The probability that k frames are generated during a given frame time, in whichGframes are expected, isgivenbythePoissondistribution Gk e −G Pr[k]= (4-2) k! so the probability of zero frames is just e −G. In an interval two frame times long, the mean number of frames generated is 2G. The probability of no frames being initiated during the entire vulnerable period is thus given by P =e −2G. Using 0 S =GP , weget 0 S =Ge −2G The relation between the offered traffic and the throughput is shown in Fig.4-3. The maximum throughput occurs at G =0.5, withS =1/2e, which is about 0.184. In other words, the best we can hope for is a channel utilization of 18%. This result is not very encouraging, but with everyone transmitting at will, wecouldhardly have expected a100%successrate. Slotted ALOHA Soon after ALOHA came onto the scene, Roberts (1972) published a method for doubling the capacity of an ALOHA system. His proposal was to divide time into discrete intervals called slots, each interval corresponding toone frame. This SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 265 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0 G(attemptsperpackettime) )emitemarfreptuphguorht(S SlottedALOHA:S=Ge–G PureALOHA:S=Ge–2G Figure4-3. ThroughputversusofferedtrafficforALOHAsystems. approach requires the users to agree on slot boundaries. One way to achieve syn- chronization wouldbe tohave one special station emit apipatthestart ofeachin- terval, likeaclock. In Roberts’ method, which has come to be known as slotted ALOHA—in contrast to Abramson’s pure ALOHA—a station is not permitted to send when- ever the user types a line. Instead, it is required to wait for the beginning of the next slot. Thus, the continuous time ALOHA is turned into a discrete time one. This halves the vulnerable period. To see this, look at Fig. 4-3 and imagine the collisions that are now possible. The probability of no other traffic during the same slotasourtestframe isthene −G,whichleads to S =Ge −G (4-3) As you can see from Fig.4-3, slotted ALOHA peaks at G = 1, with a throughput of S = 1/e or about 0.368, twice that of pure ALOHA. If the system is operating at G =1, the probability of an empty slot is 0.368 (from Eq. 4-2). The best we can hope for using slotted ALOHA is 37% of the slots empty, 37% successes, and 26% collisions. Operating at higher values of G reduces the number of empties but increases the number of collisions exponentially. To see how this rapid growth of collisions with G comes about, consider the transmission of a test frame', 'The probability that it will avoid a collision is e −G, which is the probabil- ity that all the other stations are silent inthat slot. The probabilityof a collision is then just 1−e −G. The probability of a transmission requiring exactly k attempts (i.e., k −1collisionsfollowed byonesuccess)is P =e −G(1−e −G)k−1 k The expected number oftransmissions, E,perlinetypedataterminal isthen ∞ ∞ E = Σ kP = Σ ke −G(1−e −G)k−1 = eG k k=1 k=1 266 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 As a result of the exponential dependence of E upon G, small increases in the channel loadcan drastically reduce itsperformance. Slotted ALOHA is notable for a reason that may not be initially obvious. It was devised in the 1970s, used in a few early experimental systems, then almost forgotten. When Internet accessoverthecable was invented, all ofasuddenthere was a problem of how to allocate a shared channel among multiple competing users. Slotted ALOHA was pulled out of the garbage can to save the day. Later, having multiple RFID tags talk to the same RFID reader presented another varia- tion on the same problem. Slotted ALOHA, with a dash of other ideas mixed in, again came to the rescue. It has often happened that protocols that are perfectly valid fall into disuse forpoliticalreasons (e.g., some big company wants everyone to do things its way) or due to ever-changing technology trends. Then, years later some clever person realizes that along-discardedprotocol solves his current prob- lem. For this reason, in this chapter we will study a number of elegant protocols that are notcurrently inwidespread use butmight easily beused in future applica- tions, provided that enough network designers are aware of them. Of course, we willalsostudymanyprotocols thatare incurrent useaswell. 4.2.2 Carrier Sense Multiple Access Protocols With slotted ALOHA, the best channel utilization that can be achieved is 1/e. This low result is hardly surprising, since with stations transmitting at will, with- out knowing what the other stations are doing there are bound to be many collis- ions. In LANs, however, it is often possible for stations to detect what other sta- tions are doing, and thus adapt their behavior accordingly. These networks can achieve a much better utilization than 1/e. In this section, we will discuss some protocols forimprovingperformance. Protocols in which stations listen for a carrier (i.e., a transmission) and act accordingly are called carrier sense protocols. A number of them have been proposed, and they were long ago analyzed in detail. For example, see Kleinrock and Tobagi (1975). Below we will look at several versions of carrier sense proto- cols. Persistent and Nonpersistent CSMA The first carrier sense protocol that we will study here is called 1-persistent CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access). That isabit ofa mouthfulforthesim- plest CSMA scheme. When a station has data to send, it first listens to the chan- nel to see if anyone else is transmitting at that moment. If the channel is idle, the stations sends its data. Otherwise, if the channel is busy, the station just waits until it becomes idle. Then the station transmits a frame', 'If a collision occurs, the SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 267 station waits a random amount of time and starts all over again. The protocol is called 1-persistent because the station transmits with a probability of 1 when it findsthechannel idle. You might expect that this scheme avoids collisions except for the rare case of simultaneous sends, but it in fact it does not. If two stations become ready in the middle of a third station’s transmission, both will wait politely until the trans- mission ends, and then both will begin transmitting exactly simultaneously, re- sulting in a collision. If they were not so impatient, there would be fewer collis- ions. More subtly, the propagation delay has an important effect on collisions. There is a chance that just after a station begins sending, another station will be- come ready to send and sense the channel. If the first station’s signal has not yet reached the second one, the latter will sense an idle channel and will also begin sending, resulting in a collision. This chance depends on the number of frames that fit on the channel, or the bandwidth-delay product of the channel. If onlya tiny fraction of a frame fits on the channel, which is the case in most LANs since the propagation delay is small, the chance of a collision happening is small. The larger the bandwidth-delay product, the more important this effect becomes, and theworse theperformance oftheprotocol. Even so,this protocol has better performance than pure ALOHAbecause both stations have the decency to desist from interfering with the third station’s frame. Exactly thesame holdsforslotted ALOHA. A second carrier sense protocol is nonpersistent CSMA. In this protocol, a conscious attempt ismade tobe less greedy than inthe previousone. Asbefore, a station senses the channel when it wants to send a frame, and if no one else is sending, the station begins doing so itself. However, if the channel is already in use, the station does not continually sense it for the purpose of seizing it im- mediately upon detecting the end of the previous transmission. Instead, it waits a random period of time and then repeats the algorithm. Consequently, this algo- rithm leads to better channel utilization but longer delays than 1-persistent CSMA. The last protocol is p-persistent CSMA. It applies to slotted channels and worksas follows. When a station becomes ready tosend,itsenses thechannel. If it is idle, it transmits with a probability p. With a probability q =1−p, it defers until the next slot. If that slot is also idle, it either transmits or defers again, with probabilities p and q. This process is repeated until either the frame has been transmitted or another station has begun transmitting. In the latter case, the unlucky station acts as if there had been a collision (i.e., it waits a random time and starts again). If the station initially senses that the channel is busy, it waits untilthe next slot andapplies the abovealgorithm. IEEE802.11uses a refinement ofp-persistent CSMA thatwewilldiscuss inSec. 4.4', 'Figure 4-4 shows the computed throughput versus offered traffic for all three protocols, aswell asforpureandslotted ALOHA. 268 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 )emittekcapreptuphguorht(S 0.01-persistentCSMA NonpersistentCSMA 0.1-persistentCSMA 0.5-persistent CSMA Slotted ALOHA 1-persistent Pure CSMA ALOHA G(attemptsperpackettime) Figure4-4. Comparison of the channel utilization versus load for various ran- domaccessprotocols. CSMA with CollisionDetection Persistent and nonpersistent CSMA protocols are definitely an improvement over ALOHA because they ensure that no station begins to transmit while the channel is busy. However, if two stations sense the channel to be idle and begin transmitting simultaneously, their signals will still collide. Another improvement is for the stations to quickly detect the collision and abruptly stop transmitting, (rather than finishing them) since they are irretrievably garbled anyway. This strategy saves time andbandwidth. This protocol, known as CSMA/CD (CSMA with Collision Detection), is the basisoftheclassic Ethernet LAN, soitisworthdevotingsometime tolooking at it in detail. It is important to realize that collision detection is an analog proc- ess. The station’s hardware must listen to the channel while it is transmitting. If the signal it reads back is different from the signal it is putting out, it knows that a collision is occurring. The implications are that a receivedsignal must notbetiny compared tothe transmittedsignal (which isdifficult forwireless, as received sig- nals may be 1,000,000 times weaker than transmitted signals) and that the modu- lation must be chosen to allow collisions to be detected (e.g., a collision of two 0- voltsignals maywell beimpossible todetect). CSMA/CD, as well as many other LAN protocols, uses the conceptual model of Fig.4-5. At the point marked t , a station has finished transmitting its frame. 0 Any other station having a frame to send may now attempt to do so. If two or more stations decide to transmit simultaneously, there willbe a collision. If a sta- tion detects a collision, it aborts its transmission, waits a random period of time, and then tries again (assuming that no other station has started transmitting in the SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 269 meantime). Therefore, our model for CSMA/CD will consist of alternating con- tention and transmission periods, with idle periods occurring when all stations are quiet(e.g., forlack ofwork). Contention t o slots Frame Frame Frame Frame Transmission Contention Idle period period period Time Figure4-5. CSMA/CDcanbeincontention,transmission,oridlestate. Now let us look at the details of the contention algorithm. Suppose that two stations both begin transmitting at exactly time t . How long will it take them to 0 realize that they have collided? The answer is vital to determining the length of thecontention period andhence what thedelay andthroughputwillbe. The minimum time to detect the collision is just the time it takes the signal to propagate from one station to the other. Based on this information, you might think that a station that has not heard a collision for a time equal to the full cable propagation time after starting its transmission can be sure it has seized the cable', 'By ‘‘seized,’’ we mean that all other stations know it is transmitting and will not interfere. Thisconclusion iswrong. Consider the following worst-case scenario. Let the time for a signal to pro- pagate between the two farthest stations be τ. At t , one station begins trans- 0 mitting. At t +τ−ε, an instant before the signal arrives at the most distant sta- 0 tion, that station also begins transmitting. Of course, it detects the collision al- most instantly and stops, but the little noise burst caused by the collision does not get back to the original station until time 2τ−ε. In other words, inthe worst case astation cannotbesurethat ithas seized the channel untilit has transmittedfor2τ withouthearing acollision. With this understanding, we can think of CSMA/CD contention as a slotted ALOHA system with a slot width of 2τ. On a 1-km long coaxial cable, τ∼∼5μsec. The difference for CSMA/CD compared to slotted ALOHA is that slots in which only one station transmits (i.e., in which the channel is seized) are followed bythe rest ofaframe. This difference will greatly improve performance iftheframe timeismuchlongerthanthepropagation time. 4.2.3 Collision-Free Protocols Although collisions do not occur with CSMA/CD once a station has unambi- guously captured the channel, they can still occur during the contention period. These collisions adversely affect the system performance, especially when the 270 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 bandwidth-delay product is large, such as when the cable is long(i.e., large τ)and the frames are short. Not only do collisions reduce bandwidth, but they make the time to send a frame variable, which is not a good fit for real-time traffic such as voice overIP. CSMA/CD isalsonotuniversally applicable. Inthissection, we willexamine some protocols that resolve the contention for the channel without any collisions at all, not even during the contention period. Most of these protocols are not currently used in major systems, but in a rapidly changing field, having some protocols with excellent properties available for fu- ture systems isoften agoodthing. In the protocols to be described, we assume that there are exactly N stations, each programmed with a unique address from 0 to N −1. It does not matter that some stations may be inactive part of the time. We also assume that propagation delay is negligible. The basic question remains: which station gets the channel after a successful transmission? We continue using the model of Fig.4-5 with its discrete contention slots. ABit-Map Protocol In our first collision-free protocol, the basic bit-map method, each con- tention period consists of exactly Nslots. Ifstation 0has aframe tosend, ittrans- mits a 1 bit during the slot 0. No other station is allowed to transmit during this slot. Regardless ofwhat station 0does,station 1getstheopportunitytotransmit a 1 bit during slot 1, but only if it has a frame queued. In general, station j may announce that it has a frame to send by inserting a 1 bit into slot j. After all N slots have passed by, each station has complete knowledge of which stations wish to transmit. At that point, they begin transmitting frames in numerical order (see Fig.4-6)', 'Frames 8Contentionslots 8Contentionslots 1 d 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 1 1 3 7 1 1 1 5 1 2 Figure4-6. Thebasicbit-mapprotocol. Since everyone agrees on who goes next, there will never be any collisions. After the last ready station has transmitteditsframe, anevent allstations can easi- ly monitor, another N-bit contention period is begun. If a station becomes ready just after its bit slot has passed by, it is out of luck and must remain silent until every station hashadachance andthebitmaphascome aroundagain. SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 271 Protocols like this in which the desire to transmit is broadcast before the ac- tual transmission are called reservation protocols because they reserve channel ownership in advance and prevent collisions. Let us briefly analyze the perfor- mance of this protocol. For convenience, we will measure time in units of the contention bitslot,withdata frames consisting ofdtime units. Under conditions of low load, the bit map will simply be repeated over and over, for lack of data frames. Consider the situation from the point of view of a low-numbered station, such as 0 or 1. Typically, when it becomes ready to send, the ‘‘current’’ slot will be somewhere in the middle of the bit map. On average, the station will have to wait N/2 slots for the current scan to finish and another full N slots for the following scan to run to completion before it may begin trans- mitting. The prospects for high-numbered stations are brighter. Generally, these will only have to wait half a scan (N/2 bit slots) before starting to transmit. High- numbered stations rarely have to wait for the next scan. Since low-numbered sta- tions must wait on average 1.5N slots and high-numbered stations must wait on average 0.5Nslots,themean forallstations isNslots. The channel efficiency at low load is easy to compute. The overhead per frame isNbitsandtheamountofdata isdbits,foranefficiency ofd/(d +N). At highload, when all the stations have something to send all the time, the N- bit contention period is prorated over N frames, yielding an overhead of only 1bit per frame, or an efficiency of d/(d +1). The mean delay for a frame is equal to the sum of the time it queues inside its station, plus an additional (N −1)d +N once it gets to the head of its internal queue. This interval is how long it takes to wait forallother stations tohave their turnsendingaframe andanother bitmap. Token Passing The essence of the bit-map protocol is that it lets every station transmit a frame in turn in a predefined order. Another way to accomplish the same thing is to pass a small message called a token from one station to the next in the same predefined order. The token represents permission to send. If a station has a frame queued for transmission when it receives the token, it can send that frame before it passes the token to the next station. If it has no queued frame, it simply passes thetoken', 'In a token ring protocol, the topology of the network is used to define the order in which stations send. The stations are connectedone tothe next inasingle ring. Passing the token to the next station then simply consists of receiving the token infromonedirection andtransmittingitoutintheother direction, asseen in Fig.4-7. Frames are also transmitted in the direction of the token. This way they will circulate around the ring and reach whichever station isthe destination. How- ever, to stop the frame circulating indefinitely (like the token), some station needs 272 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 to remove it from the ring. This station may be either the one that originally sent the frame, after it has gone through a complete cycle, or the station that was the intended recipient oftheframe. Station Token Directionof transmission Figure4-7. Tokenring. Note that we do not need a physical ring to implement token passing. The channel connecting the stations might instead be a single long bus. Each station then uses the bus to send the token to the next station in the predefined sequence. Possession of the token allows a station to use the bus to send one frame, as be- fore. Thisprotocol iscalled token bus. The performance of token passing is similar to that of the bit-map protocol, though the contention slots and frames of one cycle are now intermingled. After sending a frame, each station must wait for all N stations (including itself) to send the token to their neighbors and the other N −1 stations to send a frame, if they have one. A subtle difference is that, since all positions in the cycle are equiva- lent, there is no bias for low- or high-numbered stations. For token ring, each sta- tion is also sending the token only as far as its neighboring station before the pro- tocol takes the next step. Each token does notneed topropagate toallstations be- foretheprotocol advances tothenextstep. Token rings have cropped up as MAC protocols with some consistency. An early token ring protocol (called ‘‘Token Ring’’ and standardized as IEEE 802.5) was popular in the 1980s as an alternative to classic Ethernet. In the 1990s, a much faster token ring called FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) was beaten out by switched Ethernet. In the 2000s, a token ring called RPR (Resi- lient Packet Ring) was defined as IEEE 802.17 to standardize the mix of metro- politanarea ringsinusebyISPs. Wewonderwhat the2010swillhave tooffer. Binary Countdown A problem with the basic bit-map protocol, and by extension token passing, is that the overhead is 1 bit per station, so it does not scale well to networks with thousands of stations. We can do better than that by using binary station ad- dresses with a channel that combines transmissions. A station wanting to use the SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 273 channel now broadcasts its address as a binary bit string, starting with the high- order bit. All addresses are assumed to be the same length', 'The bits in each ad- dress position from different stations are BOOLEAN ORed together by the chan- nel when they are sent at the same time. We will call this protocol binary count- down. It was used in Datakit (Fraser, 1987). It implicitly assumes that the trans- mission delays are negligible so that all stations see asserted bits essentially in- stantaneously. To avoid conflicts, an arbitration rule must be applied: as soon as a station sees that a high-order bit position that is0inits address has been overwrittenwith a1,itgives up. For example, if stations 0010, 0100, 1001,and 1010are all trying to get the channel, in the first bit time the stations transmit 0, 0, 1, and 1, re- spectively. These are ORed together to form a 1. Stations 0010 and 0100 see the 1 and know that a higher-numbered station is competing for the channel, so they giveupforthecurrent round. Stations 1001and1010continue. The next bit is0,andbothstations continue. The next bit is 1, so station 1001 gives up. The winner is station 1010 because it has the highest address. After winning the bidding, it may now transmit a frame, after which another bidding cycle starts. The protocol is illustrated in Fig.4-8. It has the property that high- er-numbered stations have a higher priority than lower-numbered stations, which maybeeither goodorbad,depending onthecontext.

Hopefully, itwillfindanewhomesome day. 274 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 4.2.4 Limited-Contention Protocols We have now considered two basic strategies for channel acquisition in a broadcast network: contention, as in CSMA, and collision-free protocols. Each strategy can be rated as to how well it does with respect to the two important per- formance measures, delay at low load and channel efficiency at high load. Under conditions of light load, contention (i.e., pure or slotted ALOHA) is preferable due to its low delay (since collisions are rare). As the load increases, contention becomes increasingly less attractive becausethe overhead associated with channel arbitration becomes greater. Just the reverse is true for the collision-free proto- cols. At low load, they have relatively high delay but as the load increases, the channel efficiency improves (since theoverheads are fixed). Obviously, it would be nice if we could combine the best properties of the contention and collision-free protocols, arriving at a new protocol that used con- tention at low load to provide low delay, but used a collision-free technique at high load to provide good channel efficiency. Such protocols, which we will call limited-contention protocols,doinfact exist, and willconclude ourstudyofcar- rier sense networks', 'Up to now, the only contention protocols we have studied have been symmet- ric. That is, each station attempts to acquire the channel with some probability, p, with all stations using the same p. Interestingly enough, the overall system per- formance can sometimes be improved by using a protocol that assigns different probabilitiestodifferent stations. Before looking at the asymmetric protocols, let us quickly review the per- formance of the symmetric case. Suppose that k stations are contending for chan- nel access. Each has a probability p of transmitting during each slot. The probability that some station successfully acquires the channel during a given slot is the probability that any one station transmits, with probability p, and all other k −1 stations defer, each with probability 1−p. This value is kp(1−p)k−1. To find the optimal value of p, we differentiate with respect to p, set the result to zero, and solve for p. Doing so, we find that the best value of pis 1/k. Substitut- ingp =1/k,weget ⎧ ⎫k−1 k −1 Pr[successwithoptimal p]= ⎪ ⎪ (4-4) ⎩ k ⎭ This probability is plotted in Fig.4-9. For small numbers of stations, the chances of success are good, but as soon as the number of stations reaches even five, the probabilityhasdroppedclose toitsasymptotic value of1/e. From Fig.4-9, it is fairly obvious that the probability of some station acquir- ing the channel can be increased only by decreasing the amount of competition. The limited-contention protocols do precisely that. They first divide the stations into (not necessarily disjoint) groups. Only the members of group 0 are permitted SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 275 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0 5 10 15 20 25 sseccusfoytilibaborP Numberofreadystations Figure4-9.

If the slot lies fallow or if there is a collision, the members of group1contend for slot 1,etc. By making an appropriate division of stations into groups,the amountofcontention foreach slotcan bereduced, thusoperating each slotnear theleft endofFig. 4-9. The trick ishowtoassignstations toslots. Before lookingat the general case, let us consider some special cases. At one extreme, each group has but one member. Such an assignment guarantees that there will never be collisions be- cause at most one station is contending for any given slot. We have seen such protocols before (e.g., binary countdown). The next special case is to assign two stations per group. The probability that both will try to transmit during a slot is p2, which for a small p is negligible. As more and more stations are assigned to the same slot, the probability of a collision grows, but the length of the bit-map scan needed to give everyone a chance shrinks. The limiting case is a single group containing all stations (i.e., slotted ALOHA). What we need is a way to assign stations to slots dynamically, with many stations per slot when the load is lowandfew (oreven justone)station perslotwhentheloadishigh', 'The Adaptive TreeWalkProtocol One particularly simple way of performing the necessary assignment is to use the algorithm devised by the U.S. Army for testing soldiers for syphilis during World War II (Dorfman, 1943). In short, the Army took a blood sample from N soldiers. A portion of each sample was poured into a single test tube. This mixed sample was then tested for antibodies. If none were found, all the soldiers in the group were declared healthy. If antibodies were present, two new mixed samples 276 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 were prepared, one from soldiers 1 through N/2 and one from the rest. The proc- esswas repeated recursively untiltheinfected soldiers were determined. For the computerized version of this algorithm (Capetanakis, 1979), it is con- venient to think of the stations as the leaves of a binary tree, as illustrated in Fig.4-10. In the first contention slot following a successful frame transmission, slot 0, all stations are permitted to try to acquire the channel. If one of them does so, fine. If there is a collision, then during slot 1 only those stations falling under node 2 in the tree may compete. If one of them acquires the channel, the slot fol- lowing the frame is reserved for those stations under node 3. If, on the other hand, two or more stations under node 2want totransmit, there will be a collision duringslot1,inwhich case itisnode4’sturnduringslot2. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Stations A B C D E F G H Figure4-10. Thetreeforeightstations. Inessence, if acollisionoccurs during slot 0, the entire tree is searched, depth first, to locate all ready stations. Each bit slot is associated with some particular node in the tree. If a collision occurs, the search continues recursively with the node’sleft and rightchildren. Ifabit slotisidle orifonlyone station transmits in it, the searching of its node can stop because all ready stations have been located. (Were there morethanone,there wouldhave been acollision.) When the load onthe system is heavy, it is hardly worth the effort to dedicate slot 0 to node 1 because that makes sense only in the unlikely event that precisely one station has a frame to send. Similarly, one could argue that nodes 2 and 3 shouldbe skipped as well for the same reason. Put inmore general terms, at what level inthe tree shouldthe search begin? Clearly, the heavier the load, the farther down the tree the search should begin. We will assume that each station has a good estimate of the number of ready stations, q, for example, from monitoring recenttraffic. To proceed, let us number the levels of the tree from the top, with node 1 in Fig.4-10 at level 0, nodes 2 and 3 at level 1, etc. Notice that each node at level i SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 277 has a fraction 2 −i of the stations below it. If the q ready stations are uniformly distributed, the expected number of them below a specific node at level i is just 2 −iq', 'Intuitively, we would expect the optimal level to begin searching the tree to be the one at which the mean number of contending stations per slot is 1, that is, thelevel atwhich2 −iq =1. Solvingthisequation, wefindthati =log q. 2 Numerous improvements to the basic algorithm have been discovered and are discussed in some detail by Bertsekas and Gallager (1992). For example, consid- erthecase ofstations GandHbeingtheonlyoneswanting totransmit. Atnode1 a collision will occur, so 2 will be tried and discovered idle. It is pointless to probe node 3 since it is guaranteed to have a collision (we know that two or more stations under 1are ready and none of them are under 2, sothey must all beunder 3). The probe of3can be skipped and6tried next. When this probe also turns up nothing,7canbeskippedandnodeGtried next. 4.2.5 Wireless LAN Protocols Asystem oflaptop computers that communicate byradio can beregarded as a wireless LAN, as we discussed in Sec. 1.5.3. Such a LAN is an example of a broadcast channel. It also has somewhat different properties than a wired LAN, which leads to different MAC protocols. Inthis section, we willexamine some of these protocols. InSec. 4.4,wewilllookat802.11(WiFi) indetail. A common configuration for a wireless LAN is an office building with access points (APs) strategically placed around the building. The APs are wired together using copper or fiber and provide connectivity to the stations that talk to them. If the transmission power of the APs and laptops is adjusted to have a range of tens ofmeters, nearby roomsbecome like a single cell andthe entire building becomes like the cellular telephony systems we studied in Chap. 2, except that each cell only has one channel. This channel is shared by all the stations in the cell, includ- ingtheAP.Ittypically provides megabit/secbandwidths, upto600Mbps. We have already remarked thatwireless systems cannotnormally detect acol- lision while itisoccurring. The receivedsignal atastation maybetiny,perhaps a million times fainter than the signal that is being transmitted. Finding it is like looking for a ripple on the ocean. Instead, acknowledgements are used to dis- cover collisionsandothererrors after thefact. There isaneven moreimportant difference between wireless LANs andwired LANs. A station on a wireless LAN may not be able to transmit frames to or re- ceive frames from all other stations because of the limited radio range of the sta- tions. In wired LANs, when one station sends a frame, all other stations receive it. The absence of this property in wireless LANs causes a variety of complica- tions. We willmake thesimplifying assumption thateachradio transmitterhas some fixed range, represented by a circular coverage region within which another sta- tioncan sense andreceivethestation’s transmission. Itisimportant torealize that 278 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 in practice coverage regions are not nearly so regular because the propagation of radio signals depends on the environment. Walls and other obstacles that attenu- ate and reflect signals may cause the range to differ markedly in different direc- tions.Butasimple circular modelwilldoforourpurposes. A naive approach to using a wireless LAN might be to try CSMA: just listen for other transmissions and only transmit if no one else is doing so', 'The trouble is,thisprotocol isnotreally agoodwaytothinkaboutwireless becausewhat mat- ters for reception is interference at the receiver, not at the sender. To see the na- ture of the problem, consider Fig. 4-11, where four wireless stations are illustrat- ed. For our purposes, it does not matter which are APs and which are laptops. The radio range is such that A and B are within each other’s range and can poten- tially interfere with one another. C can also potentially interfere with both B and D,butnotwithA. A B C D A B C D Radiorange Radiorange (a) (b) Figure4-11. A wireless LAN. (a) A and C are hidden terminals when trans- mittingtoB.(b)BandCareexposedterminalswhentransmittingtoAandD. First consider what happens when A and C transmit to B, as depicted in Fig.4-11(a). If A sends and then C immediately senses the medium, it will not hear AbecauseAisoutofrange. ThusCwillfalsely conclude that it can transmit to B. If C does start transmitting, it will interfere at B, wiping out the frame from A. (We assume here that no CDMA-type scheme is used to provide multiple channels, so collisions garble the signal and destroy both frames.) We want a MAC protocol that will prevent this kind of collision from happening because it wastes bandwidth. The problem of a station not being able to detect a potential competitor for the medium because the competitor is too far away is called the hidden terminal problem. Now let us look at a different situation: B transmitting to A at the same time that Cwants totransmit toD,asshowninFig. 4-11(b). IfCsenses themedium, it will hear a transmission and falsely conclude that it may not send to D (shown as a dashed line). In fact, such a transmission would cause bad reception only in the zone between B and C, where neither of the intended receivers is located. We want a MAC protocol that prevents this kind of deferral from happening because itwastes bandwidth. Theproblem iscalled theexposed terminal problem. The difficulty is that, before starting a transmission, a station really wants to know whether there is radio activity around the receiver. CSMA merely tells it SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESSPROTOCOLS 279 whether there is activity near the transmitter by sensing the carrier. With a wire, all signals propagate to all stations, so this distinction does not exist. However, only one transmission can then take place at once anywhere in the system. In a system based on short-range radio waves, multiple transmissions can occur simul- taneously if they all have different destinations and these destinations are out of range of one another. We want this concurrency to happen as the cell gets larger and larger, in the same way that people at a party should not wait for everyone in the room to go silent before they talk; multiple conversations can take place at once inalarge roomaslongastheyare notdirected tothesame location. An early and influential protocol that tackles these problems for wireless LANs isMACA(Multiple Accesswith CollisionAvoidance)(Karn, 1990)', \"The basic idea behind it is for the sender to stimulate the receiver into outputting a short frame, so stations nearby can detect this transmission and avoid transmitting forthe duration ofthe upcoming (large) data frame. This technique isused instead ofcarrier sense. MACA is illustrated in Fig. 4-12. Let us see how A sends a frame to B. A starts bysending anRTS(Request ToSend)frame toB,asshowninFig. 4-12(a). This short frame (30 bytes) contains the length of the data frame that will eventu- ally follow. Then B replies with a CTS (Clear To Send) frame, as shown in Fig.4-12(b). The CTS frame contains the data length (copied from the RTS frame). UponreceiptoftheCTSframe, Abeginstransmission.

Now let us see how stations overhearing either of these frames react. Any station hearing the RTS is clearly close to A and must remain silent long enough for the CTS to be transmitted back to A without conflict. Any station hearing the CTS is clearly close to B and must remain silent during the upcoming data trans- mission, whose lengthitcantell byexamining theCTSframe. 280 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 In Fig.4-12, C is within range of A but not within range of B. Therefore, it hears theRTSfromAbutnottheCTSfromB. Aslongasitdoesnotinterfere with the CTS, it is free to transmit while the data frame is being sent. In contrast, D is within range of B but not A. It does not hear the RTS but does hear the CTS. Hearing the CTS tips it off that it is close to a station that is about to receive a frame, so it defers sending anything until that frame is expected to be finished. Station E hears both control messages and, like D, must be silent until the data frame iscomplete. Despite these precautions, collisions can still occur. For example, B and C could both sendRTS frames to A at the same time. These will collideand be lost. In the event of a collision, an unsuccessful transmitter (i.e., one that does not hear a CTS within the expected time interval) waits a random amount of time and tries again later. 4.3 ETHERNET We have now finished our discussion of channel allocation protocols in the abstract, so it is time to see how these principles apply to real systems. Many of the designs for personal, local, and metropolitan area networks have been stan- dardized under the name of IEEE 802. A few have survived but many have not, as we saw in Fig. 1-38. Some people who believe in reincarnation think that Charles Darwin came back as a member of the IEEE Standards Association to weed out the unfit. The most important of the survivors are 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.11(wireless LAN). Bluetooth (wireless PAN) iswidely deployed buthasnow been standardized outside of 802.15. With 802.16 (wireless MAN), it is too early totell. Please consult the6theditionofthisbooktofindout. We will begin our studyof real systems with Ethernet, probably the most ubi- quitouskindofcomputer network inthe world\", 'Two kindsofEthernet exist: clas- sic Ethernet, which solves the multiple access problem using the techniques we have studied in this chapter; and switched Ethernet, in which devices called switches are used to connect different computers. It is important to note that, while they are both referred to as Ethernet, they are quite different. Classic Ether- net is the original form and ran at rates from 3 to 10 Mbps. Switched Ethernet is what Ethernet has become and runs at 100, 1000, and 10,000 Mbps, in forms call- ed fast Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, and 10 gigabit Ethernet. In practice, only switched Ethernet isusednowadays. We will discuss these historical forms of Ethernet in chronological order showing howthey developed. Since Ethernet andIEEE802.3are identical except for a minor difference (which we will discuss shortly), many people use the terms ‘‘Ethernet’’ and ‘‘IEEE 802.3’’ interchangeably. We will do so, too. For more information aboutEthernet, see Spurgeon (2000). SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 281 4.3.1 Classic Ethernet Physical Layer The story of Ethernet starts about the same time as that of ALOHA, when a student named Bob Metcalfe got his bachelor’s degree at M.I.T. and then moved up the river to get his Ph.D. at Harvard. During his studies, he was exposed to Abramson’s work. He became so interested in it that after graduating from Har- vard, he decided to spend the summer in Hawaii working with Abramson before starting work at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center). When he got to PARC, he saw that the researchers there had designed and built what would later be called personal computers. But the machines were isolated. Using his knowl- edge of Abramson’s work, he, together with his colleague David Boggs, designed and implemented the first local area network (Metcalfe and Boggs, 1976). It used asingle long,thickcoaxial cable andranat3Mbps. They called the system Ethernet after the luminiferous ether, through which electromagnetic radiation was once thoughttopropagate. (When the 19th-century British physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovered that electromagnetic radiation could be described by a wave equation, scientists assumed that space must be filled with some ethereal medium in which the radiation was propagating. Only after the famous Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 did physicists discover thatelectromagnetic radiation couldpropagate inavacuum.) The Xerox Ethernet was so successful that DEC, Intel, and Xerox drew up a standard in1978for a 10-Mbps Ethernet, called the DIX standard. With a minor change, the DIX standard became the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983. Unfor- tunately for Xerox, it already had a history of making seminal inventions (such as the personal computer) and then failing to commercialize on them, a story told in Fumbling the Future (Smith and Alexander, 1988). When Xerox showed little interest in doing anything with Ethernet other than helping standardize it, Metcalfe formed his own company, 3Com, to sell Ethernet adapters for PCs. It soldmanymillionsofthem. Classic Ethernet snaked aroundthebuildingasasingle longcable towhich all the computers were attached. This architecture is shown in Fig.4-13. The first variety, popularly called thick Ethernet, resembled a yellow garden hose, with markings every 2.5 meters to show where to attach computers', '(The 802.3 stan- dard did not actually require the cable to be yellow, but it did suggest it.) It was succeeded by thin Ethernet, which bent more easily and made connections using industry-standard BNC connectors. Thin Ethernet was much cheaper and easier to install, but it could run for only 185 meters per segment (instead of 500 m with thickEthernet), eachofwhichcouldhandle only30machines (instead of100). Each version of Ethernet has a maximum cable length per segment (i.e., unamplified length) over which the signal will propagate. To allow larger net- works, multiple cables can be connected by repeaters. A repeater is a physical layer device that receives, amplifies (i.e., regenerates), and retransmits signals in both directions. As far as the software is concerned, a series of cable segments 282 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 Transceiver Interface cable Ether Figure4-13. Architecture ofclassicEthernet. connected by repeaters is no different from a single cable (except for a small amountofdelay introducedbytherepeaters). Over each of these cables, information was sent using the Manchester encod- ingwe studied inSec. 2.5.AnEthernet could contain multiplecable segments and multiple repeaters, but no two transceivers could be more than 2.5 km apart and no path between any two transceivers could traverse more than four repeaters. The reason for this restriction was so that the MAC protocol, which we will look atnext, wouldworkcorrectly. 4.3.2 Classic Ethernet MAC Sublayer Protocol The format used to send frames is shown in Fig. 4-14. First comes a Pream- ble of 8bytes, each containing the bit pattern 10101010(with the exception of the last byte, inwhich the last 2bits are set to 11). This last byte is called the Start of Frame delimiter for 802.3. The Manchester encoding of this pattern produces a 10-MHz square wave for 6.4 μsec to allow the receiver’s clock to synchronize with the sender’s. The last two 1 bits tell the receiver that the rest of the frame is abouttostart.

Frameformats.(a)Ethernet(DIX).(b)IEEE802.3. Nextcome twoaddresses, oneforthe destination andoneforthe source. They are each6bytes long. The first transmittedbit ofthe destination address isa0for SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 283 ordinary addresses and a 1 for group addresses. Group addresses allow multiple stations to listen to a single address. When a frame is sent to a group address, all the stations in the groupreceive it. Sending to a group of stations is called multi- casting. The special address consisting of all 1 bits is reserved for broadcasting. A frame containing all 1s in the destination field is accepted by all stations on the network. Multicasting is more selective, but it involves group management to define which stations are in the group. Conversely, broadcasting does not dif- ferentiate between stations atall, soitdoesnotrequire anygroupmanagement. An interesting feature of station source addresses is that they are globally unique, assigned centrally by IEEE to ensure that no two stations anywhere in the world have the same address', 'The idea is that any station can uniquely address any other station by just giving the right 48-bit number. To do this, the first 3 bytesofthe address field are used foranOUI (Organizationally Unique Identif- ier). Values for this field are assigned by IEEE and indicate a manufacturer. Manufacturers are assigned blocks of 224 addresses. The manufacturer assigns the last 3 bytes of the address and programs the complete address into the NIC before itissold. Next comes the Type or Length field, depending on whether the frame is Eth- ernet or IEEE 802.3. Ethernet uses a Type field to tell the receiver what to do with the frame. Multiple network-layer protocols may be in use at the same time onthe same machine, sowhen anEthernet frame arrives, theoperating systemhas to know which one to hand the frame to. The Type field specifies which process togive the frame to. For example, atypecode of0x0800means thatthedata con- tains anIPv4packet. IEEE 802.3, in its wisdom, decided that this field would carry the length of the frame, since the Ethernet length was determined bylookinginside the data—a layering violation if ever there was one. Of course, this meant there was no way for the receiver to figure out what to do with an incoming frame. That problem was handled by the addition of another header for the LLC (Logical Link Con- trol) protocol within the data. It uses 8 bytes to convey the 2 bytes of protocol typeinformation. Unfortunately, by the time 802.3 was published, so much hardware and software for DIX Ethernet was already in use that few manufacturers and users were enthusiastic about repackaging the Type and Length fields. In 1997, IEEE threw in the towel and said that both ways were fine with it. Fortunately, all the Type fields in use before 1997 had values greater than 1500, then well established as the maximum data size. Now the rule is that any number there less than or equal to 0x600 (1536) can be interpreted as Length, and any number greater than 0x600 can be interpreted as Type. Now IEEE can maintain that everyone is using its standard and everybody else can keep on doing what they were already doing (notbothering withLLC) withoutfeeling guiltyaboutit. Next come the data, up to 1500 bytes. This limit was chosen somewhat arbi- trarily at the time the Ethernet standard was cast instone, mostly based onthefact 284 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 that a transceiver needs enough RAM to hold an entire frame and RAM was expensive in1978. Alarger upperlimit wouldhave meant more RAM, andhence amoreexpensive transceiver. In addition to there being a maximum frame length, there is also a minimum frame length. While a data field of 0 bytes is sometimes useful, it causes a prob- lem. When a transceiver detects a collision, it truncates the current frame, which means that stray bits and pieces of frames appear on the cable all the time. To make it easier to distinguish valid frames from garbage, Ethernet requires that valid frames must beat least 64bytes long,fromdestination address tochecksum, including both', 'Ifthedata portion ofaframe isless than 46bytes, the Padfield is usedtofillouttheframe totheminimum size. Another (andmoreimportant) reason forhavingaminimum length frame isto prevent a station from completing the transmission of a short frame before the first bit has even reached the far end of the cable, where it may collide with another frame. This problem is illustrated in Fig.4-15. At time 0, station A, at one end of the network, sends off a frame. Let us call the propagation time for this frame to reach the other end τ. Just before the frame gets to the other end (i.e., at time τ−ε),the most distant station, B,starts transmitting. When Bdetects that it is receiving more power than it is putting out, it knows that a collision has occurred, so it aborts its transmission and generates a 48-bit noise burst to warn all other stations. In other words, it jams the ether to make sure the sender does notmiss the collision. Atabouttime 2τ,the sender sees the noise burstand aborts itstransmission, too. Itthenwaits arandomtimebefore tryingagain. Packetstarts Packetalmost A B A B attime0 atBat (a) (b) Noiseburstgets backtoAat2 A B A B (c) Collisionat (d) time Figure4-15. Collisiondetectioncantakeaslongas2τ. If a station tries to transmit a very short frame, it is conceivable that a colli- sion will occur, but the transmission will have completed before the noise burst gets back to the station at 2τ. The sender will then incorrectly conclude that the frame was successfully sent. To prevent this situation from occurring, all frames must take more than 2τ to send so that the transmission is still taking place when SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 285 the noise burst gets back to the sender. For a 10-Mbps LAN with a maximum length of 2500 meters and four repeaters (from the 802.3 specification), the round-trip time (including time to propagate through the four repeaters) has been determined tobenearly 50μsec intheworst case. Therefore, the shortest allowed frame must take atleast thislongtotransmit. At10Mbps,abittakes 100nsec, so 500 bits is the smallest frame that is guaranteed to work. To add some margin of safety, thisnumber wasroundedupto512bitsor64bytes. The final field is the Checksum. It is a 32-bit CRC of the kind we studied in Sec. 3.2. In fact, it is defined exactly by the generator polynomial we gave there, which popped up for PPP, ADSL, and other links too. This CRC is an error- detecting code that isused todetermine ifthe bitsoftheframe have beenreceived correctly. It just does error detection, with the frame dropped if an error is detected. CSMA/CD withBinary Exponential Backoff Classic Ethernet uses the 1-persistent CSMA/CD algorithm that we studied in Sec. 4.2. This descriptor just means that stations sense the medium when they have a frame to send and send the frame as soon as the medium becomes idle. They monitor the channel for collisions as they send. If there is a collision, they abort the transmission with a short jam signal and retransmit after a random inter- val. Let us now see how the random interval is determined when a collision occurs, as itisanewmethod. Themodel isstillthatofFig.4-5', 'After acollision, time is divided into discrete slots whose length is equal to the worst-case round- trip propagation time onthe ether (2τ). Toaccommodate the longestpath allowed byEthernet, theslottimehasbeen setto512bittimes, or51.2μsec. After the first collision, each station waits either 0 or 1 slot times at random before trying again. If two stations collide and each one picks the same random number, they will collide again. After the second collision, each one picks either 0, 1, 2, or 3 at random and waits that number of slot times. If a third collision occurs (the probability of this happening is 0.25), the next time the number of slotstowait ischosen atrandomfromtheinterval 0to23 −1. Ingeneral, after icollisions,arandomnumber between 0and 2i −1ischosen, and that number of slots is skipped. However, after 10 collisions have been reached, the randomization interval is frozen at a maximum of 1023 slots. After 16 collisions, the controller throws in the towel and reports failure back to the computer. Further recovery isuptohigher layers. This algorithm, called binary exponential backoff, was chosen to dynami- cally adapt to the number of stations trying to send. If the randomization interval forall collisions were 1023, the chance of two stations collidingfor a secondtime would be negligible, but the average wait after a collision would be hundreds of slottimes, introducingsignificant delay. Onthe other hand, ifeach station always 286 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 delayed for either 0 or 1 slots, then if 100 stations ever tried to send at once they would collide over and over until 99 of them picked 1 and the remaining station picked 0. This might take years. By having the randomization interval grow ex- ponentially as more and more consecutive collisions occur, the algorithm ensures a low delay when only a few stations collide but also ensures that the collisions are resolved in a reasonable interval when many stations collide. Truncating the backoff at1023keeps theboundfromgrowingtoolarge. If there is no collision, the sender assumes that the frame was probably suc- cessfully delivered. That is, neither CSMA/CD nor Ethernet provides acknowl- edgements. This choice is appropriate for wired and optical fiber channels that have low error rates. Any errors that do occur must then be detected by the CRC and recovered by higher layers. For wireless channels that have more errors, we willsee thatacknowledgementsare used. 4.3.3 Ethernet Performance Now let us briefly examine the performance of classic Ethernet under condi- tions of heavy and constant load, that is, with k stations always ready to transmit. A rigorous analysis of the binary exponential backoff algorithm is complicated. Instead, we will follow Metcalfe and Boggs (1976) and assume a constant retransmission probability in each slot. If each station transmits during a conten- tion slot with probability p, the probability A that some station acquires the chan- nelinthatslotis A =kp(1−p)k−1 (4-5) A is maximized when p =1/k, with A →1/e as k →∞', 'The probability that the contention interval has exactly j slots in it is A(1−A)j−1, so the mean number of slotspercontention isgivenby Σ ∞ jA(1−A)j−1 = 1 A j=0 Since each slot has a duration 2τ, the mean contention interval, w, is 2τ/A. Assuming optimal p, the mean number of contention slots is never more than e, sowisatmost2τe ∼∼5.4τ. If the mean frame takes P sec to transmit, when many stations have frames to send, P Channel efficiency = (4-6) P +2τ/A Here we see where the maximum cable distance between any two stations enters into the performance figures. The longer the cable, the longer the contention interval, whichiswhytheEthernet standard specifies amaximum cable length. SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 287 It is instructive toformulate Eq. (4-6) interms of the frame length, F, the net- work bandwidth, B, the cable length, L, and the speed of signal propagation, c, for the optimal case of e contention slots per frame. With P =F/B, Eq. (4-6) becomes 1 Channel efficiency = (4-7) 1+2BLe/cF When thesecondterm inthedenominator islarge, network efficiency willbe low. More specifically, increasing network bandwidth or distance (the BL product) reduces efficiency for a given frame size. Unfortunately, much research on net- work hardware is aimed precisely at increasing this product. People want high bandwidth over longdistances (fiber optic MANs, for example), yet classic Ether- net implemented in this manner is not the best system for these applications. We willsee other waysofimplementing Ethernet inthenextsection. In Fig.4-16, the channel efficiency is plotted versus the number of ready sta- tions for 2τ=51.2μsec and a data rate of 10 Mbps, using Eq. (4-7). With a 64- byte slot time, it is not surprising that 64-byte frames are not efficient. On the other hand, with 1024-byte frames and an asymptotic value of e 64-byte slots per contention interval, the contention period is 174 bytes long and the efficiency is 85%.

EfficiencyofEthernetat10Mbpswith512-bitslottimes. Itisprobablyworthmentioning that there has been a large amountoftheoreti- cal performance analysis of Ethernet (and other networks). Most of the results should be taken with a grain (or better yet, a metric ton) of salt, for two reasons. 288 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 First, virtually all of the theoretical work assumes Poisson traffic. As researchers have begun looking at real data, it now appears that network traffic is rarely Pois- son. Instead, it is self-similar or bursty over a range of time scales (Paxson and Floyd, 1995; and Leland et al., 1994). What this means is that averaging over long periods of time does not smooth out the traffic. As well as using question- able models, many of the analyses focus on the ‘‘interesting’’ performance cases of abnormally high load. Boggs et al. (1988)showed byexperimentation that Eth- ernet workswell inreality,even at moderately highload. 4.3.4 Switched Ethernet Ethernet soonbegan toevolve away from the single longcable architecture of classic Ethernet', 'The problems associated with finding breaks or loose connec- tionsdroveittoward adifferent kindofwiring pattern, inwhich eachstation has a dedicated cable running to a central hub. A hub simply connects all the attached wires electrically, as if they were soldered together. This configuration is shown inFig. 4-17(a). Port Port Line Hub Line Switch (a) (b) Figure4-17. (a)Hub.(b)Switch. The wires were telephone company twisted pairs, since most office buildings were already wired this way and normally plenty of spares were available. This reuse was a win, but it did reduce the maximum cable run from the hub to 100 meters (200meters ifhighqualityCategory 5twisted pairswere used). Addingor removing a station is simpler in this configuration, and cable breaks can be de- tected easily. Withtheadvantages ofbeingable touseexisting wiring andease of maintenance, twisted-pair hubsquicklybecamethedominant formofEthernet. However, hubs do not increase capacity because they are logically equivalent to the single long cable of classic Ethernet. As more and more stations are added, each station gets a decreasing share of the fixed capacity. Eventually, the LAN will saturate. One way out is to go to a higher speed, say, from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, or even higher speeds. But with the growth of multimedia and powerful servers, even a1-GbpsEthernet can become saturated. SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 289 Fortunately, there is an another way to deal with increased load: switched Ethernet. The heart of this system is a switch containing a high-speed backplane thatconnectsall ofthe ports, as showninFig. 4-17(b). From the outside, aswitch looks just like a hub. They are both boxes, typically with 4 to 48 ports, each with a standard RJ-45 connector for a twisted-pair cable. Each cable connects the switch or hub to a single computer, as shown in Fig. 4-18. A switch has the same advantages as a hub, too. It is easy to add or remove a new station by plugging or unpluggingawire, andit iseasy tofindmost faults since aflakycable orportwill usually affect just one station. There is still a shared component that can fail—the switch itself—but if all stations lose connectivity the IT folks know what to do to fixtheproblem: replacethe wholeswitch. Switch Hub Switchports Twistedpair Figure4-18. AnEthernetswitch. Inside the switch, however, something very different is happening. Switches only output frames to the ports for which those frames are destined. When a switch portreceivesanEthernet frame fromastation, theswitch checks theEther- net addresses to see which port the frame is destined for. This step requires the switch to be able to work out which ports correspond to which addresses, a pro- cess that we will describe in Sec. 4.8 when we get to the general case of switches connected to other switches. For now, just assume that the switch knows the frame’s destination port. The switch then forwards the frame over its high-speed backplane to the destination port. The backplane typically runs at many Gbps, using a proprietary protocol that does not need to be standardized because it is entirely hiddeninside theswitch. Thedestination portthen transmits the frame on the wire so that it reaches the intended station. None of the other ports even knowstheframe exists', 'What happens if more than one of the stations or ports wants to send a frame at the same time? Again, switches differ from hubs. In a hub, all stations are in the same collision domain. They must use the CSMA/CD algorithm to schedule their transmissions. In a switch, each port is its own independent collision domain. In the common case that the cable is full duplex, both the station and the port can send a frame onthe cable at the same time, without worrying aboutother ports and stations. Collisions are now impossible and CSMA/CD is not needed. However, if the cable is half duplex, the station and the port must contend for transmission withCSMA/CD intheusualway. 290 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 A switch improves performance over a hub in two ways. First, since there are no collisions, the capacity is used more efficiently. Second, and more impor- tantly, with a switch multiple frames can be sent simultaneously (by different sta- tions). These frames will reach the switch ports and travel over the switch’s back- plane to be output on the proper ports. However, since two frames might be sent to the same output port at the same time, the switch must have buffering so that it can temporarily queue aninputframe untilitcan betransmittedto the output port. Overall, these improvements give a large performance win that is not possible with a hub. The total system throughput can often be increased by an order of magnitude, depending onthenumber ofportsandtraffic patterns. The change inthe ports on which frames are output also has security benefits. Most LAN interfaces have a promiscuous mode, inwhich all frames are given to each computer, not just those addressed to it. With a hub, every computer that is attached can see the traffic sent between all of the other computers. Spies and busybodies love this feature. With a switch, traffic is forwarded only to the ports where it is destined. This restriction provides better isolation so that traffic will not easily escape and fall into the wrong hands. However, it is better to encrypt traffic ifsecurity isreally needed. Because the switch just expects standard Ethernet frames on each input port, it is possible to use some of the ports as concentrators. In Fig. 4-18, the port in the upper-right corner is connected not to a single station, but to a 12-port hub instead. As frames arrive at the hub, they contend for the ether in the usual way, including collisions and binary backoff. Successful frames make it through the hub to the switch and are treated there like any other incoming frames. The switch does not know they had to fight their way in. Once in the switch, they are sent to the correct output line over the high-speed backplane. It is also possible that the correct destination was one onthe lines attached to the hub, in which case the frame has already been delivered so the switch just drops it. Hubs are simpler and cheaper than switches, but due to falling switch prices they have become an endangered species', 'Modern networks largely use switched Ethernet. Neverthe- less, legacy hubsstillexist. 4.3.5 Fast Ethernet At the same time that switches were becoming popular, the speed of 10-Mbps Ethernet was coming under pressure. At first, 10 Mbps seemed like heaven, just as cable modems seemed like heaven to the users of telephone modems. But the novelty wore off quickly. As a kind of corollary to Parkinson’s Law (‘‘Work expands to fill the time available for its completion’’), it seemed that data expanded tofillthebandwidth available fortheir transmission. Many installations needed more bandwidth and thus had numerous 10-Mbps LANs connected by a maze of repeaters, hubs, and switches, although to the net- work managers it sometimes felt that they were being held together by bubble SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 291 gum and chicken wire. But even with Ethernet switches, the maximum bandwidth ofasingle computer waslimited bythecable thatconnectedittotheswitch port. It was inthis environment that IEEE reconvened the 802.3 committee in 1992 with instructions to come up with a faster LAN. One proposal was to keep 802.3 exactly as it was, but just make it gofaster. Another proposalwas to redo it total- lyandgive it lotsofnewfeatures, suchasreal-time traffic anddigitizedvoice, but just keep the old name (for marketing reasons). After some wrangling, the com- mittee decided to keep 802.3 the way it was, and just make it go faster. This stra- tegy would get the job done before the technology changed and avoid unforeseen problems with a brand new design. The new design would also be backward- compatible with existing Ethernet LANs. The people behind the losing proposal did what any self-respecting computer-industry people would have done under these circumstances: theystompedoffandformed their owncommitteeand stand- ardized their LANanyway (eventually as802.12). Itfloppedmiserably. The work was done quickly (by standards committees’ norms), and the result, 802.3u, was approved by IEEE in June 1995. Technically, 802.3u is not a new standard, but an addendum to the existing 802.3 standard (to emphasize its back- ward compatibility). This strategy is used a lot. Since practically everyone calls itfastEthernet,rather than802.3u,wewilldothat,too. The basic idea behind fast Ethernet was simple: keep all the old frame for- mats, interfaces, and procedural rules, but reduce the bit time from 100nsec to10 nsec. Technically, it would have been possible to copy 10-Mbps classic Ethernet and still detect collisions on time by just reducing the maximum cable length bya factor of10. However, the advantages of twisted-pair wiring were so overwhelm- ing that fast Ethernet is based entirely on this design. Thus, all fast Ethernet sys- tems use hubs and switches; multidrop cables with vampire taps or BNC connec- torsare notpermitted. Nevertheless, some choices still had to be made, the most important being which wire types to support. One contender was Category 3 twisted pair. The argument for it was that practically every office in the Western world had at least four Category 3 (or better) twisted pairs running from it to a telephone wiring closet within 100 meters. Sometimes two such cables existed', 'Thus, using Category 3 twisted pair would make it possible to wire up desktop computers using fast Ethernet without having to rewire the building, an enormous advantage formanyorganizations. The main disadvantage of a Category 3 twisted pair is its inability to carry 100 Mbps over 100 meters, the maximum computer-to-hub distance specified for 10-Mbps hubs. In contrast, Category 5 twisted pair wiring can handle 100 m easily, and fiber can go much farther. The compromise chosen was to allow all three possibilities, as shown in Fig.4-19, but to pep up the Category 3 solution to giveittheadditionalcarrying capacity needed. The Category 3 UTP scheme, called 100Base-T4, used a signaling speed of 25 MHz, only 25% faster than standard Ethernet’s 20 MHz.

However, to achieve the necessary bit rate, 100Base-T4 requires four twisted pairs. Of the four pairs, one is always to the hub, one is always from the hub, and the other two are switchable to the current transmission direction. To get 100 Mbps out of the three twisted pairs in the transmission direction, a fairly involved scheme is used on each twisted pair. It involves sending ternary digits with three different voltage levels. This scheme is not likely to win any prizes for elegance, and we will skip the details. How- ever, since standard telephone wiring for decades has had four twisted pairs per cable, most offices are able to use the existing wiring plant. Of course, it means giving up your office telephone, but that is surely a small price to pay for faster email. 100Base-T4 fell by the wayside as many office buildings were rewired with Category 5 UTP for 100Base-TX Ethernet, which came to dominate the market. This design is simpler because the wires can handle clock rates of 125 MHz. Only two twisted pairs per station are used, one to the hub and one from it. Nei- ther straight binary coding (i.e., NRZ) nor Manchester coding is used. Instead, the 4B/5B encoding we described inSec 2.5 is used. 4data bits are encoded as 5sig- nal bits and sent at 125 MHz to provide 100 Mbps. This scheme is simple but has sufficient transitions for synchronization and uses the bandwidth of the wire rela- tively well. The 100Base-TX system is full duplex; stations can transmit at 100 Mbps on one twisted pair and receive at 100 Mbps on another twisted pair at the same time. The last option, 100Base-FX, uses two strands of multimode fiber, one for each direction, so it, too, can run full duplex with 100 Mbps in each direction. In thissetup, thedistance between astation andtheswitch canbeupto2km. Fast Ethernet allows interconnection by either hubs or switches', 'To ensure that the CSMA/CD algorithm continues to work, the relationship between the minimum frame size and maximum cable length must be maintained as the net- work speed goes up from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. So, either the minimum frame size of 64 bytes must go up or the maximum cable length of 2500 m must come down, proportionally. The easy choice was for the maximum distance between any two stations to come down by a factor of 10, since a hub with 100-m cables falls within this new maximum already. However, 2-km 100Base-FX cables are SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 293 too long to permit a 100-Mbps hub with the normal Ethernet collision algorithm. These cables must instead be connected to a switch and operate in a full-duplex modesothatthere are nocollisions. Users quickly started todeploy fast Ethernet, butthey were notabouttothrow away 10-Mbps Ethernet cards on older computers. As a consequence, virtually all fast Ethernet switches can handle a mix of 10-Mbps and 100-Mbps stations. To make upgrading easy, the standard itself provides a mechanism called auto- negotiation that lets two stations automatically negotiate the optimum speed (10 or 100 Mbps) and duplexity (half or full). It works well most of the time but is known to lead to duplex mismatch problems when one end of the link autonego- tiates but the other end does not and is set to full-duplex mode (Shalunov and Carlson, 2005). MostEthernet productsusethisfeature toconfigure themselves. 4.3.6 Gigabit Ethernet The ink was barely dry on the fast Ethernet standard when the 802 committee began working on a yet faster Ethernet, quickly dubbed gigabit Ethernet. IEEE ratified themostpopularformas802.3abin1999. Below we willdiscuss some of the key features of gigabit Ethernet. More information is given by Spurgeon (2000). The committee’s goals for gigabit Ethernet were essentially the same as the committee’s goals for fast Ethernet: increase performance tenfold while maintain- ingcompatibilitywith all existing Ethernet standards. In particular, gigabit Ether- net had to offer unacknowledged datagram service with both unicast and broad- cast, use the same 48-bitaddressing scheme already inuse, and maintain the same frame format, including the minimum and maximum frame sizes. The final stan- dardmetallthese goals. Like fast Ethernet, all configurations of gigabit Ethernet use point-to-point links. In the simplest configuration, illustrated in Fig.4-20(a), two computers are directly connectedtoeach other. The more common case, however, uses a switch or a hub connected to multiple computers and possibly additional switches or hubs, as shown in Fig. 4-20(b). In both configurations, each individual Ethernet cable hasexactly twodevices onit,nomore andnofewer. Also like fast Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet supports two different modes of operation: full-duplex mode and half-duplex mode. The ‘‘normal’’ mode is full- duplex mode, which allows traffic in both directions at the same time. This mode is used when there is a central switch connected to computers (or other switches) on the periphery. In this configuration, all lines are buffered so each computer and switch is free to send frames whenever it wants to. The sender does not have tosense the channel tosee ifanybodyelse isusingit becausecontention isimpos- sible', 'On the line between a computer and a switch, the computer is the onlypos- sible sender to the switch, and the transmission will succeed even if the switch is currently sending a frame to the computer (because the line is full duplex). Since 294 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 Switchorhub Ethernet Computer Ethernet (a) (b) Figure4-20. (a)Atwo-stationEthernet.(b)AmultistationEthernet. no contention is possible, the CSMA/CD protocol is not used, so the maximum length of the cable is determined bysignal strength issues rather than byhowlong it takes for a noise burst to propagate back to the sender in the worst case. Switch\\\\%es are free to mix and match speeds. Autonegotiation is supported just asinfastEthernet, onlynowthechoice isamong10,100,and1000Mbps. The other mode of operation, half-duplex, is used when the computers are connected to a hub rather than a switch. A hub does not buffer incoming frames. Instead, it electrically connects all the lines internally, simulating the multidrop cable used in classic Ethernet. In this mode, collisions are possible, so the stan- dard CSMA/CD protocol is required. Because a 64-byte frame (the shortest allowed) can now be transmitted 100 times faster than in classic Ethernet, the maximum cable length must be 100 times less, or 25 meters, to maintain the essential property that the sender is still transmitting when the noise burst gets back to it, even in the worst case. With a 2500-meter-long cable, the sender of a 64-byte frame at 1 Gbps would be long finished before the frame got even a tenth ofthewaytotheother end,letalone totheendandback. This length restriction was painful enough that two features were added to the standard to increase the maximum cable length to 200 meters, which is probably enough for most offices. The first feature, called carrier extension, essentially tells the hardware to add its own padding after the normal frame to extend the frame to 512 bytes. Since this padding is added by the sending hardware and removed bythe receivinghardware, the software isunaware ofit,meaning thatno changes are needed to existing software. The downside is that using 512 bytes worth of bandwidth to transmit 46 bytes of user data (the payload of a 64-byte frame) hasalineefficiency ofonly9%. The second feature, called frame bursting, allows a sender to transmit a con- catenated sequence of multiple frames in a single transmission. If the total burst is less than 512 bytes, the hardware pads it again. If enough frames are waiting fortransmission, thisscheme isveryefficient andpreferred overcarrier extension. SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 295 In all fairness, it is hard to imagine an organization buying modern computers with gigabit Ethernet cards and then connecting them with an old-fashioned hub to simulate classic Ethernet with all its collisions. Gigabit Ethernet interfaces and switches used tobe expensive, buttheir prices fell rapidly assales volumes picked up. Still, backward compatibility is sacred in the computer industry, so the com- mittee was required to put it in. Today, most computers ship with an Ethernet interface that is capable of 10-, 100-, and 1000-Mbps operation and compatible withallofthem. Gigabit Ethernet supportsboth copper and fiber cabling, as listed in Fig.4-21', 'Signaling at or near 1 Gbps requires encoding and sending a bit every nanosecond. This trick was initially accomplished with short, shielded copper cables (the 1000Base-CX version) and optical fibers. For the optical fibers, two wavelengths are permitted and result in two different versions: 0.85 microns (short,for1000Base-SX)and1.3microns (long,for1000Base-LX).

GigabitEthernetcabling. Signaling at the short wavelength can be achieved with cheaper LEDs. It is used with multimode fiber and is useful for connections within a building, as it can run up to 500 m for 50-micron fiber. Signaling at the long wavelength requires more expensive lasers. On the other hand, when combined with single- mode(10-micron) fiber, thecable length can be upto5km.This limit allows long distance connections between buildings, such as for a campus backbone, as a dedicated point-to-point link. Later variations ofthestandard allowed evenlonger linksoversingle-mode fiber. To send bits over these versions of gigabit Ethernet, the 8B/10B encoding we described in Sec. 2.5 was borrowed from another networking technology called Fibre Channel. That scheme encodes 8 bits of data into 10-bit codewords that are sent over the wire or fiber, hence the name 8B/10B. The codewords were chosen so that they could be balanced (i.e., have the same number of 0s and 1s) with suf- ficient transitions for clock recovery. Sending the coded bits with NRZ requires a signaling bandwidth of 25% more than that required for the uncoded bits, a big improvement overthe100%expansion ofManchester coding. However, all of these options required new copper or fiber cables to support the faster signaling. None of them made use of the large amount of Category 5 UTP that had been installed along with fast Ethernet. Within a year, 1000Base-T 296 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 came alongtofillthis gap, andit has been the mostpopularform ofgigabit Ether- netever since. People apparently dislike rewiring their buildings. More complicated signaling is needed to make Ethernet run at 1000 Mbps over Category 5 wires. To start, all four twisted pairs in the cable are used, and each pair is used in both directions at the same time by using digital signal pro- cessing to separate signals. Over each wire, five voltage levels that carry 2 bits are used for signaling at 125 Msymbols/sec. The mapping to produce the symbols from the bits is not straightforward. It involves scrambling, for transitions, fol- lowed by an error correcting code in which four values are embedded into five signal levels. A speed of 1 Gbps is quite fast. For example, if a receiver is busy with some other task foreven 1msec and does notempty the inputbuffer onsome line, upto 1953 frames may have accumulated in that gap. Also, when a computer on a gigabit Ethernet is shipping data down the line to a computer on a classic Ether- net, buffer overruns are very likely. As a consequence of these two observations, gigabit Ethernet supports flow control', 'The mechanism consists of one end send- ing a special control frame to the other end telling it to pause for some period of time. These PAUSE control frames are normal Ethernet frames containing a type of 0x8808. Pauses are given in units of the minimum frame time. For gigabit Ethernet, thetime unitis512nsec, allowing forpauses aslongas33.6msec. There is one more extension that was introduced along with gigabit Ethernet. Jumbo frames allow for frames tobe longerthan 1500bytes, usually upto9KB. This extension is proprietary. It is not recognized by the standard because if it is used then Ethernet is nolonger compatible withearlier versions, butmostvendors support it anyway. The rationale is that 1500 bytes is a short unit at gigabit speeds. By manipulating larger blocks of information, the frame rate can be decreased, along with the processing associated with it, such as interrupting the processor to say that a frame has arrived, or splitting up and recombining mes- sages thatwere toolongtofitinoneEthernet frame. 4.3.7 10-Gigabit Ethernet As soon as gigabit Ethernet was standardized, the 802 committee got bored and wanted to get back to work. IEEE told them to start on 10-gigabit Ethernet. This work followed much the same pattern as the previous Ethernet standards, with standards for fiber and shielded copper cable appearing first in 2002 and 2004,followed bythestandard forcoppertwisted pair in2006. 10 Gbps is a truly prodigious speed, 1000x faster than the original Ethernet. Where could it be needed? The answer is inside data centers and exchanges to connect high-end routers, switches, and servers, as well as in long-distance, high bandwidth trunks between offices that are enabling entire metropolitan area net- works based on Ethernet and fiber. The long distance connections use optical fiber, while theshortconnectionsmayusecopperorfiber. SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 297 All versions of 10-gigabit Ethernet support only full-duplex operation. CSMA/CD is no longer part of the design, and the standards concentrate on the details of physical layers that can run at very high speed. Compatibility still matters, though, so 10-gigabit Ethernet interfaces autonegotiate and fall back to thehighest speed supportedbybothendsoftheline. The main kinds of 10-gigabit Ethernet are listed in Fig.4-22. Multimode fiber with the 0.85μ (short) wavelength is used for medium distances, and single- mode fiber at 1.3μ (long) and 1.5μ (extended) is used for long distances. 10GBase-ER can run for distances of 40 km, making it suitable for wide area applications. All of these versions send a serial stream of information that is pro- duced by scrambling the data bits, then encoding them with a 64B/66B code. This encoding haslessoverhead thanan8B/10Bcode.

The first copper version defined, 10GBase-CX4, uses a cable with four pairs of twinaxial copper wiring. Each pair uses 8B/10B coding and runs at 3.125 Gsymbols/second to reach 10 Gbps', 'This version is cheaper than fiber and was early to market, but it remains to be seen whether it will be beat out in the long runby10-gigabit Ethernet overmoregarden variety twisted pairwiring. 10GBase-T is the version that uses UTP cables. While it calls for Category 6a wiring, for shorter runs, it can use lower categories (including Category 5) to allow some reuse of installed cabling. Not surprisingly, the physical layer is quite involved to reach 10 Gbps over twisted pair. We will only sketch some of the high-level details. Each of the four twisted pairs is used to send 2500 Mbps in both directions. This speed isreachedusingasignaling rate of800Msymbols/sec with symbols that use 16 voltage levels. The symbols are produced by scrambling the data, protecting it with a LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) code, and further codingforerrorcorrection. 10-gigabit Ethernet is still shaking out in the market, but the 802.3 committee has already moved on. At the end of 2007, IEEE created a group to standardize Ethernet operating at 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps. This upgrade will let Ethernet com- pete in very high-performance settings, including long-distance connections in backbone networks and short connections over the equipment backplanes. The standard isnotyetcomplete, butproprietary productsare already available. 298 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 4.3.8 Retrospective on Ethernet Ethernet has been around for over 30 years and has no serious competitors in sight, so it is likely to be around for many years tocome. Few CPU architectures, operating systems, or programming languages have been king of the mountain for three decadesgoingonstrong. Clearly, Ethernet didsomething right. What? Probably the main reason for its longevity is that Ethernet is simple and flexi- ble. Inpractice, simple translates intoreliable, cheap, andeasy tomaintain. Once the hub and switch architecture was adopted, failures became extremely rare. People hesitate to replace something that works perfectly all the time, especially when they know that an awful lot of things in the computer industry work very poorly,sothatmanyso-called ‘‘upgrades’’are worse thanwhat theyreplaced. Simple also translates into cheap. Twisted-pair wiring is relatively inexpen- sive as are the hardware components. They may start out expensive when there is a transition, for example, new gigabit Ethernet NICs or switches, but they are merely additions to a well established network (not a replacement of it) and the prices fall quicklyasthesales volumepicksup. Ethernet is easy to maintain. There is no software to install (other than the drivers) and not much in the way of configuration tables to manage (and get wrong). Also,addingnewhostsisassimple asjustpluggingthemin. Another point is that Ethernet interworks easily with TCP/IP, which has become dominant. IP is a connectionless protocol, so it fits perfectly with Ether- net, which is also connectionless. IP fits much less well with connection-oriented alternatives suchasATM. Thismismatch definitely hurtATM’schances. Lastly, andperhaps most importantly, Ethernet has been able to evolve in cer- tain crucial ways. Speeds have gone up by several orders of magnitude and hubs and switches have been introduced, but these changes have not required changing the software and have often allowed the existing cabling to be reused for a time', 'When a network salesman shows up at a large installation and says ‘‘I have this fantastic new network for you. All you have to do is throw out all your hardware andrewrite allyoursoftware,’’hehasaproblem. Many alternative technologies that you have probably not even heard of were faster than Ethernet when they were introduced. As well as ATM, this list † includes FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) and Fibre Channel, two ring- based optical LANs. Both were incompatible with Ethernet. Neither one made it. They were too complicated, which led to complex chips and high prices. The les- sonthat shouldhave been learned here was KISS (Keep ItSimple, Stupid). Even- tually, Ethernet caught up with them in terms of speed, often by borrowing some of their technology, for example, the 4B/5B coding from FDDI and the 8B/10B codingfromFibre Channel. Then they hadnoadvantages left and quietly died off orfell intospecialized roles. †Itiscalled‘‘FibreChannel’’andnot‘‘FiberChannel’’becausethedocumenteditorwasBritish. SEC. 4.3 ETHERNET 299 It looks like Ethernet will continue to expand in its applications for some time. 10-gigabit Ethernet has freed it from the distance constraints of CSMA/CD. Much effort is being put into carrier-grade Ethernet to let network providers offer Ethernet-based services to their customers for metropolitan and wide area networks (Fouli and Maler, 2009). This application carries Ethernet frames long distances over fiber and calls for better management features to help operators offer reliable, high-quality services. Very high speed networks are also finding uses in backplanes connecting components in large routers or servers. Both of these usesare inadditiontothatofsendingframes between computers inoffices. 4.4 WIRELESS LANS Wireless LANs are increasingly popular, and homes, offices, cafes, libraries, airports, zoos, and other public places are being outfitted with them to connect computers, PDAs, and smart phones to the Internet. Wireless LANs can also be used to let two or more nearby computers communicate without using the Inter- net. The main wireless LAN standard is802.11. We gave some background infor- mation on it in Sec. 1.5.3. Now it is time to take a closer look at the technology. In the following sections, we will look at the protocol stack, physical-layer radio transmission techniques, the MAC sublayer protocol, the frame structure, and the services provided. For more information about 802.11, see Gast (2005). To get the truth from the mouth of the horse, consult the published standard, IEEE 802.11-2007itself. 4.4.1 The 802.11Architecture and Protocol Stack 802.11 networks can be used in two modes. The most popular mode is to con- nect clients, such as laptops and smart phones,to another network, such as acom- panyintranet orthe Internet. Thismode isshowninFig. 4-23(a). Ininfrastructure mode, each client is associated with an AP (Access Point) that is in turn con- nected to the other network. The client sends and receives its packets via the AP. Several access points may be connected together, typically by a wired network called a distribution system, to form an extended 802.11 network. In this case, clients can sendframes tootherclients viatheir APs. The othermode,showninFig. 4-23(b),isanad hoc network. Thismode isa collection ofcomputers that are associated sothat they can directly sendframes to eachother. There isnoaccesspoint', 'Since Internet accessis the killer application forwireless, adhocnetworks are notverypopular. Now we will look at the protocols. All the 802 protocols, including 802.11 and Ethernet, have a certain commonality of structure. A partial view of the 802.11 protocol stack is given in Fig.4-24. The stack is the same for clients and 300 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 Access Tonetwork point Client (a) (b) Figure4-23. 802.11architecture. (a)Infrastructure mode.(b)Ad-hocmode. APs. The physical layer corresponds fairly well to the OSI physical layer, but the data link layer in all the 802 protocols is split into two or more sublayers. In 802.11, the MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer determines how the channel is allocated, that is, who gets to transmit next. Above it is the LLC (Logical Link Control) sublayer, whose jobitistohide the differences between the different 802 variants and make them indistinguishableas far as the network layer isconcerned. This could have been a significant responsibility, butthese days the LLC is a glue layer thatidentifies theprotocol (e.g., IP)thatiscarried within an802.11frame.

Partofthe802.11protocolstack. Several transmission techniques have been added to the physical layer as 802.11 has evolved since it first appeared in 1997. Two of the initial techniques, infrared in the manner of television remote controls and frequency hopping in the 2.4-GHz band, are now defunct. The third initial technique, direct sequence spread spectrum at 1or 2 Mbps in the 2.4-GHz band, was extended to run at rates upto11Mbpsandquicklybecameahit. Itisnowknownas802.11b. SEC. 4.4 WIRELESSLANS 301 To give wireless junkies a much-wanted speed boost, new transmission tech- niques based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) scheme we described in Sec. 2.5.3 were introduced in 1999 and 2003. The first is called 802.11aanduses a different frequency band, 5GHz. The secondstuckwith 2.4GHzandcompatibility.Itiscalled 802.11g. Bothgiverates upto54Mbps. Most recently, transmission techniques that simultaneously use multiple an- tennas at the transmitter and receiver for a speed boost were finalized as 802.11n in Oct. 2009. With four antennas and wider channels, the 802.11 standard now defines rates uptoastartling600Mbps. We will now examine each of these transmission techniques briefly. We will only cover those that are inuse, however, skippingthe legacy 802.11transmission methods. Technically, these belong to the physical layer and should have been examined inChap. 2,butsince they are soclosely tied toLANs ingeneral and the 802.11LANinparticular, wetreat themhere instead. 4.4.2 The 802.11Physical Layer Each of the transmission techniques makes it possible to send a MAC frame over the air from one station to another. They differ, however, in the technology used and speeds achievable. A detailed discussion of these technologies is far beyond the scope of this book, but a few words oneach one will relate the techni- ques to the material we covered in Sec. 2.5 and will provide interested readers withthekeyterms tosearch forelsewhere formore information. All of the 802.11 techniques use short-range radios to transmit signals in ei- ther the 2.4-GHz orthe 5-GHz ISMfrequency bands, bothdescribed inSec. 2.3.3', 'These bands have the advantage of being unlicensed and hence freely available to any transmitter willing to meet some restrictions, such as radiated power of at most1W (though 50mW is more typical for wireless LAN radios). Unfortunate- ly, this fact is also known to the manufacturers of garage door openers, cordless phones, microwave ovens, and countless other devices, all of which compete with laptops for the same spectrum. The 2.4-GHz band tends to be more crowded than the 5-GHz band, so 5 GHz can be better for some applications even though it has shorter range duetothehigher frequency. All of the transmission methods also define multiple rates. The idea is that different rates can be used depending on the current conditions. If the wireless signal isweak, alowrate can beused. Ifthe signal isclear, the highest rate can be used. This adjustment is called rate adaptation. Since the rates vary by a factor of 10or more, goodrate adaptation is important for goodperformance. Of course, since it is not needed for interoperability, the standards do not say how rate adap- tation shouldbedone. The first transmission methodwe shall lookat is 802.11b. It is a spread-spec- trum method that supports rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps, though in practice the operating rate is nearly always 11 Mbps. It is similar to the CDMA system we 302 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 examined in Sec. 2.5, except that there is only one spreading code that is shared by all users. Spreading is used to satisfy the FCC requirement that power be spread over the ISM band. The spreading sequence used by 201.11b is a Barker sequence. It has the property that its autocorrelation is low except when the se- quences are aligned. This property allows a receiver to lock onto the start of a transmission. To send at a rate of 1 Mbps, the Barker sequence is used with BPSK modulationtosend 1bitper11chips. Thechipsare transmittedatarate of 11 Mchips/sec. To send at 2 Mbps, it is used with QPSK modulation to send 2 bits per 11chips. The higher rates are different. These rates use a technique call- ed CCK (Complementary Code Keying) to construct codes instead of the Barker sequence. The 5.5-Mbps rate sends 4 bits in every 8-chip code, and the 11-Mbpsrate sends8bitsinevery 8-chipcode. Next we come to 802.11a, which supports rates up to 54 Mbps in the 5-GHz ISM band. You might have expected that 802.11a to come before 802.11b, but that was not the case. Although the 802.11a group was set up first, the 802.11b standard was approved first and its product got to market well ahead of the 802.11aproducts,partly becauseofthedifficulty ofoperating inthe higher 5-GHz band. The 802.11a method is based on OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) because OFDM uses the spectrum efficiently and resists wireless signal degradations such as multipath. Bits are sent over 52 subcarriers in paral- lel, 48 carrying data and 4 used for synchronization. Each symbol lasts 4μs and sends 1, 2, 4, or 6 bits', 'The bits are coded for error correction with a binary con- volutional code first, so only 1/2, 2/3, or 3/4 of the bits are not redundant. With different combinations, 802.11a can run at eight different rates, ranging from 6 to 54 Mbps. These rates are significantly faster than 802.11b rates, and there is less interference inthe 5-GHz band. However, 802.11b has a range that is about seven times greater thanthatof802.11a,whichismoreimportant inmanysituations. Even with the greater range, the 802.11b people had no intention of letting this upstart win the speed championship. Fortunately, in May 2002, the FCC dropped its long-standing rule requiring all wireless communications equipment operating in the ISM bands in the U.S. to use spread spectrum, so it got to work on 802.11g, which was approved by IEEE in 2003. It copies the OFDM modula- tion methods of 802.11abut operates inthe narrow 2.4-GHz ISM band along with 802.11b. Itoffers the same rates as 802.11a(6to54Mbps) plusofcourse compa- tibility with any 802.11b devices that happen to be nearby. All of these different choices can be confusing for customers, so it is common for products to support 802.11a/b/ginasingle NIC. Not content tostop there, the IEEE committee began work on a high-through- put physical layer called 802.11n. It was ratified in 2009. The goal for 802.11n was throughput of at least 100 Mbps after all the wireless overheads were re- moved. This goal called for a raw speed increase of at least a factor of four. To make ithappen, thecommitteedoubledthechannels from20MHz to40MHz and SEC. 4.4 WIRELESSLANS 303 reduced framing overheads by allowing a group of frames to be sent together. More significantly, however, 802.11n uses up to four antennas to transmit up to four streams of information at the same time. The signals of the streams interfere at the receiver,butthey can be separated using MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) communications techniques. The use of multiple antennas gives a large speed boost, or better range and reliability instead. MIMO, like OFDM, is one of those clever communications ideas that is changing wireless designs and which we are all likely tohear a lotaboutinthe future. For a brief introductionto multi- pleantennas in802.11see Halperin etal.(2010). 4.4.3 The 802.11MAC SublayerProtocol Let us now return from the land of electrical engineering to the land of com- puter science. The 802.11 MAC sublayer protocol is quite different from that of Ethernet, duetotwofactors thatare fundamentaltowireless communication. First, radios are nearly always half duplex, meaning that they cannot transmit and listen for noise bursts at the same time on a single frequency. The received signal can easily be a million times weaker than the transmitted signal, so it can- not be heard at the same time. With Ethernet, a station just waits until the ether goes silent and then starts transmitting. If it does not receive a noise burst back while transmitting the first 64 bytes, the frame has almost assuredly been deliv- ered correctly. Withwireless, thiscollisiondetection mechanism doesnotwork. Instead, 802.11 tries to avoid collisions with a protocol called CSMA/CA (CSMA with Collision Avoidance)', 'This protocol is conceptually similar to Ethernet’s CSMA/CD, with channel sensing before sending and exponential back off after collisions. However, a station that has a frame to send starts with a ran- dom backoff (except in the case that it has not used the channel recently and the channel is idle). It does not wait for a collision. The number of slots tobackoff is chosen inthe range 0to,say, 15inthe case ofthe OFDM physicallayer. The sta- tion waits until the channel is idle, by sensing that there is no signal for a short period oftime (called the DIFS, as we explain below), and countsdown idle slots, pausing when frames are sent. It sends its frame when the counter reaches 0. If the frame gets through, the destination immediately sends a short acknowledge- ment. Lack ofanacknowledgementisinferred toindicate anerror, whether acol- lision or otherwise. In this case, the sender doubles the backoff period and tries again, continuing with exponential backoff as in Ethernet until the frame has been successfully transmitted or the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached. An example timeline is shown in Fig. 4-25. Station A is the first to send a frame. While A is sending, stations B and C become ready to send. They see that the channel is busy and wait for it to become idle. Shortly after A receives an ac- knowledgement, the channel goes idle. However, rather than sending a frame rightaway andcolliding,BandCbothperform abackoff. Cpicks ashortbackoff, 304 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 and thus sends first. B pauses its countdown while it senses that C is using the channel, and resumes after C has received an acknowledgement. B soon com- pletes itsbackoff andsendsitsframe.

SendingaframewithCSMA/CA. Compared toEthernet, there are twomain differences. First, starting backoffs early helps to avoid collisions. This avoidance is worthwhile because collisions are expensive, as the entire frame is transmitted even if one occurs. Second, ac- knowledgementsare usedtoinfer collisionsbecausecollisionscannotbedetected. This mode of operation is called DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) because each station acts independently, without any kind of central control. The standard also includes an optional mode of operation called PCF (Point Coordi- nation Function) in which the access point controls all activity in its cell, just like a cellular base station. However, PCF is not used in practice because there is normally no way to prevent stations in another nearby network from transmitting competing traffic. The second problem is that the transmission ranges of different stations may be different. With a wire, the system is engineered so that all stations can hear each other. With the complexities of RF propagation this situation does not hold for wireless stations. Consequently, situations such as the hidden terminal prob- lem mentioned earlier and illustrated again in Fig. 4-26(a) can arise. Since not all stations are within radio range ofeach other, transmissions goingoninone part of a cell may not be received elsewhere in the same cell', \"In this example, station C is transmitting to station B. If A senses the channel, it will not hear anything and will falsely conclude that it may now start transmitting to B. This decision leads toacollision. The inverse situation is the exposed terminal problem, illustrated in Fig.4- 26(b). Here, B wants to send to C, so it listens to the channel. When it hears a SEC. 4.4 WIRELESSLANS 305 AwantstosendtoB BwantstosendtoC butcannothearthat butmistakenlythinks Bisbusy thetransmissionwillfail Range Range ofC's ofA's radio radio A B C A B C Cis Ais transmitting transmitting (a) (b) Figure4-26. (a)Thehiddenterminalproblem.(b)Theexposedterminalproblem. transmission, it falsely concludes that it may not send to C, even though A may in fact be transmitting to D (not shown). This decision wastes a transmission oppor- tunity. To reduce ambiguities about which station is sending, 802.11 defines channel sensing to consist of both physical sensing and virtual sensing. Physical sensing simply checks the medium to see if there is a valid signal. With virtual sensing, each station keeps a logical record of when the channel is in use by tracking the NAV (Network Allocation Vector). Each frame carries a NAV field that says how long the sequence of which this frame is part will take to complete. Stations that overhear this frame know that the channel will be busy for the period indi- cated bytheNAV, regardless of whether they can sense a physical signal. For ex- ample, theNAVofadata frame includes thetimeneeded tosend anacknowledge- ment. All stations that hear the data frame will defer during the acknowledgement period, whether ornottheycan hear theacknowledgement. An optional RTS/CTS mechanism uses the NAV to prevent terminals from sending frames at the same time as hidden terminals. It is shown in Fig. 4-27. In this example, A wants to send to B. C is a station within range of A (and possibly within range of B, but that does not matter). D is a station within range of B but notwithin range ofA. The protocol starts when A decides it wants to send data to B. A begins by sending anRTS frame to B to request permission to send it a frame. If B receives this request, it answers with a CTS frame to indicate that the channel is clear to send. Upon receipt of the CTS, A sends its frame and starts an ACK timer. Upon correct receipt of the data frame, B responds with an ACK frame, completing the exchange. If A’sACK timer expires before theACK gets back toit, it is treated as acollisionandthewholeprotocol isrunagain after abackoff. 306 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 RTS Data A CTS ACK B NAV C NAV D Time Figure4-27.

If it does, it realizes that someone is going to send data soon. From the information provided in the RTS request, it can estimate howlongthesequence willtake, including thefinalACK. So,forthe good of all, it desists from transmitting anything until the exchange is completed. Itdoes sobyupdatingitsrecord oftheNAVtoindicate thatthechannel isbusy,as shown in Fig. 4-27\", 'D does not hear the RTS, but it does hear the CTS, so it also updates its NAV. Note that the NAV signals are not transmitted; they are just in- ternal reminders tokeep quietforacertain periodoftime. However, whileRTS/CTS soundsgoodintheory, it isoneofthose designs that has proved to be of little value in practice. Several reasons why it is seldom used are known. It does not help for short frames (which are sent in place of the RTS) or for the AP (which everyone can hear, by definition). For other situations, it only slows down operation. RTS/CTS in 802.11 is a little different than in the MACA protocol we saw in Sec 4.2 because everyone hearing the RTS or CTS remains quiet for the duration to allow the ACK to get through without collision. Because of this, it does not help with exposed terminals as MACA did, only with hidden terminals. Most often there are few hidden terminals, and CSMA/CA al- ready helps them by slowing down stations that transmit unsuccessfully,whatever thecause, tomake itmorelikely thattransmissions willsucceed. CSMA/CA with physical and virtual sensing is the core of the 802.11 proto- col. However, there are several other mechanisms that have been developed to go with it. Each of these mechanisms was driven by the needs of real operation, so wewilllookatthembriefly. The first need we will look at is reliability. In contrast to wired networks, wireless networks are noisy and unreliable, in no small part due to interference from other kinds of devices, such as microwave ovens, which also use the unli- censed ISM bands. The use of acknowledgements and retransmissions is of little helpiftheprobabilityofgettingaframe throughissmall inthefirstplace. SEC. 4.4 WIRELESSLANS 307 The main strategy that is used to increase successful transmissions is to lower the transmission rate. Slower rates use more robust modulations that are more likely to be received correctly for a given signal-to-noise ratio. If too many frames are lost, a station can lower the rate. If frames are delivered with little loss,astation can occasionallytest ahigherrate tosee ifitshouldbeused. Another strategy to improve the chance of the frame getting through undam- aged is to send shorter frames. If the probability of any bit being in error is p, the probability of an n-bit frame being received entirely correctly is (1−p)n. For ex- ample, for p =10 −4, the probability of receiving a full Ethernet frame (12,144 bits) correctly is less than 30%. Most frames will be lost. But if the frames are only a third as long(4048 bits) two thirds of them will bereceivedcorrectly. Now mostframes willgetthroughandfewer retransmissions willbeneeded. Shorter frames can be implemented by reducing the maximum size of the message that is accepted from the network layer. Alternatively, 802.11 allows frames to be split into smaller pieces, called fragments, each with its own check- sum. The fragment size isnotfixedbythestandard, butisaparameter thatcan be adjusted by the AP. The fragments are individually numbered and acknowledged using a stop-and-wait protocol (i.e., the sender may not transmit fragment k +1 until it has received the acknowledgement for fragment k)', 'Once the channel has been acquired, multiple fragments are sent as a burst. They go one after the other with an acknowledgement (and possibly retransmissions) in between, until either the whole frame has been successfully sent or the transmission time reaches the maximum allowed. The NAV mechanism keeps other stations quiet only until the next acknowledgement, but another mechanism (see below) is used to allow a burstoffragments tobesentwithoutotherstations sending aframe inthemiddle. The second need we will discuss is saving power. Battery life is always an issue with mobile wireless devices. The 802.11 standard pays attention to the issue of power management so that clients need not waste power when they have neither information tosendnortoreceive. The basic mechanism for saving power builds on beacon frames. Beacons are periodic broadcasts by the AP (e.g., every 100 msec). The frames advertise the presence of the AP to clients and carry system parameters, such as the identi- fier oftheAP,thetime, howlonguntilthenextbeacon,andsecurity settings. Clients can set a power-management bit in frames that they send to the AP to tell it that they are entering power-save mode. In this mode, the client can doze and the AP will buffer traffic intended for it. To check for incoming traffic, the client wakes up for every beacon, and checks a traffic map that is sent as part of the beacon. This map tells the client if there is buffered traffic. If so, the client sends a poll message to the AP, which then sends the buffered traffic. The client can thengoback tosleep untilthenextbeaconissent. Another power-saving mechanism, called APSD (Automatic Power Save Delivery), was also added to 802.11 in 2005. With this new mechanism, the AP buffers frames and sends them to a client just after the client sends frames to the 308 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 AP. The client can then go to sleep until it has more traffic to send (and receive). This mechanism works well for applications such as VoIP that have frequent traf- fic in both directions. For example, a VoIP wireless phone might use it to send and receive frames every 20msec, much more frequently than the beacon interval of100msec, while dozinginbetween. The third and last need we will examine is qualityof service. When the VoIP traffic in the preceding example competes with peer-to-peer traffic, the VoIP traf- fic will suffer. It will be delayed due to contention with the high-bandwidth peer-to-peer traffic, even though the VoIP bandwidth is low. These delays are likely todegrade the voice calls. Toprevent thisdegradation, we wouldlike tolet theVoIP traffic goahead ofthepeer-to-peer traffic, asitisofhigherpriority. IEEE802.11has a clever mechanism toprovide this kindof qualityof service that was introducedas set ofextensions underthename 802.11ein2005. Itworks byextending CSMA/CA with carefully defined intervals between frames. After a frame has been sent, a certain amount of idle time is required before any station may send a frame to check that the channel is no longer in use. The trick is to define different time intervals fordifferent kindsofframes. Five intervals are depicted in Fig.4-28. The interval between regular data frames is called the DIFS (DCF InterFrame Spacing)', 'Any station may attempt to acquire the channel to send a new frame after the medium has been idle for DIFS. The usual contention rules apply, and binary exponential backoff may be needed if a collision occurs. The shortest interval is SIFS (Short InterFrame Spacing). It is used to allow the parties in a single dialog the chance to go first. Examples include letting the receiver send anACK,other control frame sequences like RTS and CTS, or letting a sender transmit a burst of fragments. Sending the next fragment after waitingonlySIFS iswhat prevents another station from jump- inginwithaframe inthemiddle oftheexchange. Controlframeornextfragmentmaybesenthere SIFS High-priorityframehere AIFS 1 RegularDCFframehere DIFS Low-priorityframehere AIFS 4 Badframerecoverydone EIFS ACK Time Figure4-28. Interframespacingin802.11. The two AIFS (Arbitration InterFrame Space) intervals show examples of two different priority levels. The short interval, AIFS , is smaller than DIFS but 1 longer than SIFS. It can be used by the AP to move voice or other high-priority SEC. 4.4 WIRELESSLANS 309 traffic to the head of the line. The AP will wait for a shorter interval before it sends the voice traffic, and thus send it before regular traffic. The long interval, AIFS , is larger than DIFS. It is used for background traffic that can be deferred 4 until after regular traffic. The AP will wait for a longer interval before it sends this traffic, giving regular traffic the opportunity to transmit first. The complete quality of service mechanism defines four different priority levels that have dif- ferent backoff parameters aswell asdifferent idleparameters. The last time interval, EIFS (Extended InterFrame Spacing), is used only by a station that has just received a bad or unknown frame, to report the problem. The idea is that since the receiver may have no idea of what is going on, it should wait awhile toavoidinterfering withanongoingdialogbetween twostations. A further part of the quality of service extensions is the notion of a TXOP or transmission opportunity. The original CSMA/CA mechanism let stations send oneframe at a time. This design was fine until the range of rates increased. With 802.11a/g, one station might be sending at 6 Mbps and another station be sending at 54 Mbps. They each get to send one frame, but the 6-Mbps station takes nine times as long (ignoring fixed overheads) as the 54-Mbps station to send its frame. This disparity has the unfortunate side effect ofslowing downafast sender whois competing with a slow sender toroughlythe rate ofthe slow sender. For example, again ignoring fixed overheads, when sending alone the 6-Mbps and 54-Mbps senders will get their own rates, but when sending together they will both get 5.4 Mbps on average. It is a stiff penalty for the fast sender. This issue is known as therate anomaly(Heusse etal., 2003). With transmission opportunities, each station gets an equal amount of airtime, not an equal number of frames. Stations that send at a higher rate for their airtime willgethigher throughput.Inourexample, whensendingtogether the6-Mbpsand 54-Mbpssenders willnowget3Mbpsand27Mbps,respectively. 4.4.4 The 802.11Frame Structure The 802.11 standard defines three different classes of frames in the air: data, control, and management', 'Each ofthese has a header with avariety offields used within the MAC sublayer. In addition, there are some headers used by the physi- cal layer, but these mostly deal with the modulation techniques used, so we will notdiscuss themhere. We will look at the format of the data frame as an example. It is shown in Fig.4-29. First comes the Frame control field, which is made up of 11 subfields. The first of these is the Protocol version, set to 00. It is there to allow future ver- sions of 802.11 to operate at the same time in the same cell. Then come the Type (data, control, or management) and Subtype fields (e.g., RTS orCTS). For a regu- lar data frame (without quality of service), they are set to 10 and 0000 in binary. The To DS and From DS bits are set to indicate whether the frame is going to or coming from the network connected to the APs, which is called the distribution 310 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 system. The More fragments bit means that more fragments will follow. The Retry bit marks a retransmission of a frame sent earlier. The Power management bit indicates that the sender isgoinginto power-save mode. The More databitin- dicates that the sender has additional frames for the receiver. The Protected Frame bit indicates that the frame body has been encrypted for security. We will discuss security briefly inthe next section. Finally, theOrderbittells thereceiver thatthehigher layer expects thesequence offrames toarrive strictly inorder.

The second field of the data frame, the Duration field, tells how long the frame and its acknowledgement will occupy the channel, measured in microsec- onds. It is present in all types of frames, including control frames, and is what stations usetomanage theNAVmechanism. Next come addresses. Data frames sent to or from an AP have three ad- dresses, all instandard IEEE 802format. The first address isthe receiver,and the second address is the transmitter. They are obviously needed, but what is the third address for? Remember that the AP is simply a relay point for frames as they travel between a client and another point on the network, perhaps a distant client oraportal totheInternet. The thirdaddress gives thisdistant endpoint. The Sequence field numbers frames sothat duplicates can be detected. Of the 16 bits available, 4 identify the fragment and 12 carry a number that is advanced with each new transmission. The Data field contains the payload, up to 2312 bytes. The first bytes of this payload are in a format known as LLC (Logical Link Control). This layer is the glue that identifies the higher-layer protocol (e.g., IP) to which the payloads should be passed. Last comes the Frame check sequence,which isthesame 32-bitCRCwesawinSec. 3.2.2andelsewhere', 'Management frames have the same format as data frames, plus a format for the data portion that varies with the subtype (e.g., parameters in beacon frames). Control frames are short. Like all frames, they have the Frame control, Duration, and Frame check sequence fields. However, they may have only one address and no data portion. Most of the key information is conveyed with the Subtype field (e.g.,ACK,RTSandCTS). SEC. 4.4 WIRELESSLANS 311 4.4.5 Services The 802.11 standard defines the services that the clients, the access points, andthe network connectingthem mustbeaconformant wireless LAN. These ser- vices cluster intoseveral groups. The association service is used by mobile stations to connect themselves to APs. Typically, it is used just after a station moves within radio range of the AP. Upon arrival, the station learns the identity and capabilities of the AP, either from beaconframes orbydirectly asking the AP. The capabilitiesinclude the data rates supported, security arrangements, power-saving capabilities, quality of service support, and more. The station sends a request to associate with the AP. The AP mayacceptorreject therequest. Reassociation lets a station change its preferred AP. This facility is useful for mobile stations moving from one AP to another AP in the same extended 802.11 LAN, like a handover in the cellular network. If it is used correctly, no data will be lost as a consequence of the handover. (But 802.11, like Ethernet, is just a best-effort service.) Either the station or the AP may also disassociate, breaking their relationship. Astation shoulduse thisservice before shuttingdown orleaving thenetwork. TheAPmayuseitbefore goingdownformaintenance. Stations must also authenticate before they can send frames via the AP, but authentication is handled in different ways depending on the choice of security scheme. Ifthe 802.11network is‘‘open,’’anyoneisallowed touse it. Otherwise, credentials are needed to authenticate. The recommended scheme, called WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2), implements security as defined in the 802.11i stan- dard. (Plain WPA is an interim scheme that implements a subset of 802.11i. We willskipit andgostraight tothe complete scheme.) With WPA2, the AP can talk to an authentication server that has a username and password database to deter- mine if the station is allowed to access the network. Alternatively a pre-shared key, which is a fancy name for a network password, may be configured. Several frames are exchanged between the station and the AP with a challenge and re- sponse that lets the station prove it has the right credentials. This exchange hap- pensafter association. The scheme that was used before WPA is called WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). For this scheme, authentication with a preshared key happens before association. However, its use is discouraged because of design flaws that make WEP easy to compromise. The first practical demonstration that WEP was bro- kencame whenAdamStubblefieldwas asummer intern at AT&T (Stubblefieldet al., 2002). He was able to code up and test an attack in one week, much of which was spent getting permission from management to buy the WiFi cards needed for experiments. Software tocrack WEP passwords isnowfreely available. Once frames reach the AP, the distribution service determines how to route them', 'Ifthe destination islocal tothe AP, the frames can besentoutdirectly over the air. Otherwise, they will have to be forwarded over the wired network. The 312 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 integration service handles any translation that is needed for a frame to be sent outside the 802.11 LAN, or to arrive from outside the 802.11 LAN. The common case here isconnectingthewireless LAN totheInternet. Data transmission is what it is all about, so 802.11 naturally provides a data delivery service. This service lets stations transmit and receive data using the protocols we described earlier in this chapter. Since 802.11 is modeled on Ether- net and transmission over Ethernet is not guaranteed to be 100% reliable, trans- mission over 802.11 is not guaranteed to be reliable either. Higher layers must deal withdetecting andcorrecting errors. Wireless is a broadcast signal. For information sent over a wireless LAN to be kept confidential, it must be encrypted. This goal is accomplished with a pri- vacy service that manages the details of encryption and decryption. The encryp- tion algorithm for WPA2 is based on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), a U.S. government standard approved in 2002. The keys that are used for en- cryption are determined duringtheauthentication procedure. To handle traffic with different priorities, there is a QOS traffic scheduling service. It uses the protocols we described to give voice and video traffic pre- ferential treatment compared to best-effort and background traffic. A companion service also provides higher-layer timer synchronization. This lets stations coordi- nate their actions, which maybeusefulformedia processing. Finally, there are two services that help stations manage their use of the spec- trum. The transmit power control service gives stations the information they need to meet regulatory limits on transmit power that vary from region to region. The dynamic frequency selection service give stations the information they need to avoid transmitting on frequencies in the 5-GHz band that are being used for radar intheproximity. With these services, 802.11 provides a rich set of functionality for connecting nearby mobile clients tothe Internet. It has been a huge success, and the standard has repeatedly been amended to add more functionality. For a perspective on where thestandard hasbeen andwhere itisheading, see Hiertz etal.(2010). 4.5 BROADBAND WIRELESS We have been indoors too long. Let us go outdoors, where there is quite a bit of interesting networking over the so-called ‘‘last mile.’’ With the deregulation of the telephone systems in many countries, competitors to the entrenched telephone companies are now often allowed to offer local voice and high-speed Internet ser- vice. There is certainly plenty of demand. The problem is that running fiber or coax to millions of homes and businesses is prohibitively expensive. What is a competitortodo? The answer is broadband wireless. Erecting a big antenna on a hill just out- side of town is much easier and cheaper than digging many trenches and stringing SEC. 4.5 BROADBANDWIRELESS 313 cables. Thus, companies have begun to experiment with providing multimegabit wireless communication services forvoice, Internet, movies ondemand, etc. To stimulate the market, IEEE formed a group to standardize a broadband wireless metropolitan area network', 'The next number available in the 802 num- bering spacewas 802.16, so the standard gotthis number. Informally the technol- ogy is called WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access). We willusetheterms 802.16andWiMAX interchangeably. The first 802.16 standard was approved in December 2001. Early versions provided a wireless local loop between fixed points with a line of sight to each other. This design soon changed to make WiMAX a more competitive alternative to cable and DSL for Internet access. By January 2003, 802.16 had been revised to support non-line-of-sight links by using OFDM technology at frequencies be- tween 2 GHz and 10 GHz. This change made deployment much easier, though stations were still fixed locations. The rise of 3G cellular networks posed a threat by promising high data rates and mobility. In response, 802.16 was enhanced again to allow mobility at vehicular speeds by December 2005. Mobile broad- bandInternet accessisthetarget ofthecurrent standard, IEEE802.16-2009. Like the other 802 standards, 802.16 was heavily influenced by the OSI model, including the (sub)layers, terminology, service primitives, and more. Un- fortunately, also like OSI, it is fairly complicated. In fact, the WiMAX Forum was created to define interoperable subsets of the standard for commercial offer- ings. In the following sections, we will give a brief description of some of the highlights of the common forms of 802.16 air interface, but this treatment is far from complete and leaves out many details. For additional information about WiMAX andbroadband wireless ingeneral, see Andrews etal. (2007). 4.5.1 Comparison of 802.16with 802.11and 3G At this point you may be thinking: why devise a new standard? Why not just use 802.11 or 3G? In fact, WiMAX combines aspects of both 802.11 and 3G, makingitmore likea4Gtechnology. Like 802.11, WiMAX is all about wirelessly connecting devices to the Inter- net at megabit/sec speeds, instead of using cable or DSL. The devices may be mobile, or at least portable. WiMAX did not start by adding low-rate data on the side of voice-like cellular networks; 802.16 was designed to carry IP packets over the air and to connect to an IP-based wired network with a minimum of fuss. The packets maycarry peer-to-peer traffic, VoIPcalls, orstreaming media tosupporta range of applications. Also like 802.11, it is based on OFDM technology to ensure good performance in spite of wireless signal degradations such as mul- tipath fading, andonMIMOtechnologytoachieve highlevels ofthroughput. However, WiMAX ismore like 3G(and thusunlike 802.11)inseveral key re- spects. The key technical problem is to achieve high capacity by the efficient use of spectrum, so that a large number of subscribers in a coverage area can all get 314 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 high throughput. The typical distances are at least 10 times larger than for an 802.11 network. Consequently, WiMAX base stations are more powerful than 802.11 Access Points (APs). To handle weaker signals over larger distances, the base station uses more power and better antennas, and it performs more proc- essing to handle errors', 'To maximize throughput, transmissions are carefully scheduled by the base station for each particular subscriber; spectrum use is not left tochance withCSMA/CA, which maywaste capacity withcollisions. Licensed spectrum is the expected case for WiMAX, typically around 2.5 GHz in the U.S. The whole system is substantially more optimized than 802.11. This complexity is worth it, considering the large amount of money involved for licensed spectrum. Unlike 802.11, the result is a managed and reliable service withgoodsupportforqualityofservice. With all of these features, 802.16 most closely resembles the 4G cellular net- works that are now being standardized under the name LTE (Long Term Evolu- tion). While 3G cellular networks are based on CDMA and support voice and data, 4Gcellular networks willbebased onOFDM with MIMO, andtheywilltar- getdata, withvoice as justone application. Itlookslike WiMAX and 4Gare ona collision course in terms of technology and applications. Perhaps this conver- gence is unsurprising, given that the Internet is the killer application and OFDM andMIMOare thebest-knowntechnologiesforefficiently usingthespectrum. 4.5.2 The 802.16Architecture and Protocol Stack The 802.16 architecture is shown in Fig. 4-30. Base stations connect directly to the provider’s backbone network, which is in turn connected to the Internet. The base stations communicate with stations over the wireless air interface. Two kinds of stations exist. Subscriber stations remain ina fixed location, forexample, broadband Internet access for homes. Mobile stations can receive service while theyare moving,forexample, acar equipped withWiMAX. The 802.16 protocol stack that is used across the air interface is shown in Fig.4-31. The general structure is similar to that of the other 802 networks, but with more sublayers. The bottom layer deals with transmission, and here we have shown only the popular offerings of 802.16, fixed and mobile WiMAX. There is a different physical layer for each offering. Both layers operate in licensed spec- trumbelow 11GHz anduseOFDM, butindifferent ways. Above the physical layer, the data link layer consists of three sublayers. The bottom one deals with privacy and security, which is far more crucial for public outdoor networks than for private indoor networks. It manages encryption, de- cryption, andkeymanagement. Next comes the MAC common sublayer part. This part is where the main protocols, such as channel management, are located. The model here is that the base station completely controls the system. It can schedule the downlink (i.e., base to subscriber) channels very efficiently and plays a major role in managing SEC. 4.5 BROADBANDWIRELESS 315 Airinterface Mobile stations Backbonenetwork (toInternet) Base Subscriber station stations Figure4-30.

The802.16protocolstack. the uplink (i.e., subscriber to base) channels as well. An unusual feature of this MAC sublayer is that, unlike those of the other 802 protocols, it is completely connection oriented, in order to provide quality of service guarantees for tele- phonyandmultimediacommunication. The service-specific convergence sublayer takes the place of the logical link sublayer in the other 802 protocols. Its function is to provide an interface to the network layer. Different convergence layers are defined to integrate seamlessly with different upper layers', 'The important choice is IP, though the standard defines mappings for protocols such as Ethernet and ATM too. Since IP is con- nectionless and the 802.16 MAC sublayer is connection-oriented, this layer must mapbetween addresses andconnections. 316 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 4.5.3 The 802.16Physical Layer Most WiMAX deployments use licensed spectrum around either 3.5 GHz or 2.5 GHz. As with 3G, finding available spectrum is a key problem. To help, the 802.16 standard is designed for flexibility. It allows operation from 2 GHz to 11 GHz. Channels of different sizes are supported, for example, 3.5 MHz for fixed WiMAX andfrom1.25MHz to20MHz formobile WiMAX. Transmissions are sent over these channels with OFDM, the technique we de- scribed inSec. 2.5.3. Compared to802.11,the 802.16OFDM design isoptimized to make the most out of licensed spectrum and wide area transmissions. The channel is divided into more subcarriers with a longer symbol duration to tolerate larger wireless signal degradations; WiMAX parameters are around 20times larg- er than comparable 802.11parameters. Forexample, inmobile WiMAX there are 512 subcarriers for a 5-MHz channel and the time to send a symbol on each subcarrier isroughly100μsec. Symbols oneach subcarrier are sent with QPSK, QAM-16, or QAM-64, mod- ulation schemes we described in Sec. 2.5.3. When the mobile or subscriber sta- tion isnear the base station and the receivedsignal has a highsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), QAM-64 can be used to send 6 bits per symbol. To reach distant stations with a low SNR, QPSK can be used to deliver 2 bits per symbol. The data is first coded for error correction with the convolutional coding (or better schemes) that we described in Sec. 3.2.1. This coding is common on noisy channels to tolerate some bit errors without needing to send retransmissions. In fact, the modulation and coding methods should sound familiar by now as they are used for many net- works we have studied, including 802.11 cable, and DSL. The net result is that a base station can support up to 12.6 Mbps of downlink traffic and 6.2 Mbps of uplinktraffic per5-MHzchannel andpairofantennas. One thing the designers of 802.16 did not like was a certain aspect of the way GSM and DAMPS work. Both of those systems use equal frequency bands for upstream anddownstream traffic. That is,they implicitlyassume there isas much upstream traffic as downstream traffic. For voice, traffic is symmetric for the most part, but for Internet access (and certainly Web surfing) there is often more downstream traffic thanupstream traffic. The ratio isoften 2:1,3:1,ormore:1. So, the designers chose a flexible scheme for dividing the channel between stations, called OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access). With OFDMA, different sets of subcarriers can be assigned to different stations, so that more than one station can send or receive at once. If this were 802.11, all subcarriers wouldbeusedbyone station tosend at anygiven moment. The added flexibility in how bandwidth is assigned can increase performance because a given subcarrier might be faded at one receiver due to multipath effects but clear atanother. Subcarriers canbeassigned tothestations thatcan usethembest', 'As well as having asymmetric traffic, stations usually alternate between send- ing and receiving. This method is called TDD (Time Division Duplex). The SEC. 4.5 BROADBANDWIRELESS 317 alternative method,inwhich a station sends and receives at the same time (on dif- ferent subcarrier frequencies), is called FDD (Frequency Division Duplex). WiMAX allows both methods, but TDD is preferred because it is easier to imple- mentandmoreflexible.

FramestructureforOFDMAwithtimedivisionduplexing. Fig.4-32 shows an example of the frame structure that is repeated over time. It starts with a preamble to synchronize all stations, followed by downlink trans- missions from the base station. First, the base station sends maps that tell all sta- tions how the downlink and uplink subcarriers are assigned over the frame. The base station controls the maps, so it can allocate different amounts of bandwidth tostations fromframe toframe depending ontheneeds ofeachstation. Next, the base station sends bursts oftraffic todifferent subscriber and mobile stations on the subcarriers at the times given in the map. The downlink transmis- sions end with a guard time for stations to switch from receiving to transmitting. Finally, the subscriber and mobile stations send their bursts of traffic to the base station in the uplink positions that were reserved for them in the map. One of these uplink bursts is reserved for ranging, which is the process by which new stations adjust their timing and request initial bandwidth to connect to the base station. Since no connection is set up at this stage, new stations just transmit and hopethere isnocollision. 4.5.4 The 802.16MAC SublayerProtocol The data link layer is divided into three sublayers, as we saw in Fig.4-31. Since we will not study cryptography until Chap. 8, it is difficult to explain now how the security sublayer works. Suffice it to say that encryption is used to keep secret all data transmitted. Only the frame payloads are encrypted; the headers 318 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 are not. This property means that a snooper can see who is talking to whom but cannottell whattheyare sayingtoeachother. If you already know something about cryptography, what follows is a one- paragraph explanation ofthesecurity sublayer. Ifyouknownothingaboutcrypto- graphy,youare notlikely tofindthe next paragraph terribly enlightening (but you mightconsider rereading itafter finishingChap. 8). When a subscriber connectstoa base station, they perform mutual authentica- tion with RSA public-key cryptography using X.509 certificates. The payloads themselves are encrypted using a symmetric-key system, either AES (Rijndael) or DES with cipher block chaining. Integrity checking uses SHA-1. Now that was notsobad,wasit? Let us now look at the MAC common sublayer part. The MAC sublayer is connection-oriented and point-to-multipoint, which means that one base station communicates with multiple subscriber stations. Much of this design is borrowed from cable modems, in which one cable headend controls the transmissions of multiplecable modems atthecustomer premises. The downlink direction isfairly straightforward. The base station controls the physical-layer bursts that are used to send information to the different subscriber stations. The MAC sublayer simply packs its frames into this structure', 'To reduce overhead, there are several different options. For example, MAC frames may be sentindividually, orpacked back-to-back intoagroup. The uplinkchannel ismore complicated since there are competing subscribers that need access to it. Its allocation is tied closely to the quality of service issue. Fourclasses ofservice are defined, asfollows: 1. Constant bitrate service. 2. Real-time variable bitrate service. 3. Non-real-time variable bitrate service. 4. Best-effort service. All service in 802.16 is connection-oriented. Each connection gets one of these service classes, determined when the connectionisset up. This design isdifferent fromthatof802.11orEthernet, which are connectionlessinthe MACsublayer. Constant bit rate service is intended for transmitting uncompressed voice. This service needs to send a predetermined amount of data at predetermined time intervals. It is accommodated by dedicating certain bursts to each connection of this type. Once the bandwidth has been allocated, the bursts are available auto- matically, withouttheneedtoaskforeachone. Real-time variable bit rate service is for compressed multimedia and other soft real-time applications in which the amount of bandwidth needed at each in- stant may vary. It is accommodated bythe base station polling the subscriber at a fixed interval toaskhowmuchbandwidth isneeded thistime. SEC. 4.5 BROADBANDWIRELESS 319 Non-real-time variable bit rate service is for heavy transmissions that are not real time, such as large file transfers. For this service, the base station polls the subscriber often, but not at rigidly prescribed time intervals. Connections with thisservice can alsousebest-effort service, described next,torequest bandwidth. Best-effort service is for everything else. No polling is done and the sub- scriber must contend for bandwidth with other best-effort subscribers. Requests for bandwidth are sent in bursts marked in the uplink map as available for con- tention. If a request is successful, its success will be noted in the next downlink map. Ifitisnotsuccessful,theunsuccessfulsubscriber have totryagain later. To minimize collisions,theEthernet binaryexponentialbackoff algorithm isused. 4.5.5 The 802.16Frame Structure All MAC frames begin with a generic header. The header is followed by an optional payload and an optional checksum (CRC), as illustrated in Fig.4-33. The payload is not needed in control frames, for example, those requesting chan- nel slots. The checksum is (surprisingly) also optional, due tothe error correction in the physical layer and the fact that no attempt is ever made to retransmit real- time frames. If no retransmissions will be attempted, why even bother with a checksum? But if there is a checksum, it is the standard IEEE 802 CRC, and ac- knowledgementsandretransmissions are usedforreliability.

The EK field tells which of the encryption keys is being used (if any). The Length field gives the complete length of the frame, including the header', 'The Connection identifier tells which connection this frame belongs to. Finally, the Header CRC field is a checksum overtheheader only,usingthepolynomialx8 +x2 +x +1. The 802.16 protocol has many kinds of frames. An example of a different type of frame, one that is used to request bandwidth, is shown in Fig. 4-33(b). It 320 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 starts with a 1 bit instead of a 0 bit and is otherwise similar to the generic header except that the second and third bytes form a 16-bit number telling how much bandwidth is needed to carry the specified number of bytes. Bandwidth request frames donotcarry apayload orfull-frameCRC. A great deal more could be said about 802.16, but this is not the place to say it.

Ericsson company became interested in connecting its mobile phones to other devices (e.g., laptops) without cables. Together with four other companies (IBM, Intel, Nokia, and Toshiba), it formed a SIG (Special Inter- est Group, i.e., consortium) in 1998 to develop a wireless standard for intercon- necting computing and communication devices and accessories using short-range, low-power, inexpensive wireless radios. The project was named Bluetooth, after Harald Blaatand (Bluetooth) II (940–981), a Viking king who unified (i.e., con- quered) Denmark andNorway, also withoutcables. Bluetooth 1.0 was released in July 1999, and since then the SIG has never looked back. All manner of consumer electronic devices now use Bluetooth, from mobile phones and laptops to headsets, printers, keyboards, mice, gameboxes, watches, music players, navigation units, and more. The Bluetooth protocols let these devices find and connect to each other, an act called pairing, and securely transfer data. The protocols have evolved over the past decade, too. After the initial proto- cols stabilized, higher data rates were added to Bluetooth 2.0 in 2004. With the 3.0 release in 2009, Bluetooth can be used for device pairing in combination with 802.11 forhigh-throughputdata transfer. The 4.0release inDecember2009spec- ified low-power operation. That will be handy for people who do not want to change the batteries regularly in all of those devices around the house. We will cover themainaspects ofBluetooth below. 4.6.1 Bluetooth Architecture Let us start our study of the Bluetooth system with a quick overview of what it contains and what it is intended todo. The basic unit of a Bluetooth system isa piconet, which consists of a master node and uptoseven active slave nodes with- in a distance of 10 meters. Multiple piconets can exist in the same (large) room and can even be connected via a bridge node that takes part in multiple piconets, asinFig.4-34. Aninterconnectedcollection ofpiconets iscalled ascatternet. Inadditiontothe seven active slave nodes in a piconet, there can be upto255 parked nodes in the net. These are devices that the master has switched to a low- power state to reduce the drain on their batteries. In parked state, a device cannot SEC. 4.6 BLUETOOTH 321 Piconet1 Piconet2 S S S S S M S M S Active S Parked slave S slave S S Bridgeslave Figure4-34. Twopiconetscanbeconnectedtoformascatternet', 'do anything except respond to an activation or beacon signal from the master. Two intermediate power states, hold and sniff, also exist, but these will not con- cern ushere. The reason for the master/slave design is that the designers intended to facili- tate the implementation of complete Bluetooth chips for under $5. The conse- quence of this decision is that the slaves are fairly dumb, basically just doing whatever the master tells them to do. At its heart, a piconet is a centralized TDM system, with the master controlling the clock and determining which device gets tocommunicate inwhich time slot. All communication isbetween themaster and aslave; direct slave-slave communication isnotpossible. 4.6.2 Bluetooth Applications Most network protocols just provide channels between communicating enti- ties and let application designers figure out what they want to use them for. For example, 802.11 does not specify whether users should use their notebook com- puters for reading email, surfing the Web, or something else. In contrast, the Bluetooth SIG specifies particular applications to be supported and provides dif- ferent protocol stacks for each one. At the time of writing, there are 25 applica- tions,whichare called profiles. Unfortunately, thisapproach leads toavery large amount of complexity. We will omit the complexity here but will briefly look at theprofiles tosee moreclearly what theBluetooth SIGistryingtoaccomplish. Six of the profiles are for different uses of audio and video. For example, the intercom profile allows two telephones to connect as walkie-talkies. The headset and hands-free profiles both provide voice communication between a headset and its base station, as might be used for hands-free telephony while driving a car. 322 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 Other profiles are for streaming stereo-quality audio and video, say, from a port- able music player toheadphones,orfromadigital camera toaTV. The human interface device profile is for connecting keyboards and mice to computers. Other profiles let a mobile phone or other computer receive images from a camera or send images toa printer. Perhaps of more interest is a profile to useamobile phoneasaremote control fora(Bluetooth-enabled) TV. Still other profiles enable networking. The personal area network profile lets Bluetooth devices form an ad hoc network or remotely access another network, such as an 802.11 LAN, via an access point. The dial-up networking profile was actually the original motivation for the whole project. It allows a notebook com- puter to connect to a mobile phone containing a built-in modem without using wires. Profiles for higher-layer information exchange have also been defined. The synchronization profile is intended for loading data into a mobile phone when it leaves homeandcollecting data fromitwhenitreturns. We will skip the rest of the profiles, except to mention that some profiles serve as building blocks onwhich the aboveprofiles are built. The generic access profile, onwhich all ofthe other profiles are built, provides a way to establish and maintain secure links (channels) between the master and the slaves. The other generic profiles define the basics of object exchange and audio and video tran- sport. Utility profiles are used widely for functions such as emulating a serial line, whichisespecially usefulformanylegacy applications', 'Was it really necessary to spell out all these applications in detail and provide different protocol stacks for each one? Probably not, but there were a number of different working groups that devised different parts of the standard, and each one just focused on its specific problem and generated its own profile. Think of this as Conway’s Law in action. (In the April 1968 issue of Datamation magazine, Melvin Conway observed that if you assign n people towrite a compiler, youwill getann-pass compiler, ormore generally, thesoftware structure mirrors the struc- ture of the group that produced it.) It would probably have been possible to get away with two protocol stacks instead of 25, one for file transfer and one for streaming real-time communication. 4.6.3 The Bluetooth Protocol Stack The Bluetooth standard has many protocols grouped loosely into the layers shown in Fig.4-35. The first observation to make is that the structure does not followtheOSImodel, theTCP/IP model, the802model, oranyothermodel. The bottom layer is the physical radio layer, which corresponds fairly well to the physicallayer inthe OSI and 802models. Itdeals withradiotransmission and modulation. Many of the concerns here have to do with the goal of making the system inexpensive sothatitcan become amass-market item.

TheBluetoothprotocolarchitecture. The link control (or baseband) layer is somewhat analogous to the MAC sub- layer but also includes elements of the physical layer. It deals with how the mas- ter controls timeslotsandhowthese slotsare groupedintoframes. Next come two protocols that use the link control protocol. The link manager handles the establishment of logical channels between devices, including power management, pairing andencryption, andqualityof service. It lies below the host controller interface line. This interface is a convenience for implementation: typi- cally, the protocols below the line will be implemented on a Bluetooth chip, and the protocols above the line will be implemented on the Bluetooth device that hoststhechip. The link protocol above the line is L2CAP (Logical Link Control Adapta- tion Protocol). It frames variable-length messages and provides reliability if needed. Many protocols use L2CAP, such as the two utility protocols that are shown. The service discovery protocol is used to locate services within the net- work. The RFcomm (Radio Frequency communication) protocol emulates the standard serial port found on PCs for connecting the keyboard, mouse, and modem, amongother devices. The top layer is where the applications are located. The profiles are repres- ented byvertical boxesbecause they eachdefine a slice ofthe protocol stack fora particular purpose. Specific profiles, such as the headset profile, usually contain only those protocols needed by that application and no others. For example, pro- files may include L2CAP if they have packets to send but skip L2CAP if they have onlyasteady flowofaudiosamples. In the following sections, we will examine the Bluetooth radio layer and vari- ous link protocols, since these roughly correspond to the physical and MAC sublayers intheother procotol stacks wehavestudied. 324 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP', '4 4.6.4 The Bluetooth Radio Layer The radio layer moves the bits from master to slave, or vice versa. It is a low-power system with a range of 10 meters operating in the same 2.4-GHz ISM band as 802.11. The band is divided into 79 channels of 1 MHz each. To coexist with other networks using the ISM band, frequency hopping spread spectrum is used. There can be up to 1600 hops/sec over slots with a dwell time of 625 μsec. All the nodes in a piconet hop frequencies simultaneously, following the slot tim- ingandpseudorandomhopsequence dictated bythemaster. Unfortunately, it turned out that early versions of Bluetooth and 802.11 inter- fered enough to ruin each other’s transmissions. Some companies responded by banning Bluetooth altogether, but eventually a technical solution was devised. The solution is for Bluetooth to adapt its hop sequence to exclude channels on which there are other RF signals. This process reduces the harmful interference. Itiscalled adaptive frequency hopping. Three forms of modulation are used to send bits on a channel. The basic scheme istouse frequency shiftkeying tosend a1-bitsymbolevery microsecond, giving a gross data rate of 1 Mbps. Enhanced rates were introduced with the 2.0 version of Bluetooth. These rates use phase shift keying to send either 2 or 3 bits per symbol, for gross data rates of 2 or 3 Mbps. The enhanced rates are only used inthedata portionofframes. 4.6.5 The Bluetooth Link Layers The link control (or baseband) layer is the closest thing Bluetooth has to a MAC sublayer. It turns the raw bit stream into frames and defines some key for- mats. In the simplest form, the master in each piconet defines a series of 625- μsec time slots, with the master’s transmissions starting in the even slots and the slaves’ transmissions starting in the odd ones. This scheme is traditional time di- vision multiplexing, with the master getting half the slots and the slaves sharing theother half. Frames can be1,3,or5slots long. Each frame has anoverhead of 126 bits for an access code and header, plus a settling time of 250–260 μsec per hop to allow the inexpensive radio circuits to become stable. The payload of the frame can be encrypted for confidentiality with a key that is chosen when the master and slave connect. Hops only happen between frames, not during a frame. The result isthata5-slotframe ismuchmoreefficient thana1-slotframe because theoverhead isconstant butmoredata issent. The link manager protocol sets up logical channels, called links, to carry frames between the master and a slave device that have discovered each other. A pairing procedure is followed to make sure that the two devices are allowed to communicate before the link is used. The old pairing method is that both devices must be configured with the same four-digit PIN (Personal Identification Num- ber). The matching PIN is how each device would know that it was connectingto SEC. 4.6 BLUETOOTH 325 the right remote device. However, unimaginative users and devices default to PINs such as ‘‘0000’’ and ‘‘1234’’ meant that this method provided very little se- curity inpractice', 'The newsecure simple pairing methodenables users toconfirm that bothde- vices are displaying the same passkey, or to observe the passkey on one device and enter it into the second device. This method is more secure because users do not have to choose or set a PIN. They merely confirm a longer, device-generated passkey. Of course, it cannot be used on some devices with limited input/output, suchasahands-freeheadset. Once pairing is complete, the link manager protocol sets up the links. Two main kinds of links exist to carry user data. The first is the SCO (Synchronous Connection Oriented) link. It is used for real-time data, such as telephone con- nections. This type oflink isallocated afixed slotineachdirection. Aslave may have up to three SCO links with its master. Each SCO link can transmit one 64,000-bps PCM audio channel. Due to the time-critical nature of SCO links, frames sent over them are never retransmitted. Instead, forward error correction can beusedtoincrease reliability. The other kind is the ACL (Asynchronous ConnectionLess) link. This type of link is used for packet-switched data that is available at irregular intervals. ACL traffic is delivered on a best-effort basis. No guarantees are given. Frames can be lost and may have to be retransmitted. A slave may have only one ACL linktoitsmaster. The data sent over ACL links come from the L2CAP layer. This layer has four major functions. First, it accepts packets of up to 64 KB from the upper lay- ers and breaks them into frames for transmission. At the far end, the frames are reassembled into packets. Second, it handles the multiplexing and demultiplexing of multiple packet sources. When a packet has been reassembled, the L2CAP layer determines which upper-layer protocol to hand it to, for example, RFcomm or service discovery. Third, L2CAP handles error control and retransmission. It detects errors and resends packets that were not acknowledged. Finally, L2CAP enforces qualityofservice requirements between multiplelinks. 4.6.6 The Bluetooth Frame Structure Bluetooth defines several frame formats, the most important of which is shownintwoformsinFig.4-36. Itbeginswithanaccesscodethatusually identi- fiesthemaster sothatslaves within radio range oftwomasters can tell which traf- fic is for them. Next comes a 54-bit header containing typical MAC sublayer fields. Ifthe frame issent at the basic rate, the data field comes next. It has upto 2744 bits for a five-slot transmission. For a single time slot, the format is the same except thatthedata field is240bits. If the frame is sent at the enhanced rate, the data portion may have up to two or three times as many bits because each symbol carries 2 or 3 bits instead of 1 326 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 Bits 72 54 0–2744 Accesscode Header Data(at1Xrate) 3 4 1 1 1 8 Addr Type FAS CRC Repeated3times Bits 72 54 16 0–8184 2 Accesscode Header Guard/Sync Data(at2Xor3Xrate) Trailer 5x675microsecslots (a)Basicratedataframe,top (b)Enhancedratedataframe,bottom Figure4-36. TypicalBluetoothdataframeat(a)basicand(b)enhanced,datarates. bit. These data are preceded bya guard field and a synchronization pattern that is used to switch to the faster data rate', 'That is, the access code and header are car- ried at the basic rate and only the data portion is carried at the faster rate. Enhanced-rate frames endwithashorttrailer. Let us take a quick look at the common header. The Address field identifies which of the eight active devices the frame is intended for. The Type field identi- fies the frame type (ACL, SCO, poll, or null), the type of error correction used in the data field, andhowmany slots longthe frame is. TheFlow bitisasserted bya slave when its buffer is full and cannot receive any more data. This bit enables a primitive form of flow control. The Acknowledgement bit is used topiggybackan ACK onto a frame. The Sequence bit is used to number the frames to detect re- transmissions. The protocol is stop-and-wait, so 1 bit is enough. Then comes the 8-bit header Checksum. The entire 18-bit header is repeated three times to form the 54-bit header shown in Fig.4-36. On the receiving side, a simple circuit ex- amines allthree copies ofeachbit. Ifallthree are thesame, the bitisaccepted. If not, the majority opinion wins. Thus, 54 bits of transmission capacity are used to send 10bits of header. The reason is that to reliably send data in a noisy environ- ment using cheap, low-powered (2.5 mW) devices with little computing capacity, agreat deal ofredundancyisneeded. Various formats are used for the data field for ACL and SCO frames. The basic-rate SCO frames are a simple example to study: the data field is always 240 bits. Three variants are defined, permitting 80, 160, or 240 bits of actual payload, with the rest being used for error correction. In the most reliable version (80-bit payload), thecontents are justrepeated three times, thesame astheheader. We can workoutthe capacity withthis frame as follows. Since the slave may use onlytheoddslots,itgets800slots/sec, justasthemaster does. Withan80-bit SEC. 4.6 BLUETOOTH 327 payload, the channel capacity from the slave is 64,000 bps as is the channel ca- pacity from the master. This capacity is exactly enough for a single full-duplex PCM voice channel (which is why a hoprate of 1600 hops/sec was chosen). That is, despite a raw bandwidth of 1 Mbps, a single full-duplex uncompressed voice channel can completely saturate the piconet. The efficiency of 13% is the result of spending 41% of the capacity on settling time, 20% on headers, and 26% on repetition coding. This shortcoming highlights the value of the enhanced rates andframes ofmore thanasingle slot. There is much more to be said about Bluetooth, but no more space to say it here. Forthecurious, theBluetooth 4.0specification contains allthedetails. 4.7 RFID We have lookedatMACdesignsfromLANs uptoMANsanddowntoPANs. As a last example, we will study a category of low-end wireless devices that peo- ple may not recognize as forming a computer network: the RFID (Radio Fre- quency IDentification)tagsandreaders thatwedescribed inSec. 1.5.4. RFID technology takes many forms, used in smartcards, implants for pets, passports, library books, and more', 'The form that we will look at was developed in the quest for an EPC (Electronic Product Code) that started with the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999. An EPC is a re- placement for a barcode that can carry a larger amount of information and is elec- tronically readable over distances upto10m,even when it isnotvisible. Itisdif- ferent technology than, for example, the RFID used in passports,which must be placed quite close to a reader to perform a transaction. The ability to communi- cate overadistance makes EPCs more relevant toourstudies. EPCglobal was formed in 2003 to commercialize the RFID technology devel- oped by the Auto-ID Center. The effort got a boost in 2005 when Walmart re- quired its top 100 suppliers to label all shipments with RFID tags. Widespread deployment has been hampered by the difficulty of competing with cheap printed barcodes, butnew uses, such as indrivers licenses, are now growing. We will de- scribe the second generation of this technology, which is informally called EPC Gen 2(EPCglobal, 2008). 4.7.1 EPC Gen 2Architecture The architecture ofan EPC Gen 2RFID network isshowninFig. 4-37. It has two key components: tags and readers. RFID tags are small, inexpensive devices that have a unique 96-bit EPC identifier and a small amount of memory that can be read and written bythe RFID reader. The memory might be used torecord the location historyofanitem, forexample, asitmoves throughthesupplychain. 328 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 Often, the tags look like stickers that can be placed on, for example, pairs of jeans onthe shelves inastore. Mostofthesticker istaken upbyanantenna thatis printed onto it. A tiny dot in the middle is the RFID integrated circuit. Alterna- tively, theRFIDtags canbeintegrated intoanobject, suchasadriver’s license. In both cases, the tags have no battery and they must gather power from the radio transmissions of a nearby RFID reader to run. This kind of tag is called a ‘‘Class 1’’tagtodistinguishitfrommorecapable tagsthathave batteries. Reader Backscatter signal signal RFID RFID reader tag Figure4-37. RFIDarchitecture. The readers are the intelligence in the system, analogous to base stations and access points in cellular and WiFi networks. Readers are much more powerful than tags. They have their own power sources, often have multiple antennas, and are in charge of when tags send and receive messages. As there will commonly be multiple tags within the reading range, the readers must solve the multiple ac- cess problem. There may be multiple readers that can contend with each other in thesame area, too. The main job of the reader is to inventory the tags in the neighborhood, that is, to discover the identifiers of the nearby tags. The inventory is accomplished with the physical layer protocol and the tag-identification protocol that are out- linedinthefollowing sections. 4.7.2 EPC Gen 2Physical Layer The physical layer defines how bits are sent between the RFID reader and tags. Much of it uses methods for sending wireless signals that we have seen pre- viously. In the U.S., transmissions are sent in the unlicensed 902–928 MHz ISM band', 'This band falls in the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) range, so the tags are referred to as UHF RFID tags. The reader performs frequency hopping at least every 400 msec to spread its signal across the channel, to limit interference and satisfy regulatory requirements. The reader and tags use forms of ASK (Ampli- tude Shift Keying) modulation that we described in Sec. 2.5.2 to encode bits. They take turnstosendbits,sothelinkishalf duplex. SEC. 4.7 RFID 329 There are two main differences from other physical layers that we have stud- ied. The first is that the reader is always transmitting a signal, regardless of whether it is the reader or tag that is communicating. Naturally, the reader trans- mits a signal tosend bits to tags. For the tags to send bitstothe reader, the reader transmits a fixed carrier signal that carries no bits. The tags harvest this signal to get the power they need to run; otherwise, a tag would not be able to transmit in the first place. To send data, a tag changes whether it is reflecting the signal from thereader, likearadar signal bouncingoffatarget, orabsorbingit. This methodiscalled backscatter. Itdiffers from all the other wireless situa- tions we have seen so far, in which the sender and receiver never both transmit at the same time. Backscatter is a low-energy way for the tag to create a weak sig- nal of its own that shows up at the reader. For the reader to decode the incoming signal, it mustfilteroutthe outgoingsignal that it is transmitting. Because the tag signal is weak, tags can only send bits to the reader at a low rate, and tags cannot receiveorevensense transmissions fromother tags. The seconddifference isthatverysimple formsofmodulationare used sothat they can be implemented on a tag that runs on very little power and costs only a few cents to make. To send data to the tags, the reader uses two amplitude levels. Bits are determined to be either a 0 or a 1, depending on how long the reader waits before a low-power period. The tag measures the time between low-power periods and compares this time to a reference measured during a preamble. As showninFig.4-38,1sare longerthan0s. Tag responses consist of the tag alternating its backscatter state at fixed inter- vals to create a series of pulses in the signal. Anywhere from one to eight pulse periods can be used to encode each 0 or 1, depending on the need for reliability. 1s have fewer transitions than 0s, as is shown with an example of two-pulse period codinginFig. 4-38. Backscatter Reader Reader “0” “1” Tag Tag “0” “1” Power Time Figure4-38. Readerandtagbackscattersignals. 4.7.3 EPC Gen 2TagIdentification Layer Toinventory the nearby tags, the reader needs toreceiveamessage fromeach tag that gives the identifier forthe tag. This situation isamultipleaccessproblem for which the number of tags is unknown in the general case. The reader might 330 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 broadcast a query to ask all tags to send their identifiers. However, tags that re- plied right away would then collide in much the same way as stations on a classic Ethernet', 'We have seen many ways of tackling the multiple access problem in this chapter. The closest protocol for the current situation, in which the tags cannot hear each others’ transmissions, is slotted ALOHA, one of the earliest protocols westudied. Thisprotocol isadapted foruseinGen2RFID. The sequence of messages used to identify a tag is shown in Fig.4-39. In the first slot (slot 0), the reader sends a Query message to start the process. Each QRepeat message advances to the next slot. The reader also tells the tags the range of slots over which to randomize transmissions. Using a range is necessary because the reader synchronizes tags when it starts the process; unlike stations on anEthernet, tagsdonotwake upwithamessage atatimeoftheir choosing. RFIDreader RFIDtag Query(slot0) QRepeat(slot1) QRepeat(slot2) RN16(slot2) Time Ack EPCidentifier QRepeat(slot3) . . . QRepeat(slotN) Figure4-39. Examplemessageexchangetoidentifyatag. Tags pick a random slot in which to reply. In Fig.4-39, the tag replies in slot 2. However, tags do not send their identifiers when they first reply. Instead, a tag sends a short 16-bit random number in an RN16 message. If there is no collision, the reader receives this message and sends an ACK message of its own. At this stage, thetaghasacquired theslotandsendsitsEPC identifier. The reason for this exchange is that EPC identifiers are long, so collisions on these messages would be expensive. Instead, a short exchange is used to test whether thetagcan safely usetheslottosenditsidentifier. Once itsidentifier has been successfully transmitted, the tag temporarily stops responding to new Query messages sothatalltheremaining tagscan beidentified. SEC. 4.7 RFID 331 A key problem is for the reader to adjust the number of slots to avoid collis- ions, but without using so many slots that performance suffers. This adjustment is analogous to binary exponential backoff in Ethernet. If the reader sees too many slots with no responses or too many slots with collisions, it can send a QAdjust message to decrease or increase the range of slots over which the tags are re- sponding. The RFID reader can perform other operations on the tags. For example, it can select a subset of tags before running an inventory, allowing it to collect re- sponses from, say, tagged jeans but not tagged shirts. The reader can also write data totags as they are identified. This feature could be used torecord thepointof sale orother relevant information. 4.7.4 TagIdentification Message Formats The format of the Query message is shown in Fig. 4-40 as an example of a reader-to-tag message. The message is compact because the downlink rates are limited, from 27 kbps up to 128 kbps. The Command field carries the code 1000 toidentify themessage asaQuery. Bits 4 1 2 1 2 2 1 4 5 Command DR M TR Sel Session Target Q CRC 1000 Physicalparameters Tagselection Figure4-40. FormatoftheQuerymessage. The next flags, DR, M, and TR, determine the physical layer parameters for reader transmissions and tag responses. For example, the response rate may be set tobetween 5kbpsand640kbps.We willskipoverthedetails ofthese flags. Then come three fields, Sel, Session, and Target, that select the tags to re- spond', 'As well as the readers being able to select a subset of identifiers, the tags keep track ofuptofourconcurrent sessions and whether they have been identified in those sessions. In this way, multiple readers can operate in overlapping cover- age areas byusingdifferent sessions. Next is the most important parameter for this command, Q. This field defines the range of slots over which tags will respond, from 0to 2Q−1. Finally, there is a CRCtoprotect themessage fields. At5bits, it isshorter than mostCRCswe have seen, buttheQuery message ismuchshorter thanmostpackets too. Tag-to-reader messages are simpler. Since the reader is in control, it knows what message to expect in response to each of its transmissions. The tag re- sponsessimplycarry data, suchastheEPC identifier. 332 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 Originally the tags were just for identification purposes. However, they have grown over time to resemble very small computers. Some research tags have sen- sors and are able to run small programs to gather and process data (Sample et al., 2008). One visionforthistechnologyisthe ‘‘Internet ofthings’’thatconnectsob- jects in the physical world to the Internet (Welbourne et al., 2009; and Gershen- feld etal., 2004). 4.8 DATA LINK LAYER SWITCHING Many organizations have multiple LANs and wish to connect them. Would it not be convenient if we could just join the LANs together to make a larger LAN? In fact, we can do this when the connections are made with devices called bridges. The Ethernet switches we described inSec. 4.3.4are a modern name for bridges; they provide functionality that goes beyond classic Ethernet and Ethernet hubs to make it easy to join multiple LANs into a larger and faster network. We shall usetheterms ‘‘bridge’’and‘‘switch’’interchangeably. Bridges operate in the data link layer, so they examine the data link layer ad- dresses to forward frames. Since they are not supposed to examine the payload field ofthe frames they forward, they can handle IP packets as well as other kinds of packets, such as AppleTalk packets. In contrast, routers examine the addresses inpackets androute based onthem, sothey onlyworkwith the protocols that they were designed tohandle. Inthissection, we willlook at how bridges work and are used to join multiple physical LANs into a single logical LAN. We will also look at how to do the re- verse and treat one physical LAN as multiple logical LANs, called VLANs (Vir- tual LANs). Both technologies provide useful flexibility for managing networks. For acomprehensive treatment ofbridges, switches, and related topics, see Seifert andEdwards (2008)andPerlman (2000). 4.8.1 Uses of Bridges Before getting into the technology of bridges, let us take a look at some com- mon situations in which bridges are used. We will mention three reasons why a single organization mayendupwithmultipleLANs. First, many university and corporate departments have their own LANs to connect their own personal computers, servers, and devices such as printers. Since the goals of the various departments differ, different departments may set up different LANs, without regard to what other departments are doing. Sooner or later, though, there is a need for interaction, so bridges are needed. In this ex- ample, multipleLANscome intoexistence duetotheautonomyoftheir owners. SEC', '4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 333 Second, the organization may be geographically spread over several buildings separated by considerable distances. It may be cheaper to have separate LANs in each building and connect them with bridges and a few long-distance fiber optic links than torunall the cables toa single central switch. Even iflaying the cables is easy to do, there are limits on their lengths (e.g., 200 m for twisted-pair gigabit Ethernet). The network would not work for longer cables due to the excessive signal attenuation or round-trip delay. The only solution is to partition the LAN andinstall bridges tojoin the piecestoincrease thetotal physicaldistance thatcan becovered. Third, it may be necessary to split what is logically a single LAN into sepa- rate LANs (connected by bridges) to accommodate the load. At many large uni- versities, for example, thousands of workstations are available for student and faculty computing. Companies may also have thousandsofemployees. The scale of this system precludes putting all the workstations on a single LAN—there are more computers than portsonanyEthernet huband more stations than allowed on asingle classic Ethernet. Even if it were possible to wire all the workstations together, putting more stations on an Ethernet hub or classic Ethernet would not add capacity. All of the stations share the same, fixed amount of bandwidth. The more stations there are, thelessaverage bandwidth perstation. However, two separate LANs have twice the capacity of a single LAN. Bridges let the LANs be joined together while keeping this capacity. The key is not to send traffic onto ports where it is not needed, so that each LAN can run at fullspeed. Thisbehavior alsoincreases reliability,since onasingleLAN adefec- tive nodethat keeps outputtingacontinuousstream ofgarbage can clog upthe en- tire LAN. By deciding what to forward and what not to forward, bridges act like fire doorsinabuilding,preventing asingle nodethathasgoneberserk frombring- ingdowntheentire system. To make these benefits easily available, ideally bridges should be completely transparent. It should be possible to go out and buy bridges, plug the LAN cables into the bridges, and have everything work perfectly, instantly. There should be nohardware changes required, nosoftware changes required, nosettingofaddress switches, nodownloading ofroutingtables orparameters, nothing at all. Just plug in the cables and walk away. Furthermore, the operation of the existing LANs should not be affected by the bridges at all. As far as the stations are concerned, there should be no observable difference whether or not they are part of a bridged LAN. It should be as easy to move stations around the bridged LAN as it is to movethemaroundasingle LAN. Surprisingly enough, it is actually possible to create bridges that are transpar- ent. Two algorithms are used: a backward learning algorithm tostop traffic being sent where it is not needed; and a spanning tree algorithm to break loops that may be formed when switches are cabled together willy-nilly. Let us now take a look atthese algorithms inturntolearn howthismagic isaccomplished. 334 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 4.8.2 Learning Bridges The topology of two LANs bridged together is shown in Fig. 4-41 for two cases', 'On the left-hand side, two multidrop LANs, such as classic Ethernets, are joinedbyaspecial station—the bridge—that sitsonbothLANs. Onthe right-hand side, LANs with point-to-point cables, including one hub,are joined together. The bridges are the devices to which the stations and hub are attached. If the LAN technologyisEthernet, thebridges are better knownasEthernet switches. A D Hub Port E A 1 Port 1 D E 2 2 B B1 B B1 B2 H1 1 2 3 4 4 3 F F C G Bridge Bridge C G (a) (b) Figure4-41. (a) Bridge connecting two multidrop LANs. (b) Bridges (and a hub)connectingsevenpoint-to-pointstations. Bridges were developed when classic Ethernets were in use, so they are often shown in topologies with multidrop cables, as in Fig. 4-41(a). However, all the topologies that are encountered today are comprised of point-to-point cables and switches. The bridges work the same way in both settings. All of the stations at- tached to the same port on a bridge belong to the same collision domain, and this isdifferent than the collisiondomain forother ports. Ifthere ismorethanonesta- tion, as in a classic Ethernet, a hub, or a half-duplex link, the CSMA/CD protocol isusedtosendframes. There is a difference, however, in how the bridged LANs are built. To bridge multidrop LANs, a bridge is added as a new station on each of the multidrop LANs, as inFig.4-41(a). To bridge point-to-point LANs, the hubsare either con- nected to a bridge or, preferably, replaced with a bridge to increase performance. InFig.4-41(b), bridgeshave replacedall butonehub. Different kinds of cables can also be attached to one bridge. For example, the cable connecting bridge B1 to bridge B2 in Fig. 4-41(b) might be a long-distance fiber optic link, while the cable connecting the bridges to stations might be a short-haul twisted-pair line. This arrangement is useful for bridging LANs in dif- ferent buildings. Now let us consider what happens inside the bridges. Each bridge operates in promiscuous mode, that is, it accepts every frame transmitted by the stations SEC. 4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 335 attached to each of its ports. The bridge must decide whether to forward or dis- card eachframe, and,iftheformer, onwhich porttooutputtheframe. Thisdecis- ion is made by using the destination address. As an example, consider the topo- logyofFig.4-41(a). Ifstation Asendsaframe tostation B,bridgeB1willreceive the frame on port 1. This frame can be immediately discarded without further ado because it is already onthe correct port. However, in the topology ofFig. 4-41(b) suppose that A sends a frame to D. Bridge B1 willreceive the frame onport 1 and output it on port 4. Bridge B2 will then receive the frame on its port 4 and output itonitsport1. Asimple waytoimplement thisscheme istohave abig(hash) table inside the bridge. The table can list each possible destination and which output port it be- longs on. For example, in Fig. 4-41(b), the table at B1 would list D as belonging to port 4, since all B1 has to know is which port to put frames on to reach D. That, in fact, more forwarding will happen later when the frame hits B2 is not of interest toB1', 'When the bridges are first plugged in, all the hash tables are empty. None of the bridges know where any of the destinations are, so they use a flooding algo- rithm: every incoming frame for an unknown destination is output on all the ports to which the bridge is connected except the one it arrived on. As time goes on, the bridges learn where destinations are. Once a destination is known, frames destined foritare putonlyontheproperport;theyare notflooded. The algorithm used by the bridges is backward learning. As mentioned above, the bridges operate in promiscuous mode, so they see every frame sent on any of their ports. By looking at the source addresses, they can tell which ma- chines are accessible on which ports. For example, if bridge B1 in Fig. 4-41(b) sees a frame on port 3 coming from C, it knows that C must be reachable via port 3, so it makes an entry in its hash table. Any subsequent frame addressed to C comingintoB1onanyother portwillbeforwarded toport3. The topology can change as machines and bridges are powered up and down and moved around. To handle dynamic topologies,whenever a hash table entry is made, the arrival time of the frame is noted in the entry. Whenever a frame whose source is already in the table arrives, its entry is updated with the current time. Thus, the time associated with every entry tells the last time a frame from thatmachine was seen. Periodically, aprocess inthe bridge scans the hash table andpurges all entries more than a few minutes old. In this way, if a computer is unplugged from its LAN, moved around the building, and plugged in again somewhere else, within a few minutes it will be back in normal operation, without any manual intervention. This algorithm also means that if a machine is quiet for a few minutes, any traffic senttoitwillhave tobefloodeduntilitnextsendsaframe itself. The routing procedure foranincoming frame depends onthe port it arrives on (the source port) and the address to which it is destined (the destination address). The procedure isasfollows. 336 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 1. If the port for the destination address is the same as the source port, discard theframe. 2. If the port for the destination address and the source port are dif- ferent, forward theframe ontothedestination port. 3. If the destination port is unknown, use flooding and send the frame onallportsexcept thesource port. You might wonder whether the first case can occur with point-to-point links. The answer is that it can occur if hubs are used to connect a group of computers to a bridge. Anexample isshowninFig. 4-41(b) where stations Eand Fare connected to hub H1, which is in turn connected to bridge B2. If E sends a frame to F, the hub will relay it to B2 as well as to F. That is what hubs do—they wire all ports together so that a frame input on one port is simply output on all other ports. The frame will arrive at B2 on port 4, which is already the right output port to reach thedestination', 'Bridge B2need onlydiscard theframe. As each frame arrives, this algorithm must be applied, so it is usually imple- mented with special-purpose VLSI chips. The chips dothe lookup and update the table entry, all in a few microseconds. Because bridges only look at the MAC ad- dresses to decide how to forward frames, it is possible to start forwarding as soon asthedestination header field hascome in,before therestoftheframe hasarrived (provided the output line is available, of course). This design reduces the latency of passing through the bridge, as well as the number of frames that the bridge must be able to buffer. It is referred to as cut-through switching or wormhole routing andisusually handled inhardware. We can look at the operation of a bridge in terms of protocol stacks to under- stand what itmeans tobealinklayer device. Consider aframe sentfromstation A to station D in the configuration of Fig. 4-41(a), in which the LANs are Ethernet. The frame will pass through one bridge. The protocol stack view of processing is showninFig.4-42. The packet comes from a higher layer and descends into the Ethernet MAC layer. It acquires an Ethernet header (and also a trailer, not shown in the figure). This unit is passed to the physical layer, goes out over the cable, and is picked up bythebridge. In the bridge, the frame is passed up from the physical layer to the Ethernet MAC layer. This layer has extended processing compared to the Ethernet MAC layer at a station. It passes the frame to a relay, still within the MAC layer. The bridge relay function uses only the Ethernet MAC header to determine how to handle the frame. In this case, it passes the frame to the Ethernet MAC layer of theportusedtoreachstation D,andtheframe continues onitsway. In the general case, relays at a given layer can rewrite the headers for that layer. VLANs will provide an example shortly. In no case should the bridge look inside the frame and learn that it is carrying an IP packet; that is irrelevant to the SEC. 4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 337 StationA StationD Network Packet Packet Bridge Ethernet Relay Eth Packet Eth Packet Eth Packet Eth Packet MAC Physical Eth Packet Eth Packet Eth Packet Eth Packet Wire Wire Figure4-42. Protocolprocessingatabridge. bridge processing and would violate protocol layering. Also note that a bridge with k ports will have k instances of MAC and physical layers. The value of k is 2 foroursimple example. 4.8.3 Spanning Tree Bridges To increase reliability, redundant links can be used between bridges. In the example of Fig. 4-43, there are two links in parallel between a pair of bridges. This design ensures that if one link is cut, the network will not be partitioned into twosetsofcomputers thatcannottalktoeachother. FrameF 0 A F 1 F B1 2 F B2 3 F 4 Bridge Redundantlinks Figure4-43. Bridgeswithtwoparallellinks. However, this redundancy introduces some additional problems because it creates loopsinthe topology. Anexample ofthese problems can be seen bylook- ing at how a frame sent by A to a previously unobserved destination is handled in Fig.4-43', 'Each bridge follows the normal rule for handling unknown destina- tions, which is to flood the frame. Call the frame from A that reaches bridge B1 frame F . The bridge sends copies of this frame out all of its other ports. We 0 338 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 willonlyconsider thebridgeportsthatconnectB1toB2(thoughthe frame willbe sent out the other ports, too). Since there are two links from B1 to B2, two copies oftheframe willreachB2.They are showninFig.4-43asF andF . 1 2 Shortlythereafter, bridgeB2receivesthese frames. However, it does not(and cannot) know that they are copies of the same frame, rather than two different frames sent one after the other. So bridge B2 takes F and sends copies of it out 1 all the other ports, and it also takes F and sends copies of it out all the other 2 ports. This produces frames F and F that are sent along the two links back to 3 4 B1. Bridge B1 then sees two new frames with unknown destinations and copies themagain. Thiscycle goesonforever. The solution to this difficulty is for the bridges to communicate with each other and overlay the actual topology with a spanning tree that reaches every bridge. In effect, some potential connections between bridges are ignored in the interest of constructing a fictitious loop-free topology that is a subset of the actual topology. For example, in Fig. 4-44 we see five bridges that are interconnected and also have stations connected to them. Each station connects to only one bridge. There are some redundant connections between the bridges so that frames will be for- warded in loops if all of the links are used. This topology can be thought of as a graph in which the bridges are the nodes and the point-to-point links are the edges. The graph can be reduced to a spanning tree, which has no cycles by defi- nition, by dropping the links shown as dashed lines in Fig.4-44. Using this span- ningtree, there isexactly onepath fromevery station toevery otherstation. Once the bridges have agreed on the spanning tree, all forwarding between stations fol- lows the spanning tree. Since there is a unique path from each source to each destination, loopsare impossible. Station Root B1 B3 B5 bridge Bridge Linkthatisnotpart B2 B4 ofthespanningtree Figure4-44. A spanning tree connecting five bridges. The dashed lines are linksthatarenotpartofthespanningtree. To build the spanning tree, the bridges run a distributed algorithm. Each bridge periodically broadcasts a configuration message out all of its ports to its SEC. 4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 339 neighbors and processes the messages it receives from other bridges, as described next. These messages are not forwarded, since their purpose is to build the tree, whichcan thenbeusedforforwarding. The bridges must first choose one bridge to be the root of the spanning tree. To make this choice, they each include an identifier based on their MAC address inthe configuration message, as well as the identifier of the bridge they believe to be the root. MAC addresses are installed by the manufacturer and guaranteed to be unique worldwide, which makes these identifiers convenient and unique', 'The bridges choose the bridge with the lowest identifier to be the root. After enough messages have been exchanged to spread the news, all bridges will agree on which bridge is the root. In Fig.4-44, bridge B1 has the lowest identifier and be- comes theroot. Next, a tree of shortest paths from the root to every bridge is constructed. In Fig.4-44, bridges B2 and B3 can each be reached from bridge B1 directly, in one hopthat isashortest path. Bridge B4can be reachedin two hops,via either B2 or B3. To break this tie, the path via the bridge with the lowest identifier is chosen, soB4isreachedviaB2. Bridge B5canbereachedintwohopsviaB3. Tofindthese shortest paths, bridges include the distance from the root in their configuration messages. Each bridge remembers the shortest path it finds to the root. The bridgesthenturnoffportsthatare notpart oftheshortest path. Although the tree spans all the bridges, not all the links (or even bridges) are necessarily present in the tree. This happens because turning off the ports prunes some links from the network to prevent loops. Even after the spanning tree has been established, the algorithm continues to run during normal operation to auto- matically detect topologychanges andupdatethetree. The algorithm for constructing the spanning tree was invented by Radia Perl- man. Her job was to solve the problem of joining LANs without loops. She was given a week to do it, but she came up with the idea for the spanning tree algo- rithm in a day. Fortunately, this left her enough time to write it as a poem (Perl- man,1985): IthinkthatIshallneversee Agraphmore lovely thanatree. Atree whosecrucial property Isloop-freeconnectivity.

In 2001, it was revised to more rapidly find a new spanning tree after atopologychange. Foradetailed treatment ofbridges, see Perlman (2000). 4.8.4 Repeaters, Hubs, Bridges, Switches, Routers, and Gateways So far in this book, we have looked at a variety of ways to get frames and packets from one computer to another. We have mentioned repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, and gateways. All of these devices are incommon use, but they all differ in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Since there are so many of them, it is probably worth taking a look at them together to see what the simi- laritiesanddifferences are. The key to understanding these devices is to realize that they operate in dif- ferent layers, as illustrated in Fig.4-45(a). The layer matters because different devices use different pieces of information to decide how to switch. In a typical scenario, the user generates some data tobesent toa remote machine. Those data are passed to the transport layer, which then adds a header (for example, a TCP header) and passes the resulting unit down to the network layer. The network layer adds its own header to form a network layer packet (e.g., an IP packet). In Fig.4-45(b), we see the IP packet shaded in gray', 'Then the packet goes to the data link layer, which adds its own header and checksum (CRC) and gives the re- sultingframe tothephysicallayer fortransmission, forexample, overaLAN.

(a)Whichdeviceisinwhichlayer.(b)Frames,packets,and headers. Now let us look at the switching devices and see how they relate to the pack- ets and frames. At the bottom, in the physical layer, we find the repeaters. These are analog devices that work with signals on the cables to which they are con- nected. A signal appearing on one cable is cleaned up, amplified, and put out on another cable. Repeaters donotunderstandframes, packets, orheaders. They un- derstand the symbols that encode bitsas volts. Classic Ethernet, forexample, was SEC. 4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 341 designed to allow four repeaters that would boost the signal to extend the maxi- mumcable lengthfrom500meters to2500meters. Next we come to the hubs. A hub has a number of input lines that it joins electrically. Frames arriving on any of the lines are sent out on all the others. If two frames arrive at the same time, they will collide, just as on a coaxial cable. All the lines coming into a hub must operate at the same speed. Hubs differ from repeaters in that they do not (usually) amplify the incoming signals and are de- signed for multiple input lines, butthe differences are slight. Like repeaters, hubs are physicallayer devices thatdonotexamine thelinklayer addresses oruse them inanyway. Now let us move up to the data link layer, where we find bridges and switch- es. We just studied bridges at some length. A bridge connects two or more LANs. Like a hub,amodern bridge has multipleports, usually enoughfor4to48 input lines of a certain type. Unlike in a hub, each port is isolated to be its own collision domain; if the port has a full-duplex point-to-point line, the CSMA/CD algorithm is not needed. When a frame arrives, the bridge extracts the destination address from the frame header and looks it up in a table to see where to send the frame. For Ethernet, this address is the 48-bit destination address shown in Fig.4-14. The bridge only outputs the frame on the port where it is needed and can forward multipleframes atthesame time. Bridges offer much better performance than hubs, and the isolation between bridge ports also means that the input lines may run at different speeds, possibly even with different network types. A common example is a bridge with ports that connect to 10-, 100-, and 1000-Mbps Ethernet. Buffering within the bridge is needed to accept a frame on one port and transmit the frame out on a different port. If frames come in faster than they can be retransmitted, the bridge may run out of buffer space and have to start discarding frames. For example, if a gigabit Ethernet is pouringbits into a 10-Mbps Ethernet at top speed, the bridge willhave to buffer them, hoping not to run out of memory', 'This problem still exists even if all the ports run at the same speed because more than one port may be sending frames toagivendestination port. Bridges were originally intended to be able to join different kinds of LANs, for example, an Ethernet and a Token Ring LAN. However, this never worked well because of differences between the LANs. Different frame formats require copying and reformatting,which takes CPU time, requires anew checksum calcu- lation, and introduces the possibility of undetected errors due to bad bits in the bridge’s memory. Different maximum frame lengths are also a serious problem with no good solution. Basically, frames that are too large to be forwarded must bediscarded. Somuchfortransparency. Two other areas where LANs can differ are security and quality of service. Some LANs have link-layer encryption, for example 802.11, and some donot, for example Ethernet. Some LANs have quality of service features such as priorities, for example 802.11, and some do not, for example Ethernet. Consequently, when 342 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 aframe musttravel between these LANs, the security orqualityofservice expect- ed by the sender may not be able to be provided. For all of these reasons, modern bridges usually work for one network type, and routers, which we will come to soon,are usedinstead tojoinnetworks ofdifferent types. Switches are modern bridges by another name. The differences are more to dowith marketing than technical issues, butthere are afew pointsworthknowing. Bridges were developed when classic Ethernet was inuse, so they tend to join rel- atively few LANs and thus have relatively few ports. The term ‘‘switch’’ is more popular nowadays. Also, modern installations all use point-to-point links, such as twisted-pair cables, so individual computers plug directly into a switch and thus the switch will tend to have many ports. Finally, ‘‘switch’’ is also used as a gen- eral term. With a bridge, the functionality is clear. On the other hand, a switch may refer to an Ethernet switch or a completely different kind of device that makes forwarding decisions, suchasatelephoneswitch. So far, we have seen repeaters and hubs, which are actually quite similar, as well as bridges and switches, which are even more similar toeachother. Nowwe move up to routers, which are different from all of the above. When a packet comes intoarouter, theframe header andtrailer are stripped offandthepacket lo- cated in the frame’s payload field (shaded in Fig. 4-45) is passed to the routing software. This software uses the packet header to choose an output line. For an IP packet, the packet header willcontain a32-bit (IPv4) or128-bit(IPv6) address, but not a 48-bit IEEE 802 address. The routing software does not see the frame addresses and does not even know whether the packet came in on a LAN or a point-to-point line. We willstudyrouters androutinginChap. 5. Up another layer, we find transport gateways. These connect two computers that use different connection-orientedtransport protocols. For example, supposea computer using the connection-oriented TCP/IP protocol needs to talk to a com- puter using a different connection-oriented transport protocol called SCTP', 'The transport gateway can copy the packets from one connection to the other, refor- mattingthemasneed be. Finally, application gateways understand the format and contents of the data and can translate messages from one format to another. An email gateway could translate Internet messages into SMS messages for mobile phones, for example. Like ‘‘switch,’’ ‘‘gateway’’ is somewhat of a general term. It refers to a for- warding process thatrunsatahighlayer. 4.8.5 Virtual LANs Inthe early days of local area networking, thick yellow cables snaked through the cable ducts of many office buildings. Every computer they passed was plugged in. No thought was given to which computer belonged on which LAN. All the people in adjacent offices were put on the same LAN, whether they be- longedtogether ornot. Geographytrumped corporate organization charts. SEC. 4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 343 With the advent of twisted pair and hubs in the 1990s, all that changed. Buildings were rewired (at considerable expense) to rip out all the yellow garden hoses and install twisted pairs from every office to central wiring closets at the end of each corridor or in a central machine room, as illustrated in Fig. 4-46. If the Vice President in Charge of Wiring was a visionary, Category 5 twisted pairs were installed; if he was a bean counter, the existing (Category 3) telephone wir- ingwas used(onlytobereplacedafew years later, whenfast Ethernet emerged). Cable duct Hub Corridor Switch Hub Twistedpair Office toahub Figure4-46. Abuildingwithcentralizedwiringusinghubsandaswitch. Today, the cables have changed and hubs have become switches, but the wir- ing pattern is still the same. This pattern makes it possible to configure LANs logically rather than physically. For example, if a company wants k LANs, it could buy k switches. By carefully choosing which connectors to plug into which switches, the occupants of a LAN can be chosen in a way that makes organiza- tional sense, withouttoomuchregard togeography. Does it matter who is on which LAN? After all, in nearly all organizations, all the LANsare interconnected. Inshort,yes,itoften matters. Network adminis- trators like to group users on LANs to reflect the organizational structure rather than the physical layout of the building, for a variety of reasons. One issue is se- curity. OneLANmighthostWeb servers andother computers intended forpublic use. Another LAN might host computers containing the records ofthe Human Re- sources department that are not to be passed outside of the department. In such a situation, putting all the computers ona single LAN and notlettinganyofthe ser- vers be accessed from off the LAN makes sense. Management tends to frown whenhearing thatsuchanarrangement isimpossible. 344 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 A second issue is load. Some LANs are more heavily used than others and it may be desirable to separate them. For example, if the folks in research are run- ning all kinds of nifty experiments that sometimes get out of hand and saturate their LAN, the folks in management may not be enthusiastic about donating some of the capacity they were using for videoconferencing to help out. Then again, thismightimpress onmanagement theneed toinstall afaster network. A third issue is broadcast traffic', 'Bridges broadcast traffic when the location of the destination is unknown, and upper-layer protocols use broadcasting as well. For example, when a user wants to send a packet to an IP address x, how does it know which MAC address to put in the frame? We will study this question in Chap. 5, but briefly summarized, the answer is that it broadcasts a frame con- taining the question ‘‘who owns IP address x?’’ Then it waits for an answer. As thenumber ofcomputers inaLAN grows,sodoesthenumber ofbroadcasts. Each broadcast consumes more of the LAN capacity than a regular frame because it is delivered to every computer on the LAN. By keeping LANs no larger than they need tobe,theimpact ofbroadcast traffic isreduced. Related to broadcasts is the problem that once in a while a network interface will break down or be misconfigured and begin generating an endless stream of broadcast frames. Ifthe network isreally unlucky, some ofthese frames willelicit responses that lead toever more traffic. The result of this broadcast storm is that (1) the entire LAN capacity is occupied by these frames, and (2) all the machines on all the interconnected LANs are crippled just processing and discarding all the frames beingbroadcast. At first it might appear that broadcast storms could be limited in scope by separating the LANs with bridges or switches, but if the goal is to achieve tran- sparency (i.e., amachine can be moved toadifferent LAN across the bridge with- outanyonenoticing it),thenbridges havetoforward broadcast frames. Having seen why companies might want multiple LANs with restricted scopes, let us get back to the problem of decoupling the logical topology from the physical topology. Building a physical topology to reflect the organizational structure can add work and cost, even with centralized wiring and switches. For example, if two people in the same department work in different buildings, it may be easier to wire them to different switches that are part of different LANs. Even ifthisisnotthecase, auser might be shifted within the company from onedepart- ment to another without changing offices, or might change offices without chang- ing departments. This might result in the user being on the wrong LAN until an administrator changes the user’s connector from one switch to another. Fur- thermore, the number of computers that belong to different departments may not be a good match for the number of ports on switches; some departments may be too small and others so big that they require multiple switches. This results in wasted switch portsthatare notused. In many companies, organizational changes occur all the time, meaning that system administrators spend alot oftime pullingoutplugsand pushingthem back SEC. 4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 345 in somewhere else. Also, in some cases, the change cannot be made at all be- cause the twisted pair from the user’s machine is too far from the correct switch (e.g., inthewrongbuilding), ortheavailable switch portsare onthewrongLAN. In response to customer requests for more flexibility, network vendors began working on a way to rewire buildings entirely in software. The resulting concept is called a VLAN (Virtual LAN)', 'It has been standardized by the IEEE 802 committee and is now widely deployed in many organizations. Let us now take a look at it. For additional information about VLANs, see Seifert and Edwards (2008). VLANs are based on VLAN-aware switches. To set up a VLAN-based net- work, the network administrator decides how many VLANs there will be, which computers will be on which VLAN, and what the VLANs will be called. Often the VLANs are (informally) named by colors, since it is then possible to print color diagrams showing the physical layout of the machines, with the members of the red LAN in red, members of the green LAN in green, and so on. In this way, boththephysicalandlogical layoutsare visible inasingle view. As an example, consider the bridged LAN of Fig. 4-47, in which nine of the machines belong to the G (gray) VLAN and five belong to the W (white) VLAN. Machines fromthegray VLAN are spread across twoswitches, including twoma- chines thatconnecttoaswitch viaahub. Graystation Grayand Hub Whiteport G G G W W GW Grayport GW G B1 B2 Whiteport Bridge G G G G W W Whitestation Figure4-47. TwoVLANs,grayandwhite,onabridgedLAN. Tomake the VLANs function correctly, configuration tables have to be set up in the bridges. These tables tell which VLANs are accessible via which ports. When a frame comes in from, say, the gray VLAN, it must be forwarded on all the ports marked with a G. This holds for ordinary (i.e., unicast) traffic for which the bridges have not learned the location of the destination, as well as for multi- cast and broadcast traffic. Note that a port may be labeled with multiple VLAN colors. Asanexample, supposethatoneofthegraystations pluggedintobridge B1in Fig.4-47 sends a frame to a destination that has not been observed beforehand. Bridge B1 will receive the frame and see that it came from a machine on the gray 346 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 VLAN, so it will flood the frame on all ports labeled G (except the incoming port). The frame will be sent to the five other gray stations attached to B1 as well as over the link from B1 to bridge B2. At bridge B2, the frame is similarly for- warded on all ports labeled G. This sends the frame to one further station and the hub (which will transmit the frame to all of its stations). The hub has both labels because it connects to machines from both VLANs. The frame is not sent on other ports without G in the label because the bridge knows that there are no ma- chines onthegrayVLAN thatcan bereachedviathese ports. In our example, the frame is only sent from bridge B1 to bridge B2 because there are machines on the gray VLAN that are connected to B2. Looking at the white VLAN, we can see that the bridge B2 port that connects to bridge B1 is not labeled W. This means that a frame on the white VLAN will not be forwarded from bridge B2 to bridge B1. This behavior is correct because no stations on the white VLAN are connectedtoB1', 'The IEEE802.1QStandard To implement this scheme, bridges need to know to which VLAN an incom- ing frame belongs. Without this information, for example, when bridge B2 gets a frame from bridge B1 in Fig.4-47, it cannot know whether to forward the frame on the gray or white VLAN. If we were designing a new type of LAN, it would be easy enough to just add a VLAN field in the header. But what to do about Ethernet, which is the dominant LAN, and did not have any spare fields lying aroundfortheVLAN identifier? The IEEE 802 committee had this problem thrown into its lap in 1995. After much discussion, it did the unthinkable and changed the Ethernet header. The new format was published in IEEE standard 802.1Q, issued in 1998. The new format contains a VLAN tag; we willexamine it shortly. Notsurprisingly, chang- ing something as well established as the Ethernet header was not entirely trivial. Afew questionsthatcome tomindare: 1. Need wethrowoutseveral hundredmillionexisting Ethernet cards? 2. Ifnot,whogenerates thenewfields? 3. What happens toframes thatare already themaximum size? Of course, the 802 committee was (only too painfully) aware of these problems andhadtocome upwithsolutions, which itdid. The key to the solution is to realize that the VLAN fields are only actually used by the bridges and switches and not by the user machines. Thus, in Fig.4- 47, it is not really essential that they are present on the lines going out to the end stations as long as they are on the line between the bridges. Also, to use VLANs, thebridges have tobeVLAN aware. Thisfact makes thedesignfeasible. SEC. 4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 347 As to throwing out all existing Ethernet cards, the answer is no. Remember that the 802.3 committee could not even get people tochange the Type field intoa Length field. You can imagine the reaction to an announcement that all existing Ethernet cards had to be thrown out. However, new Ethernet cards are 802.1Q compliant andcan correctly fillintheVLAN fields. Because there can be computers (and switches) that are not VLAN aware, the first VLAN-aware bridge to touch a frame adds VLAN fields and the last one down the road removes them. An example of a mixed topology is shown in Fig.4-48. In this figure, VLAN-aware computers generate tagged (i.e., 802.1Q) frames directly, and further switching uses these tags. The shaded symbols are VLAN-aware andtheemptyonesare not. Legacy frame B3 B1 B2 B5 Tagged frame B4 B6 Legacy VLAN-aware bridge hostandbridge andhost Figure4-48. BridgedLANthatisonlypartlyVLANaware. Theshadedsymb- olsareVLANaware.Theemptyonesarenot. With 802.1Q, frames are colored depending on the port on which they are re- ceived. For this method to work, all machines on a port must belong to the same VLAN, which reduces flexibility. For example, in Fig.4-48, this property holds for all ports where an individual computer connects to a bridge, but not for the portwhere thehubconnectstobridge B2. Additionally, the bridge can use the higher-layer protocol to select the color. In this way, frames arriving on a port might be placed in different VLANs de- pendingonwhether theycarry IPpackets orPPPframes. Other methodsare possible, buttheyare notsupportedby802.1Q', 'As oneex- ample, the MAC address can be used to select the VLAN color. This might be useful for frames coming in from a nearby 802.11 LAN in which laptops send frames via different portsas they move. One MAC address wouldthen be mapped toafixed VLAN regardless ofwhichportitentered theLANon. As to the problem of frames longer than 1518 bytes, 802.1Q just raised the limit to 1522 bytes. Luckily, only VLAN-aware computers and switches must supportthese longerframes. Now let us take a look at the 802.1Q frame format. It is shown in Fig.4-49. The only change is the addition of a pair of 2-byte fields. The first one is the 348 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 VLAN protocol ID. It always has the value 0x8100. Since this number is greater than 1500, all Ethernet cards interpret it as a type rather than a length. What a legacy card does with such a frame is moot since such frames are not supposed to besenttolegacy cards.

The802.3(legacy)and802.1QEthernetframeformats. The second 2-byte field contains three subfields. The main one is the VLAN identifier, occupying the low-order 12 bits. This is what the whole thing is about—the color of the VLAN to which the frame belongs. The 3-bit Priority field has nothing to do with VLANs at all, but since changing the Ethernet header is a once-in-a-decade event taking three years and featuring a hundred people, why not put in some other good things while you are at it? This field makes it possible to distinguish hard real-time traffic from soft real-time traffic from time- insensitive traffic in order to provide better quality of service over Ethernet. It is needed for voice over Ethernet (although in all fairness, IP has had a similar field foraquarter ofacentury andnobodyever usedit). The last field, CFI (Canonical format indicator), should have been called the CEI (Corporate ego indicator). It was originally intended to indicate the order of the bits in the MAC addresses (little-endian versus big-endian), but that use got lost in other controversies. Its presence now indicates that the payload contains a freeze-dried 802.5 frame that is hoping to find another 802.5 LAN at the destina- tion while being carried by Ethernet in between. This whole arrangement, of course, has nothing whatsoever to do with VLANs. But standards’ committee politics are not unlike regular politics: if you vote for my bit, I will vote for your bit. As we mentioned above, when a tagged frame arrives at a VLAN-aware switch, the switch uses the VLAN identifier as an index into a table to find out which ports to send it on. But where does the table come from? If it is manually constructed, we are back to square zero: manual configuration of bridges. The beauty ofthetransparent bridge isthatitisplug-and-play anddoesnotrequire any manual configuration. It would be a terrible shame to lose that property', 'For- tunately, VLAN-aware bridges can also autoconfigure themselves based on observing the tags that come by. If a frame tagged as VLAN 4 comes in on port SEC. 4.8 DATALINKLAYERSWITCHING 349 3, apparently some machine on port 3 is on VLAN 4. The 802.1Q standard ex- plains how to build the tables dynamically,mostly byreferencing appropriate por- tionsofthe802.1Dstandard. Before leaving the subject of VLAN routing, it is worth making one last observation. Many people in the Internet and Ethernet worlds are fanatically in favor of connectionless networking and violently opposed to anything smacking of connections in the data link or network layers. Yet VLANs introduce some- thing that is surprisingly similar to a connection. To use VLANs properly, each frame carries a new special identifier that is used as an index into a table inside the switch to look up where the frame is supposed to be sent. That is precisely what happens in connection-oriented networks. In connectionless networks, it is the destination address that is used for routing, not some kind of connection iden- tifier. Wewillsee moreofthiscreeping connectionisminChap. 5. 4.9 SUMMARY Some networks have a single channel that is used for all communication. In these networks, the key design issue is the allocation of this channel among the competing stations wishing to use it. FDM and TDM are simple, efficient alloca- tion schemes when the number ofstations issmall andfixed andthe traffic iscon- tinuous. Both are widely used under these circumstances, for example, for divid- ing up the bandwidth ontelephone trunks. However, when the number of stations is large and variable or the traffic is fairly bursty—the common case in computer networks—FDM andTDMare poorchoices. Numerous dynamic channel allocation algorithms have been devised. The ALOHA protocol, with and without slotting, is used in many derivatives in real systems, for example, cable modems and RFID. As an improvement when the state of the channel can besensed, stations can avoid starting a transmission while another station is transmitting. This technique, carrier sensing, has led to a variety of CSMA protocols for LANs and MANs. It is the basis for classic Ethernet and 802.11networks. Aclass ofprotocols that eliminates contention altogether, orat least reduces it considerably, is well known. The bitmap protocol, topologies such as rings, and the binary countdown protocol completely eliminate contention. The tree walk protocol reduces itbydynamicallydividingthestations intotwodisjointgroupsof different sizes and allowing contention only within one group; ideally that group ischosen sothatonlyonestation isready tosendwhenitispermittedtodoso. Wireless LANs have the added problems that it is difficult to sense colliding transmissions, and that the coverage regions of stations may differ. In the dom- inant wireless LAN, IEEE 802.11, stations use CSMA/CA to mitigate the first problem by leaving small gaps to avoid collisions. The stations can also use the RTS/CTS protocol to combat hidden terminals that arise because of the second 350 THEMEDIUMACCESSCONTROLSUBLAYER CHAP. 4 problem. IEEE 802.11 is commonly used to connect laptops and other devices to wireless access points, but it can also be used between devices. Any of several physical layers can be used, including multichannel FDM with and without multi- pleantennas, andspread spectrum', 'Like 802.11,RFIDreaders andtagsuse a randomaccessprotocol tocommun- icate identifiers. Other wireless PANs and MANs have different designs. The Bluetooth system connects headsets and many kinds of peripherals to computers without wires. IEEE 802.16 provides a wide area wireless Internet data service for stationary and mobile computers. Both of these networks use a centralized, connection-oriented design in which the Bluetooth master and the WiMAX base station decide when each station may send or receive data. For 802.16, this design supports different quality of service for real-time traffic like telephone calls and interactive traffic like Web browsing. For Bluetooth, placing the complexity in themaster leads toinexpensive slave devices. Ethernet is the dominant form of wired LAN. Classic Ethernet used CSMA/CD for channel allocation on a yellow cable the size of a garden hose that snaked from machine to machine. The architecture has changed as speeds have risen from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps and continue to climb. Now, point-to-point links such as twisted pair are attached to hubs and switches. With modern switches and full-duplex links, there is no contention on the links and the switch can forward frames between different portsinparallel. With buildings full of LANs, a way is needed to interconnect them all. Plug- and-play bridges are used for this purpose. The bridges are built with a backward learning algorithm and a spanning tree algorithm. Since this functionality is built into modern switches, the terms ‘‘bridge’’ and ‘‘switch’’ are used interchangeably. To help with the management of bridged LANs, VLANs let the physical topology be divided into different logical topologies. The VLAN standard, IEEE 802.1Q, introducesanewformat forEthernet frames. PROBLEMS 1. For this problem, use a formula from this chapter, but first state the formula. Frames arrive randomly ata100-Mbpschannel for transmission.

All frames are themaximumlengthallowed. 5 THE NETWORK LAYER The network layer is concerned with getting packets from the source all the way to the destination. Getting to the destination may require making many hops at intermediate routers along the way. This function clearly contrasts with that of the data link layer, which has the more modest goal of just moving frames from one end of a wire to the other. Thus, the network layer is the lowest layer that deals withend-to-end transmission. To achieve its goals, the network layer must know about the topology of the network (i.e., the set ofall routers andlinks)andchooseappropriate pathsthrough it, even for large networks. It must also take care when choosing routes to avoid overloading some of the communication lines and routers while leaving others idle. Finally, when the source and destination are in different networks, new problems occur. It is up to the network layer to deal with them. In this chapter we will study all these issues and illustrate them, primarily using the Internet and itsnetwork layer protocol, IP. 5.1 NETWORK LAYER DESIGN ISSUES In the following sections, we will give an introduction to some of the issues that the designers of the network layer must grapple with. These issues include theservice providedtothetransport layer andtheinternal designofthenetwork. 355 356 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP', '5 5.1.1 Store-and-Forward Packet Switching Before starting toexplain the details of the network layer, it is worth restating the context in which the network layer protocols operate. This context can be seen in Fig.5-1. The major components of the network are the ISP’s equipment (routers connected by transmission lines), shown inside the shaded oval, and the customers’ equipment, shown outside the oval. Host H1 is directly connected to one of the ISP’s routers, A, perhaps as a home computer that is plugged into a DSL modem. In contrast, H2 is on a LAN, which might be an office Ethernet, with a router, F, owned and operated by the customer. This router has a leased line to the ISP’s equipment. We have shown F as being outside the oval because it does not belong to the ISP. For the purposes of this chapter, however, routers oncustomer premises are considered part of the ISP network because they run the same algorithms astheISP’s routers (andourmainconcern here isalgorithms). Router ISP’sequipment ProcessP1 P2 B D A E F HostH1 LAN H2 C Packet Figure5-1. Theenvironmentofthenetworklayerprotocols. Thisequipment isusedasfollows. Ahostwithapacket tosend transmits it to the nearest router, either on its own LAN or over a point-to-point link to the ISP. The packet is stored there until it has fully arrived and the link has finished its processing by verifying the checksum. Then it is forwarded to the next router along the path until it reaches the destination host, where it is delivered. This mechanism is store-and-forward packet switching, as we have seen in previous chapters. 5.1.2 Services Provided to the Transport Layer The network layer provides services to the transport layer at the network layer/transport layer interface. An important question is precisely what kind of services the network layer provides tothe transport layer. The services need tobe carefully designed withthefollowing goalsinmind: SEC. 5.1 NETWORK LAYERDESIGNISSUES 357 1. The services shouldbeindependent oftherouter technology. 2. The transport layer should be shielded from the number, type, and topologyoftherouters present. 3. The network addresses made available to the transport layer should useauniformnumbering plan,even across LANsandWANs. Given these goals, the designers of the network layer have a lot of freedom in writing detailed specifications of the services to be offered to the transport layer. This freedom often degenerates into a raging battle between two warring factions. The discussion centers on whether the network layer should provide connection- oriented service orconnectionlessservice. One camp (represented by the Internet community) argues that the routers’ job is moving packets around and nothing else. In this view (based on40years of experience with areal computer network), the network isinherently unreliable, no matter how it is designed. Therefore, the hosts should accept this fact and do errorcontrol (i.e., errordetection andcorrection) andflowcontrol themselves. Thisviewpoint leads totheconclusion that the network service shouldbecon- nectionless, with primitivesSEND PACKET andRECEIVE PACKET and little else. In particular, no packet ordering and flow control should be done, because the hosts are going to do that anyway and there is usually little to be gained by doing it twice', 'This reasoning is an example of the end-to-end argument, a design principle that has been very influential in shaping the Internet (Saltzer et al., 1984). Furthermore, each packet must carry the full destination address, because eachpacket sentiscarried independently ofitspredecessors,ifany. The other camp (represented by the telephone companies) argues that the net- work should provide a reliable, connection-oriented service. They claim that 100 years of successful experience with the worldwide telephone system is an excel- lent guide. In this view, quality of service is the dominant factor, and without connections in the network, quality of service is very difficult to achieve, espe- cially forreal-time traffic suchasvoice andvideo. Even after several decades, this controversy is still very much alive. Early, widely used data networks, such as X.25 in the 1970s and its successor Frame Relay in the 1980s, were connection-oriented. However, since the days of the ARPANET and the early Internet, connectionless network layers have grown tremendouslyinpopularity.TheIPprotocol isnowanever-present symbol ofsuc- cess. It was undeterred by a connection-oriented technology called ATM that was developed to overthrow it in the 1980s; instead, it is ATM that is now found in niche uses and IP that is taking over telephone networks. Under the covers, how- ever, theInternet isevolving connection-orientedfeatures as qualityofservice be- comes more important. Two examples of connection-oriented technologies are MPLS (MultiProtocol Label Switching), which we will describe in this chapter, andVLANs, whichwesaw inChap. 4. Bothtechnologiesare widely used. 358 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 5.1.3 Implementation of Connectionless Service Having looked at the two classes of service the network layer can provide to itsusers, it istime tosee howthislayer worksinside. Twodifferent organizations are possible, depending onthetype ofservice offered. Ifconnectionlessservice is offered, packets are injected into the network individually and routed indepen- dently of each other. No advance setup is needed. In this context, the packets are frequently called datagrams (in analogy with telegrams) and the network is call- ed a datagram network. If connection-oriented service is used, a path from the source router all the way to the destination router must be established before any data packets can be sent. This connection is called a VC (virtual circuit), in an- alogy with the physical circuits set upby the telephonesystem, and the network is called a virtual-circuit network. In this section, we will examine datagram net- works;inthenextone,wewillexamine virtual-circuit networks. Let us now see how a datagram network works. Suppose that the process P1 in Fig.5-2 has a long message for P2. It hands the message to the transport layer, with instructions to deliver it to process P2 on host H2. The transport layer code runs on H1, typically within the operating system. It prepends a transport header tothe frontofthe message andhands the result tothe network layer, probably just another procedure withintheoperating system', 'Router ISP’sequipment ProcessP1 P2 B D 4 1 A E F 3 2 HostH1 LAN H2 C Packet A’stable(initially) A’stable(later) C’stable E’stable A – A – A A A C B B B B B A B D C C C C C – C C D B D B D E D D E C E B E E E – F C F B F E F F Dest. Line Figure5-2. Routingwithinadatagramnetwork. Let us assume for this example that the message is four times longer than the maximum packet size, so the network layer has to break it into four packets, 1, 2, SEC. 5.1 NETWORK LAYERDESIGNISSUES 359 3, and 4, and send each of them in turn to router A using some point-to-point pro- tocol, for example, PPP. At this point the ISP takes over. Every router has an in- ternal table telling it where to send packets for each of the possible destinations. Each table entry is a pair consisting of a destination and the outgoing line to use for that destination. Only directly connected lines can be used. For example, in Fig.5-2, Ahasonlytwooutgoinglines—to BandtoC—soevery incoming packet must be sent to one of these routers, even if the ultimate destination is to some other router. A’s initial routing table is shown in the figure under the label ‘‘ini- tially.’’ At A, packets 1, 2, and 3 are stored briefly, having arrived on the incoming link and had their checksums verified. Then each packet is forwarded according to A’s table, onto the outgoing link to C within a new frame. Packet 1 is then for- warded to E and then to F. When it gets to F, it is sent within a frame over the LAN toH2.Packets 2and3follow thesame route. However, something different happens to packet 4. When it gets to A it is sent to router B, even thoughit is also destined forF. Forsome reason, A decided tosendpacket 4viaadifferent route thanthatofthefirst three packets. Perhaps it has learned of a traffic jam somewhere along the ACE path and updated its rout- ingtable, as shown under the label ‘‘later.’’ The algorithm that manages the tables and makes the routing decisions is called the routing algorithm. Routing algo- rithms are one of the main topics we will study in this chapter. There are several different kindsofthem, aswewillsee. IP (Internet Protocol), which is the basis for the entire Internet, is the dom- inant example of a connectionless network service. Each packet carries adestina- tion IPaddress that routers use toindividually forward eachpacket. The addresses are 32 bits in IPv4 packets and 128 bits in IPv6 packets. We will describe IP in muchdetail later inthischapter. 5.1.4 Implementation of Connection-Oriented Service For connection-orientedservice, we need a virtual-circuit network. Let ussee how that works. The idea behind virtual circuits is to avoid having to choose a new route for every packet sent, as in Fig.5-2. Instead, when a connection is es- tablished, a route from the source machine to the destination machine ischosen as part of the connection setup and stored in tables inside the routers', 'That route is used for all traffic flowing over the connection, exactly the same way that the telephone system works. When the connection is released, the virtual circuit is also terminated. With connection-oriented service, each packet carries an identi- fier tellingwhichvirtual circuit itbelongsto. As an example, consider the situation shown in Fig.5-3. Here, host H1 has established connection1withhostH2. Thisconnectionisremembered asthefirst entry in each of the routing tables. The first line of A’s table says that if a packet 360 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 bearing connection identifier 1 comes in from H1, it is to be sent to router C and givenconnectionidentifier 1. Similarly, thefirst entry at Croutes the packet toE, alsowithconnectionidentifier 1.

Routingwithinavirtual-circuitnetwork. Now let us consider what happens if H3 also wants to establish a connection to H2. It chooses connection identifier 1 (because it is initiating the connection andthisisitsonlyconnection)andtells thenetwork toestablish the virtual circuit. This leads to the second row in the tables. Note that we have a conflict here be- cause although A can easily distinguish connection 1 packets from H1 from con- nection 1packets fromH3,Ccannotdothis. Forthisreason, Aassigns adifferent connection identifier to the outgoing traffic for the second connection. Avoiding conflicts of this kind is why routers need the ability to replace connection identi- fiers inoutgoingpackets. In some contexts, this process is called label switching. An example of a connection-oriented network service is MPLS (MultiProtocol Label Switching). It is used within ISP networks in the Internet, with IP packets wrapped in an MPLS header having a 20-bit connection identifier or label. MPLS is often hid- den from customers, with the ISP establishing long-term connections for large amountsoftraffic, butit isincreasingly being used tohelpwhenqualityofservice isimportant butalso with other ISP traffic management tasks. We willhave more tosayaboutMPLS later inthischapter. SEC. 5.1 NETWORK LAYERDESIGNISSUES 361 5.1.5 Comparison of Virtual-Circuit and Datagram Networks Both virtual circuits and datagrams have their supporters and their detractors. We will now attempt to summarize both sets of arguments. The major issues are listed in Fig.5-4, although purists could probably find a counterexample for everything inthefigure.

Comparisonofdatagramandvirtual-circuitnetworks. Inside the network, several trade-offs exist between virtual circuits and data- grams. One trade-off is setup time versus address parsing time. Using virtual cir- cuits requires a setup phase, which takes time and consumes resources. However, once this price is paid, figuring out what to do with a data packet in a virtual-cir- cuit network iseasy: the router justuses the circuit number to index into a table to find out where the packet goes', 'In a datagram network, no setup is needed but a more complicated lookup procedure is required to locate the entry for the destina- tion. Arelated issue isthat the destination addresses used indatagram networks are longer than circuit numbers used in virtual-circuit networks because they have a global meaning. If the packets tend to be fairly short, including a full destination address in every packet may represent a significant amount of overhead, and hence awaste ofbandwidth. Yet another issue is the amount of table space required in router memory. A datagram network needs tohave anentry forevery possible destination, whereas a virtual-circuit network just needs an entry for each virtual circuit. However, this 362 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 advantage is somewhat illusory since connection setup packets have to be routed too,andtheyusedestination addresses, thesame asdatagrams do. Virtual circuits have some advantages in guaranteeing quality of service and avoiding congestion within the network because resources (e.g., buffers, band- width, and CPU cycles) can be reserved inadvance, when the connection is estab- lished. Once the packets start arriving, the necessary bandwidth and router capac- ity will be there. With a datagram network, congestion avoidance is more diffi- cult. For transaction processing systems (e.g., stores calling upto verify credit card purchases), the overhead required to set up and clear a virtual circuit may easily dwarf the use of the circuit. If the majority of the traffic is expected to be of this kind,the use ofvirtual circuits inside the network makes littlesense. Ontheother hand, for long-running uses such as VPN traffic between two corporate offices, permanent virtual circuits (that are set up manually and last for months or years) maybeuseful. Virtual circuits also have a vulnerability problem. If a router crashes and loses its memory, even if it comes back up a second later, all the virtual circuits passing through it will have to be aborted. In contrast, if a datagram router goes down, only those users whose packets were queued in the router at the time need suffer (and probably not even then since the sender is likely to retransmit them shortly). The loss of a communication line is fatal to virtual circuits using it, but can easily be compensated for if datagrams are used. Datagrams also allow the routers to balance the traffic throughout the network, since routes can be changed partway throughalongsequence ofpacket transmissions. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS The mainfunction ofthe network layer isrouting packets fromthe source ma- chine to the destination machine. In most networks, packets will require multiple hops to make the journey. The only notable exception is for broadcast networks, but even here routing is an issue if the source and destination are not on the same network segment. The algorithms that choose the routes and the data structures thattheyuseare amajor area ofnetwork layer design. The routing algorithm is that part of the network layer software responsible for deciding which output line an incoming packet should be transmitted on', 'If the network uses datagrams internally, this decision must be made anew for every arriving data packet since the best route may have changed since last time. If the network uses virtual circuits internally, routing decisions are made only when a new virtual circuit isbeing set up. Thereafter, data packets justfollow thealready established route. The latter case is sometimes called session routing because a route remains inforce foranentire session (e.g., while loggedinoveraVPN). SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 363 It is sometimes useful tomake a distinction between routing, which is making the decision which routes to use, and forwarding, which is what happens when a packet arrives. One can think of a router as having two processes inside it. One of them handles each packet as it arrives, lookingupthe outgoingline touse forit in the routing tables. This process is forwarding. The other process is responsi- ble for filling in and updating the routing tables. That is where the routing algo- rithmcomes intoplay. Regardless ofwhether routes are chosen independently foreachpacket sent or only when new connections are established, certain properties are desirable in a routing algorithm: correctness, simplicity, robustness, stability, fairness, and effi- ciency. Correctness and simplicity hardly require comment, but the need for robustnessmaybeless obviousat first. Once a major network comes onthe air, it may beexpected toruncontinuouslyforyears withoutsystem-wide failures. Dur- ing that period there will be hardware and software failures of all kinds. Hosts, routers, and lines will fail repeatedly, and the topology will change many times. The routing algorithm should be able to cope with changes in the topology and traffic without requiring all jobs in all hosts to be aborted. Imagine the havoc if thenetwork needed toberebootedevery timesomerouter crashed! Stability is also an important goal for the routing algorithm. There exist rout- ingalgorithms thatnever convergetoafixed setofpaths, nomatter howlongthey run. A stable algorithm reaches equilibrium and stays there. It should converge quickly too, since communication may be disrupted until the routing algorithm hasreachedequilibrium. Fairness and efficiency may sound obvious—surely no reasonable person would oppose them—but as it turns out, they are often contradictory goals. As a simple example of this conflict, look at Fig.5-5. Suppose that there is enough traffic between A and A′, between B and B′, and between CandC′tosaturate the horizontal links. To maximize the total flow, the X toX′ traffic shouldbe shut off altogether. Unfortunately, X and X′ may not see it that way. Evidently, some compromise between global efficiency and fairness to individual connections is needed. Before wecan even attempt tofindtrade-offs between fairness and efficiency, we mustdecide whatitisweseek tooptimize. Minimizing themean packet delay is an obvious candidate to send traffic through the network effectively, but so is maximizing total network throughput. Furthermore, these two goals are also in conflict, since operating any queueing system near capacity implies a long queue- ing delay. As a compromise, many networks attempt to minimize the distance a packet must travel, or simply reduce the number of hops a packet must make', \"Ei- ther choice tends to improve the delay and also reduce the amount of bandwidth consumed per packet, which tends to improve the overall network throughput as well. Routing algorithms can be grouped into two major classes: nonadaptive and adaptive. Nonadaptive algorithms do not base their routing decisions on any 364 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 A B C X X′ A' B' C' Figure5-5. Networkwithaconflictbetweenfairnessandefficiency. measurements or estimates of the current topologyand traffic. Instead, the choice of the route to use to get from I to J (for all I and J) is computed in advance, off- line, and downloaded to the routers when the network is booted. This procedure is sometimes called static routing. Because it does not respond to failures, static routing ismostly useful forsituations inwhich the routing choice isclear. For ex- ample, router F in Fig.5-3 should send packets headed into the network to router Eregardless oftheultimatedestination. Adaptive algorithms, in contrast, change their routing decisions to reflect changes in the topology, and sometimes changes in the traffic as well. These dynamic routing algorithms differ in where they get their information (e.g., locally, from adjacent routers, or from all routers), when they change the routes (e.g., when the topology changes, or every ΔT seconds as the load changes), and what metric is used for optimization (e.g., distance, number of hops, or estimated transit time). In the following sections, we will discuss a variety of routing algorithms. The algorithms cover delivery models besides sending a packet from a source to a destination. Sometimes the goal is to send the packet to multiple, all, or one of a set of destinations. All of the routing algorithms we describe here make decisions based on the topology; we defer the possibility of decisions based on the traffic levels toSec 5.3. 5.2.1 The Optimality Principle Before we get into specific algorithms, it may be helpful to note that one can make a general statement about optimal routes without regard to network topo- logy or traffic. This statement is known as the optimality principle (Bellman, 1957). It states that if router J is on the optimal path from router I to router K, SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 365 then the optimal path from J to K also falls alongthe same route. To see this, call the part of the route from I to J r and the rest of the route r . If a route better 1 2 than r existed from J to K, it could be concatenated with r to improve the route 2 1 fromItoK,contradicting ourstatement thatr r isoptimal. 1 2 As a direct consequence of the optimality principle, we can see that the set of optimal routes from all sources to a given destination form a tree rooted at the destination. Such a tree is called a sink tree and is illustrated in Fig. 5-6(b), where the distance metric is the number of hops. The goal of all routing algo- rithms istodiscover andusethesinktrees forallrouters\", 'B B A A C C D E D E G J G J F F I I H N H N L L K K M O M O (a) (b) Figure5-6. (a)Anetwork.(b)AsinktreeforrouterB. Note that a sink tree is not necessarily unique; other trees with the same path lengths may exist. If we allow all of the possible paths to be chosen, the tree be- comes a more general structure called a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). DAGs have no loops. We will use sink trees as a convenient shorthand for both cases. Both cases also depend on the technical assumption that the paths do not interfere with each other so, for example, a traffic jam on one path will not cause another pathtodivert. Since a sinktree isindeed a tree, it does notcontain any loops,so each packet will be delivered within a finite and bounded number of hops. In practice, life is notquitethiseasy. Linksandrouters can godownandcome back upduringoper- ation, so different routers may have different ideas about the current topology. Also,we have quietly finessed the issue ofwhether each router has toindividually acquire the information on which to base its sink tree computation or whether this information is collected by some other means. We will come back to these issues shortly. Nevertheless, the optimality principle and the sink tree provide a bench- mark against which otherroutingalgorithms can bemeasured. 366 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 5.2.2 Shortest Path Algorithm Let us begin our studyof routing algorithms with a simple technique for com- puting optimal paths given a complete picture of the network. These paths are the ones that we want a distributed routing algorithm tofind, even thoughnotall rout- ersmayknowallofthedetails ofthenetwork. The idea is to build a graph of the network, with each node of the graph representing a router and each edge of the graph representing a communication line, or link. To choose a route between a given pair of routers, the algorithm just findstheshortest pathbetween themonthegraph. The concept of a shortest path deserves some explanation. One way of measuring path length is the number of hops. Using this metric, the paths ABC and ABE in Fig.5-7 are equally long. Another metric is the geographic distance in kilometers, in which case ABC is clearly much longer than ABE (assuming the figure isdrawn toscale).

ThefirstsixstepsusedincomputingtheshortestpathfromAtoD. Thearrowsindicatetheworkingnode. SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 367 However, many other metrics besides hopsandphysicaldistance are also pos- sible. For example, each edge could be labeled with the mean delay of a standard test packet, as measured by hourly runs. With this graph labeling, the shortest pathisthefastest pathrather thanthepathwiththefewest edges orkilometers', 'Inthegeneral case, thelabels onthe edges could becomputed as afunction of the distance, bandwidth, average traffic, communication cost, measured delay, and other factors. By changing the weighting function, the algorithm would then compute the ‘‘shortest’’ path measured according to any one of a number of cri- teria ortoacombination ofcriteria. Several algorithms for computing the shortest path between two nodes of a graph are known. This one is due to Dijkstra (1959) and finds the shortest paths between a source and all destinations in the network. Each node is labeled (in parentheses) with its distance from the source node along the best known path. The distances mustbenon-negative,astheywillbeiftheyare based onreal quan- tities like bandwidth and delay. Initially, no paths are known, so all nodes are labeled with infinity. As the algorithm proceeds and paths are found, the labels may change, reflecting better paths. Alabel may beeither tentative orpermanent. Initially, all labels are tentative. When it is discovered that a label represents the shortest possible path from the source to that node, it is made permanent and never changed thereafter. To illustrate how the labeling algorithm works, look at the weighted, undirected graph of Fig. 5-7(a), where the weights represent, for example, dis- tance. We want to find the shortest path from A to D. We start out by marking node A as permanent, indicated by a filled-in circle. Then we examine, in turn, each of the nodes adjacent to A (the working node), relabeling each one with the distance to A. Whenever a node is relabeled, we also label it with the node from which the probe was made so that we can reconstruct the final path later. If the network had more than one shortest path from A toD and we wanted tofindall of them, we would need to remember all of the probe nodes that could reach a node withthesame distance. Having examined each of the nodes adjacent to A, we examine all the tenta- tively labeled nodes in the whole graph and make the one with the smallest label permanent, asshowninFig.5-7(b). Thisonebecomes thenewworkingnode. We nowstart atBandexamine allnodesadjacenttoit. Ifthe sumofthe label onB andthe distance from Btothe nodebeing considered isless than thelabel on thatnode,wehave ashorter path,sothenodeisrelabeled. After all the nodes adjacent to the working node have been inspected and the tentative labels changed if possible, the entire graph is searched forthe tentatively labeled node with the smallest value. This node is made permanent and becomes the working nodeforthe next round. Figure 5-7showsthe firstsixstepsoftheal- gorithm. To see why the algorithm works, look at Fig.5-7(c). At this point we have just made E permanent. Suppose that there were a shorter path than ABE, say 368 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 AXYZE (for some X and Y). There are two possibilities: either node Z has already been made permanent, orithasnotbeen. Ifithas,thenEhasalready been probed (ontheroundfollowing the onewhen Zwas made permanent), sothe AXYZE path hasnotescaped ourattention andthuscannotbeashorter path. Now consider the case where Z is still tentatively labeled', 'If the label at Z is greater than or equal to that at E, then AXYZE cannot be a shorter path than ABE. Ifthe label isless than that ofE,then Z andnotEwillbecome permanent first, al- lowingEtobeprobedfromZ. This algorithm is given in Fig.5-8. The global variables n and dist describe the graph and are initialized before shortest path is called. The only difference between the program and the algorithm described above is that in Fig.5-8, we compute the shortest path starting at the terminal node, t, rather than at the source node,s. Since the shortest paths from t to s in an undirected graph are the same as the shortest paths from s to t, it does not matter at which end we begin. The reason for searching backward is that each node is labeled with its predecessor rather than its successor. When the final path is copied into the output variable, path, the path is thus reversed. The two reversal effects cancel, and the answer is pro- duced inthecorrect order. 5.2.3 Flooding When a routing algorithm is implemented, each router must make decisions based on local knowledge, not the complete picture of the network. A simple local technique is flooding, in which every incoming packet is sent out on every outgoinglineexcept theoneitarrived on. Flooding obviously generates vast numbers of duplicate packets, in fact, an infinite number unless some measures are taken to damp the process. One such measure is to have a hop counter contained in the header of each packet that is decremented at each hop, with the packet being discarded when the counter reaches zero. Ideally, the hop counter should be initialized to the length of the path from source todestination. If the sender does notknowhowlongthe path is, it can initialize the counter to the worst case, namely, the full diameter of the net- work. Flooding with a hop count can produce an exponential number of duplicate packets as the hop count grows and routers duplicate packets they have seen be- fore. A better technique for damming the flood is to have routers keep track of which packets have been flooded, to avoid sending them out a second time. One way to achieve this goal is to have the source router put a sequence number in each packet it receives from its hosts. Each router then needs a list per source router telling which sequence numbers originating at that source have already been seen. Ifanincoming packet isonthelist, itisnotflooded.

To prevent the list from growing without bound, each list should be aug- mented by a counter, k, meaning that all sequence numbers through k have been seen', 'When a packet comes in, it is easy to check if the packet has already been 370 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 flooded (by comparing its sequence number to k; if so, it is discarded. Further- more, thefulllistbelow kisnotneeded, since keffectively summarizes it. Flooding is not practical for sending most packets, but it does have some im- portant uses. First, it ensures that a packet is delivered to every node in the net- work. This may be wasteful if there is a single destination that needs the packet, but it is effective for broadcasting information. In wireless networks, all mes- sages transmitted by a station can be received by all other stations within its radio range, whichis,infact, flooding,andsomealgorithms utilizethisproperty. Second,floodingistremendouslyrobust. Even iflarge numbers ofrouters are blown tobits (e.g., ina military network located ina war zone), floodingwillfind a path if one exists, to get a packet to its destination. Flooding also requires little in the way of setup. The routers only need to know their neighbors. This means that flooding can be used as a building block for other routing algorithms that are more efficient but need more in the way of setup. Flooding can also be used as a metric against which other routing algorithms can be compared. Flooding always chooses the shortest path because it chooses every possible path in parallel. Con- sequently, no other algorithm can produce a shorter delay (if we ignore the over- head generated bythefloodingprocess itself). 5.2.4 Distance Vector Routing Computer networks generally use dynamic routing algorithms that are more complex than flooding, but more efficient because they find shortest paths for the current topology. Two dynamic algorithms in particular, distance vector routing and link state routing, are the most popular. In this section, we will look at the former algorithm. Inthefollowing section, wewillstudythelatter algorithm. A distance vector routing algorithm operates byhaving each router maintain a table (i.e., a vector) giving the best known distance to each destination and which link to use to get there. These tables are updated by exchanging infor- mation with the neighbors. Eventually, every router knows the best link to reach eachdestination. The distance vector routing algorithm is sometimes called by other names, most commonly the distributed Bellman-Ford routing algorithm, after the re- searchers who developed it (Bellman, 1957; and Ford and Fulkerson, 1962). It was the original ARPANET routing algorithm and was also used in the Internet underthename RIP. In distance vector routing, each router maintains a routing table indexed by, and containing one entry for each router in the network. This entry has two parts: the preferred outgoing line to use for that destination and an estimate of the dis- tance to that destination. The distance might be measured as the number of hops orusinganother metric, aswediscussed forcomputingshortest paths. The router is assumed to know the ‘‘distance’’ to each of its neighbors. If the metric is hops, the distance is just one hop. If the metric is propagation delay, the SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 371 router can measure it directly with special ECHO packets that the receiver just timestamps andsendsbackasfastasitcan', \"As an example, assume that delay is used as a metric and that the router knowsthe delay toeachofitsneighbors. Once every Tmsec, eachrouter sendsto each neighbor a list of its estimated delays to each destination. It also receives a similar list from each neighbor. Imagine that one of these tables has just come in fromneighborX,withX being X’s estimate of how longit takes to get to router i. i If the router knows that the delay to X is m msec, it also knows that it can reach router i via X in X +m msec. By performing this calculation for each neighbor, a i router can find out which estimate seems the best and use that estimate and the corresponding link in its new routing table. Note that the old routing table is not usedinthecalculation. Thisupdatingprocess isillustratedinFig.5-9. Part (a) showsa network. The first four columns of part (b) show the delay vectors received from the neighbors of router J. A claims to have a 12-msec delay to B, a 25-msec delay to C, a 40- msec delay to D, etc. Suppose that J has measured or estimated its delay to its neighbors,A,I,H,andK,as8,10,12,and6msec, respectively.

Similarly, it computes the delay to G via I, H, and K as 41 (31+10), 18 (6+12), and 37 (31+6) msec, respectively. The best of these values is 18, so it makes anentry inits routing table that the delay toGis18msec andthattheroute to use is via H. The same calculation is performed for all the other destinations, withthenewroutingtable showninthelast columnofthefigure. The Count-to-InfinityProblem The settling of routes to best paths across the network is called convergence. Distance vector routing is useful as a simple technique by which routers can col- lectively compute shortest paths, but it has a serious drawback in practice: al- though it converges to the correct answer, it may do so slowly. In particular, it reacts rapidly to good news, but leisurely to bad news. Consider a router whose best route to destination X is long\", 'If, on the next exchange, neighbor A suddenly reports a short delay to X, the router just switches over to using the line to A to sendtraffic toX. Inonevector exchange, thegoodnews isprocessed. To see how fast good news propagates, consider the five-node (linear) net- work of Fig.5-10, where the delay metric is the number of hops. Suppose A is down initially and all the other routers know this. In other words, they have all recorded thedelay toAasinfinity.

Thecount-to-infinityproblem. When A comes up, the other routers learn about it via the vector exchanges. For simplicity, we will assume that there is a gigantic gong somewhere that is struck periodically to initiate a vector exchange at all routers simultaneously. At the time of the first exchange, B learns that its left-hand neighbor has zero delay to A. B now makes an entry in its routing table indicating that A is one hop away to the left. All the other routers still think that A is down. At this point, the rout- ingtable entries forAare as showninthe secondrow ofFig. 5-10(a). Onthe next SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 373 exchange, Clearns that Bhas apath oflength 1toA,soitupdatesitsroutingtable to indicate a path of length 2, but D and E do not hear the good news until later. Clearly, the good news is spreading at the rate of one hop per exchange. In a net- work whose longest path is of length N hops, within N exchanges everyone will knowaboutnewly revived linksandrouters. Now let us consider the situation of Fig.5-10(b), in which all the links and routers are initially up. Routers B, C, D, and E have distances to A of 1, 2, 3, and 4hops,respectively. Suddenly,either Agoes downorthe link between Aand Bis cut(which iseffectively thesame thingfromB’spointofview). Atthe first packet exchange, Bdoes not hear anything from A. Fortunately, C says ‘‘Do not worry; I have a path toAoflength 2.’’Littledoes B suspect that C’s path runs through B itself. For all B knows, C might have ten links all with sepa- rate paths to A of length 2. As a result, B thinks it can reach A via C, with a path lengthof3. DandEdonotupdatetheir entries forAonthefirst exchange. On the second exchange, C notices that each of its neighbors claims to have a path to A of length 3. It picks one of them at random and makes its new distance to A 4, as shown in the third row of Fig.5-10(b). Subsequent exchanges produce thehistoryshownintherestofFig. 5-10(b)', 'From this figure, it should be clear why bad news travels slowly: no router ever has a value more than one higher than the minimum of all its neighbors. Gradually, all routers work their way up to infinity, but the number of exchanges required depends on the numerical value used for infinity. For this reason, it is wise tosetinfinitytothelongestpathplus1. Notentirely surprisingly, thisproblem isknownasthecount-to-infinityprob- lem. There have been many attempts to solve it, for example, preventing routers from advertising their best paths back to the neighbors from which they heard them with the split horizon with poisoned reverse rule discussed in RFC 1058. However, none of these heuristics work well in practice despite the colorful names. The core of the problem is that when X tells Y that it has a path some- where, Yhasnowayofknowingwhether ititself isonthepath. 5.2.5 Link State Routing Distance vector routing was used in the ARPANET until 1979, when it was replaced by link state routing. The primary problem that caused its demise was that the algorithm often took too long to converge after the network topology changed (due to the count-to-infinity problem). Consequently, it was replaced by an entirely new algorithm, now called link state routing. Variants of link state routing called IS-IS and OSPF are the routing algorithms that are most widely usedinsidelarge networks andtheInternet today. The idea behind link state routing is fairly simple and can be stated as five parts. Each routermustdothefollowing thingstomake itwork: 374 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 1. Discover itsneighborsandlearn their network addresses. 2. Set thedistance orcostmetric toeachofitsneighbors. 3. Construct apacket tellingallithasjustlearned. 4. Sendthispacket toandreceivepackets fromallother routers. 5. Compute theshortest pathtoevery other router. In effect, the complete topology is distributed to every router. Then Dijkstra’s al- gorithm can be run at each router to find the shortest path to every other router. Below wewillconsider eachofthese fivestepsinmoredetail. Learning about the Neighbors When a router is booted, its first task is to learn who its neighbors are. It accomplishes this goal by sending a special HELLO packet on each point-to-point line. The router onthe other end is expected to send back a reply giving its name. These names must be globally unique because when a distant router later hears that three routers are all connectedtoF,it isessential that it can determine wheth- erallthree mean thesame F. When two or more routers are connected by a broadcast link (e.g., a switch, ring, or classic Ethernet), the situation is slightly more complicated. Fig. 5-11(a) illustrates a broadcast LAN to which three routers, A, C, and F, are directly con- nected. Each of these routers is connected to one or more additional routers, as shown. H Router B D E D E G I G H B A C F C A F I LAN N (a) (b) Figure5-11. (a)NineroutersandabroadcastLAN.(b)Agraphmodelof(a). The broadcast LAN provides connectivity between each pair of attached rout- ers. However, modeling the LAN as many point-to-point links increases the size SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 375 of the topology and leads to wasteful messages', 'A better way to model the LAN is to consider it as a node itself, as shown in Fig.5-11(b). Here, we have intro- duced a new, artificial node, N, to which A, C, and F are connected. One desig- nated router on the LAN is selected to play the role of N in the routing protocol. The fact that it is possible to go from A to C on the LAN is represented by the pathANC here. Setting Link Costs The link state routing algorithm requires each link to have a distance or cost metric for finding shortest paths. The cost to reach neighbors can be set automat- ically, or configured by the network operator. A common choice is to make the cost inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the link. For example, 1-Gbps Ethernet may have a cost of 1 and 100-Mbps Ethernet a cost of 10. This makes higher-capacity pathsbetter choices. If the network is geographically spread out, the delay of the links may be fac- tored into the cost so that paths over shorter links are better choices. The most direct way to determine this delay is to send over the line a special ECHO packet that the other side is required to send back immediately. By measuring the round-trip time and dividing it by two, the sending router can get a reasonable estimate ofthedelay. Building Link State Packets Once the information needed for the exchange has been collected, the next step is for each router to build a packet containing all the data. The packet starts with the identity of the sender, followed by a sequence number and age (to be de- scribed later) and a list of neighbors. The cost toeach neighbor is also given. An example network is presented in Fig.5-12(a) with costs shown as labels on the lines. The corresponding link state packets for all six routers are shown in Fig.5- 12(b). Link State Packets B 2 C A B C D E F 4 3 Seq. Seq. Seq. Seq. Seq. Seq. A D Age Age Age Age Age Age 1 6 B 4 A 4 B 2 C 3 A 5 B 6 5 7 E 5 C 2 D 3 F 7 C 1 D 7 E 8 F F 6 E 1 F 8 E 8 (a) (b) Figure5-12. (a)Anetwork.(b)Thelinkstatepacketsforthisnetwork. 376 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Building the link state packets is easy. The hard part is determining when to build them. One possibility is to build them periodically, that is, at regular inter- vals. Another possibility is to build them when some significant event occurs, such as a line or neighbor going down or coming back up again or changing its properties appreciably. Distributing the Link State Packets The trickiest part of the algorithm is distributing the link state packets. All of the routers must get all of the link state packets quickly and reliably. If different routers are using different versions of the topology, the routes they compute can have inconsistencies suchasloops,unreachablemachines, andotherproblems. First, we will describe the basic distribution algorithm', 'After that we will give some refinements. The fundamental idea is to use flooding to distribute the link state packets to all routers. To keep the flood in check, each packet contains a sequence number that is incremented for each new packet sent. Routers keep track of all the (source router, sequence) pairs they see. When a new link state packet comes in,itischecked against the list ofpackets already seen. Ifit isnew, it is forwarded on all lines except the one it arrived on. If it is a duplicate, it is discarded. If a packet with a sequence number lower than the highest one seen so farever arrives, itisrejected asbeingobsolete astherouter hasmore recentdata. This algorithm has a few problems, but they are manageable. First, if the se- quence numbers wrap around, confusion will reign. The solution here is to use a 32-bit sequence number. With one link state packet per second, it would take 137 years towrap around,sothispossibilitycan beignored. Second,ifarouter ever crashes, it willlose track ofitssequence number. Ifit starts again at0,thenextpacket itsendswillberejected asaduplicate. Third, if a sequence number is ever corrupted and 65,540 is received instead of4(a 1-biterror), packets 5through65,540willberejected asobsolete, since the current sequence number willbethoughttobe65,540. The solution to all these problems is to include the age of each packet after the sequence number and decrement it once per second. When the age hits zero, the information from that router is discarded. Normally, a new packet comes in, say, every 10 sec, so router information only times out when a router is down (or six consecutive packets have been lost, an unlikely event). The Age field is also decremented by each router during the initial flooding process, to make sure no packet can get lost and live for an indefinite period of time (a packet whose age is zero isdiscarded). Some refinements to this algorithm make it more robust. When a link state packet comes in to a router for flooding, it is not queued for transmission im- mediately. Instead, it is put in a holding area to wait a short while in case more links are coming up or going down. If another link state packet from the same source comes in before the first packet is transmitted, their sequence numbers are SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 377 compared. If they are equal, the duplicate is discarded. If they are different, the older one isthrown out. Toguard against errors onthe links, all link state packets are acknowledged. The data structure used by router B for the network shown in Fig.5-12(a) is depicted in Fig.5-13. Each row here corresponds to a recently arrived, but as yet not fully processed, link state packet. The table records where the packet ori- ginated, its sequence number and age, and the data. In addition, there are send and acknowledgement flags for each of B’s three links (to A, C, and F, re- spectively). The send flags mean that the packet must be sent on the indicated link. Theacknowledgementflags mean thatitmustbeacknowledgedthere.

ThepacketbufferforrouterBinFig.5-12(a). In Fig. 5-13, the link state packet from A arrives directly, so it must be sent to CandFand acknowledgedtoA,asindicated bytheflagbits. Similarly, thepack- etfromFhastobeforwarded toAandCandacknowledgedtoF. However, the situation with the third packet, from E, is different. It arrives twice, once via EAB and once via EFB. Consequently, it has to be sent only to C butmustbeacknowledgedtobothAandF,asindicated bythebits. If a duplicate arrives while the original is still in the buffer, bits have to be changed. For example, if a copy of C’s state arrives from F before the fourth entry inthe table has been forwarded, the sixbitswillbechanged to100011toin- dicate thatthepacket mustbeacknowledgedtoFbutnotsentthere. Computing the NewRoutes Once a router has accumulated a full set of link state packets, it can construct the entire network graph because every link is represented. Every link is, in fact, represented twice, once for each direction. The different directions may even have different costs. Theshortest-path computations maythenfinddifferent paths fromrouter AtoBthanfromrouter BtoA. Now Dijkstra’s algorithm can be run locally to construct the shortest paths to all possible destinations. The results of this algorithm tell the router which link to 378 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 use to reach each destination. This information is installed in the routing tables, andnormal operation isresumed. Compared to distance vector routing, link state routing requires more memory and computation. For a network with n routers, each of which has k neighbors, the memory required to store the input data is proportional to kn, which is at least as large as a routing table listing all the destinations. Also, the computation time growsfaster than kn, even with the most efficient data structures, an issue inlarge networks. Nevertheless, in many practical situations, link state routing works well becauseitdoesnotsuffer fromslowconvergenceproblems. Link state routing is widely used in actual networks, so a few words about some example protocols are in order. Many ISPs use the IS-IS (Intermediate System-Intermediate System) link state protocol (Oran, 1990). It was designed for an early network called DECnet, later adopted by ISO for use with the OSI protocols and then modified to handle other protocols as well, most notably, IP. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is the other main link state protocol. It was designed by IETF several years after IS-IS and adopted many of the innovations designed for IS-IS. These innovations include a self-stabilizing method of flood- ing link state updates, the concept of a designated router ona LAN, and the meth- od of computing and supporting path splitting and multiple metrics. As a conse- quence, there is very little difference between IS-IS and OSPF. The most impor- tant difference is that IS-IS can carry information about multiple network layer protocols at the same time (e.g., IP, IPX, and AppleTalk)', 'OSPF does not have this feature, and it is an advantage in large multiprotocol environments. We will gooverOSPFinSec. 5.6.6. A general comment on routing algorithms is also in order. Link state, dis- tance vector, and other algorithms rely on processing at all the routers to compute routes. Problems with the hardware orsoftware at even a small number of routers can wreak havoc across the network. For example, if a router claims to have a link it does not have or forgets a link it does have, the network graph will be incorrect. If a router fails to forward packets or corrupts them while forwarding them, the route will not work as expected. Finally, if it runs out of memory or does the routing calculation wrong,bad thingswillhappen. Asthenetwork grows into the range of tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes, the probability of some router failingoccasionallybecomes nonnegligible. The trick istotrytoarrange to limit the damage when the inevitable happens. Perlman (1988) discusses these problems andtheir possible solutionsindetail. 5.2.6 Hierarchical Routing As networks grow in size, the router routing tables grow proportionally. Not only is router memory consumed by ever-increasing tables, but more CPU time is needed to scan them and more bandwidth is needed to send status reports about them. At a certain point, the network may grow to the point where it is no longer SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 379 feasible forevery router tohave anentry forevery other router, sothe routingwill have tobedonehierarchically, asitisinthetelephonenetwork. When hierarchical routing is used, the routers are divided into what we will call regions. Each router knowsall the details abouthowtoroute packets todest- inations within its own region but knows nothing about the internal structure of other regions. When different networks are interconnected, it is natural to regard each one as a separate region to free the routers in one network from having to knowthetopologicalstructure oftheother ones. For huge networks, a two-level hierarchy may be insufficient; it may be nec- essary to group the regions into clusters, the clusters into zones, the zones into groups,andsoon,untilwerunoutofnames foraggregations. As anexample ofa multilevel hierarchy, consider how a packet might be routed from Berkeley, Cali- fornia, toMalindi, Kenya. The Berkeley router would know the detailed topology within California but would send all out-of-state traffic to the Los Angeles router. The Los Angeles router would be able to route traffic directly to other domestic routers but would send all foreign traffic to New York. The New York router would be programmed to direct all traffic to the router in the destination country responsible for handling foreign traffic, say, inNairobi. Finally, the packet would workitswaydownthetree inKenya untilitgottoMalindi. Figure 5-14 gives a quantitative example of routing in a two-level hierarchy with five regions. The full routing table for router 1A has 17 entries, as shown in Fig.5-14(b). When routing is done hierarchically, as inFig', '5-14(c), there are en- tries for all the local routers, as before, but all other regions are condensed into a single router, so all traffic for region 2 goes via the 1B-2A line, but the rest of the remote traffic goes via the 1C-3B line. Hierarchical routing has reduced the table from 17 to 7 entries. As the ratio of the number of regions to the number of rout- ersperregiongrows,thesavingsintable spaceincrease. Unfortunately, these gains inspaceare notfree. There is a penalty to be paid: increased path length. For example, the best route from 1A to 5C is via region 2, but with hierarchical routing all traffic to region 5 goes via region 3, because that isbetter formostdestinations inregion5. When a single network becomes very large, an interesting question is ‘‘how many levels should the hierarchy have?’’ For example, consider a network with 720 routers. If there is no hierarchy, each router needs 720 routing table entries. If the network is partitioned into 24 regions of 30 routers each, each router needs 30 local entries plus 23 remote entries for a total of 53 entries. If a three-level hierarchy is chosen, with 8 clusters each containing 9 regions of 10 routers, each router needs 10 entries for local routers, 8 entries for routing to other regions within its own cluster, and 7 entries for distant clusters, for a total of 25 entries. KamounandKleinrock (1979)discovered that the optimal number oflevels foran N router network is ln N, requiring a total of e ln N entries per router. They have also shown that the increase in effective mean path length caused by hierarchical routingissufficiently small thatitisusually acceptable. 380 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Fulltablefor1A Hierarchicaltablefor1A Dest.

Hierarchical routing. 5.2.7 Broadcast Routing In some applications, hosts need to send messages to many or all other hosts. For example, a service distributing weather reports, stock market updates, or live radio programs might work best by sending to all machines and letting those that are interested read the data. Sending a packet toall destinations simultaneously is called broadcasting. Various methodshave beenproposedfordoingit. One broadcasting methodthat requires nospecial features from the network is for the source tosimply send a distinct packet toeach destination. Not onlyis the method wasteful of bandwidth and slow, but it also requires the source to have a complete list of all destinations. This method is not desirable in practice, even thoughitiswidely applicable', 'An improvement is multidestination routing, in which each packet contains either a list of destinations or a bit map indicating the desired destinations. When a packet arrives at a router, the router checks all the destinations to determine the set of output lines that will be needed. (An output line is needed if it is the best route to at least one of the destinations.) The router generates a new copy of the packet for each output line to be used and includes ineach packet onlythose dest- inations that are to use the line. In effect, the destination set is partitioned among SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 381 the output lines. After a sufficient number of hops, each packet will carry only one destination like a normal packet. Multidestination routing is like using sepa- rately addressed packets, except that when several packets must follow the same route, one of them pays full fare and the rest ride free. The network bandwidth is therefore used more efficiently. However, this scheme still requires the source to know all the destinations, plus it is as much work for a router to determine where tosendonemultidestinationpacket asitisformultipledistinct packets. We have already seen a better broadcast routing technique: flooding. When implemented with a sequence number per source, flooding uses links efficiently with a decision rule at routers that is relatively simple. Although flooding is ill- suited forordinary point-to-point communication, itrates serious consideration for broadcasting. However, it turns out that we can do better still once the shortest pathroutes forregular packets have been computed. The idea for reverse path forwarding is elegant and remarkably simple once it has been pointed out (Dalal and Metcalfe, 1978). When a broadcast packet ar- rives at a router, the router checks to see if the packet arrived on the link that is normally used for sending packets toward the source of the broadcast. If so, there isanexcellent chance that the broadcast packet itself followed the best route from the router and is therefore the first copy to arrive at the router. This being the case, the router forwards copies ofit ontoall links except the oneit arrived on. If, however, the broadcast packet arrived on a link other than the preferred one for reachingthesource, thepacket isdiscarded asalikely duplicate.

Part (a) shows a network, part (b) shows a sink tree for router I of that network, and part (c) shows how the reverse path algorithm works. On the first hop, I sends packets to F, H, J, and N, as indicated by the second row of the tree', 'Each of these packets arrives on the preferred path to I (assuming that the preferred path falls along the sink tree) and is so indicated by a circle around the letter. On the second hop, 382 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 eight packets are generated, two by each of the routers that received a packet on the first hop. As it turns out, all eight of these arrive at previously unvisited rout- ers, and five of these arrive along the preferred line. Of the six packets generated on the third hop, only three arrive on the preferred path (at C, E, and K); the oth- ers are duplicates. After five hops and 24 packets, the broadcasting terminates, compared withfourhopsand14packets hadthesinktree been followed exactly. The principal advantage of reverse path forwarding is that it is efficient while being easy to implement. It sends the broadcast packet over each link only once in each direction, just as in flooding, yet it requires only that routers know how to reach all destinations, without needing to remember sequence numbers (or use other mechanisms tostoptheflood)orlistalldestinations inthepacket. Our last broadcast algorithm improves on the behavior of reverse path for- warding. It makes explicit use of the sink tree—or any other convenient spanning tree—for the router initiating the broadcast. A spanning tree is a subset of the network that includes all the routers butcontains noloops.Sink trees are spanning trees. If each router knows which of its lines belong to the spanning tree, it can copy an incoming broadcast packet onto all the spanning tree lines except the one it arrived on. This method makes excellent use of bandwidth, generating the absolute minimum number of packets necessary to do the job. In Fig. 5-15, for example, when the sink tree of part (b) is used as the spanning tree, the broadcast packet is sent with the minimum 14packets. The only problem isthat eachrouter must have knowledge of some spanning tree for the method to be applicable. Sometimes this information is available (e.g., with link state routing, all routers know the complete topology, so they can compute a spanning tree) but sometimes itisnot(e.g., withdistance vector routing). 5.2.8 Multicast Routing Some applications, such as a multiplayer game or live video of a sports event streamed to many viewing locations, send packets to multiple receivers. Unless the group is very small, sending a distinct packet to each receiver is expensive. On the other hand, broadcasting a packet is wasteful if the group consists of, say, 1000 machines on a million-node network, so that most receivers are not inter- ested in the message (or worse yet, they are definitely interested but are not sup- posed to see it). Thus, we need a way to send messages to well-defined groups thatare numerically large insize butsmall compared tothenetwork asawhole. Sending a message to such a group is called multicasting, and the routing al- gorithm used is called multicast routing. All multicasting schemes require some way to create and destroy groups and to identify which routers are members of a group', 'How these tasks are accomplished is not of concern to the routing algo- rithm. For now, we will assume that each group is identified by a multicast ad- dress and that routers know the groups to which they belong. We will revisit groupmembership whenwedescribe thenetwork layer oftheInternet inSec. 5.6. SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 383 Multicastrouting schemes buildonthe broadcast routing schemes we have al- ready studied, sending packets along spanning trees to deliver the packets to the members of the group while making efficient use of bandwidth. However, the best spanning tree to use depends on whether the group is dense, with receivers scattered over most of the network, or sparse, with much of the network not be- longingtothegroup. Inthissection wewillconsider bothcases. If the group is dense, broadcast is a good start because it efficiently gets the packet to all parts of the network. But broadcast will reach some routers that are not members of the group, which is wasteful. The solution explored by Deering andCheriton (1990)istoprune the broadcast spanning tree byremoving linksthat donotlead tomembers. Theresult isanefficient multicastspanningtree. As an example, consider the two groups, 1 and 2, in the network shown in Fig.5-16(a). Some routers are attached to hosts that belong to one or both of these groups, as indicated in the figure. A spanning tree for the leftmost router is shown in Fig.5-16(b). This tree can be used for broadcast but is overkill for mu- lticast, as can be seen from the two pruned versions that are shown next. In Fig.5-16(c), all the links that do not lead to hosts that are members of group 1 have been removed. The result is the multicast spanning tree for the leftmost router to send to group 1. Packets are forwarded only along this spanning tree, which ismore efficient than the broadcast tree because there are 7links instead of 10. Fig. 5-16(d) shows the multicast spanning tree after pruning for group2. It is efficient too, with only five links this time. It also shows that different multicast groupshave different spanningtrees. Various ways of pruning the spanning tree are possible. The simplest one can be used if link state routing is used and each router is aware of the complete topo- logy, including which hosts belong to which groups. Each router can then con- struct its own pruned spanning tree for each sender to the group in question by constructing a sink tree for the sender as usual and then removing all links that do not connect group members to the sink node. MOSPF (Multicast OSPF) is an example ofalinkstate protocol thatworksinthisway(Moy,1994). With distance vector routing, a different pruning strategy can be followed. The basic algorithm is reverse path forwarding. However, whenever a router with no hosts interested in a particular group and no connections to other routers re- ceives a multicast message for that group, it responds with aPRUNE message, tel- lingtheneighborthatsentthe message nottosend it anymore multicastsfrom the sender forthat group', 'When a router withnogroupmembers amongitsownhosts has received such messages onall the lines to which it sends the multicast, it, too, can respond with a PRUNE message. In this way, the spanning tree is recursively pruned. DVMRP (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol) is an example ofamulticastroutingprotocol thatworksthisway(Waitzman etal., 1988). Pruning results in efficient spanning trees that use only the links that are actu- ally needed to reach members of the group. One potential disadvantage is that it is lots of work for routers, especially for large networks. Suppose that a network 384 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 2 1 2 1 1,2 1,2 1,2 1,2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 (a) (b) 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 (c) (d) Figure5-16. (a) A network. (b) A spanning tree for the leftmost router. (c) A multicasttreeforgroup1.(d)Amulticasttreeforgroup2. has n groups, each with an average of m nodes. At each router and for each group, m pruned spanning trees must be stored, for a total of mn trees. For exam- ple, Fig. 5-16(c) gives the spanning tree for the leftmost router to send to group 1. The spanning tree for the rightmost router to send to group 1 (not shown) will look quite different, as packets will head directly for group members rather than via the left side of the graph. This in turn means that routers must forward pack- ets destined to group1in different directions depending on which node is sending to the group. When many large groups with many senders exist, considerable storage isneeded tostoreallthetrees. Analternative designusescore-based treestocompute asingle spanning tree for the group(Ballardie et al., 1993). All of the routers agree ona root(called the core or rendezvous point) and build the tree by sending a packet from each member to the root. The tree is the union of the paths traced by these packets. Fig.5-17(a) shows a core-based tree for group 1. To send to this group, a sender sends apacket tothecore. When thepacket reachesthe core, itisforwarded down the tree. This is shown in Fig. 5-17(b) for the sender on the righthand side of the network. As a performance optimization, packets destined for the group do not need to reach the core before they are multicast. As soon as a packet reaches the SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 385 tree, it can be forwarded up toward the root, as well as down all the other branches. Thisisthecase forthesender atthetopofFig. 5-17(b). 1 1 Sender 1 1 Sender 1 1 Core Core 1 1 1 1 (a) (b) Figure5-17. (a)Core-basedtreeforgroup1.(b)Sendingtogroup1. Having a shared tree is not optimal for all sources. For example, in Fig.5- 17(b), the packet fromthe sender onthe righthand sidereachesthetop-rightgroup member via the core in three hops, instead of directly. The inefficiency depends onwhere the core andsenders are located, butoften it isreasonable whenthecore is in the middle of the senders. When there is only a single sender, as in a video thatisstreamed toagroup,usingthesender asthecore isoptimal. Also of note is that shared trees can be a major savings in storage costs, mes- sages sent, and computation', 'Each router has to keep only one tree per group, in- stead of m trees. Further, routers that are not part of the tree do no work at all to support the group. For this reason, shared tree approaches like core-based trees are used for multicasting to sparse groups in the Internet as part of popular proto- colssuchasPIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)(Fenner etal., 2006). 5.2.9 Anycast Routing So far, we have covered delivery models in which a source sends to a single destination (called unicast), to all destinations (called broadcast), and to a group of destinations (called multicast). Another delivery model, called anycast is sometimes also useful. In anycast, a packet is delivered tothe nearest member of a group (Partridge et al., 1993). Schemes that find these paths are called anycast routing. Why would we want anycast? Sometimes nodes provide a service, such as time of day or content distribution for which it is getting the right information all that matters, not the node that is contacted; any node will do. For example, any- cast isusedintheInternet aspartofDNS, aswewillsee inChap. 7. Luckily, we will not have to devise new routing schemes for anycast because regular distance vector and link state routing can produce anycast routes. Suppose 386 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 we want toanycast tothe members of group1. They will all be given the address ‘‘1,’’instead ofdifferent addresses. Distance vector routing willdistribute vectors as usual, and nodes will choose the shortest path to destination 1. This will result in nodes sending to the nearest instance of destination 1. The routes are shown in Fig.5-18(a). This procedure works because the routing protocol does not realize that there are multiple instances of destination 1. That is, it believes that all the instances ofnode1are thesame node,asinthetopologyshowninFig.5-18(b). 1 1 1 1 1 1 (a) (b) Figure5-18. (a)Anycastroutestogroup1.(b)Topologyseenbytheroutingprotocol. This procedure works for link state routing as well, although there is the added consideration that the routing protocol must not find seemingly short paths that pass through node 1. This would result in jumps through hyperspace, since the instances of node 1 are really nodes located in different parts of the network. However, link state protocols already make this distinction between routers and hosts. We glossed over this fact earlier because it was not needed for our dis- cussion. 5.2.10 Routing for Mobile Hosts Millions of people use computers while on the go, from truly mobile situa- tions with wireless devices in moving cars, to nomadic situations in which laptop computers are used ina series ofdifferent locations. We will use the term mobile hosts to mean either category, as distinct from stationary hosts that never move. Increasingly, people want tostayconnectedwherever intheworldtheymaybe, as easily as if they were at home. These mobile hosts introduce a new complication: toroute apacket toamobile host,thenetwork firsthastofindit. The model of the world that we will consider is one in which all hosts are as- sumed to have a permanent home location that never changes', 'Each hosts also has a permanent home address that can be used to determine its home location, analogous to the way the telephone number 1-212-5551212 indicates the United States (country code 1) and Manhattan (212). The routing goal in systems with SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 387 mobile hosts is to make it possible to send packets to mobile hosts using their fixed home addresses and have the packets efficiently reach them wherever they maybe. Thetrick, ofcourse, istofindthem. Some discussion of this model is in order. A different model would be to recompute routes as the mobile host moves and the topology changes. We could then simply use the routing schemes described earlier in this section. However, with a growing number of mobile hosts, this model would soon lead to the entire network endlessly computing new routes. Using the home addresses greatly re- duces thisburden. Another alternative would be to provide mobility above the network layer, which iswhat typically happens withlaptops today. When they are movedtonew Internet locations, laptops acquire new network addresses. There is no association between the oldandnew addresses; thenetwork doesnotknowthattheybelonged to the same laptop. In this model, a laptop can be used to browse the Web, but other hosts cannot send packets to it (for example, for an incoming call), without building a higher layer location service, for example, signing into Skype again after moving. Moreover, connections cannot be maintained while the host is mov- ing; new connections must be started up instead. Network-layer mobility is useful tofixthese problems. The basic idea used for mobile routing in the Internet and cellular networks is for the mobile host to tell a host at the home location where it is now. This host, which acts onbehalf of the mobile host, is called the home agent. Once it knows where the mobile host is currently located, it can forward packets so that they are delivered. Fig.5-19 shows mobile routing in action. A sender in the northwest city of Seattle wants to send a packet to a host normally located across the United States in New York. The case of interest to us is when the mobile host is not at home. Instead, itistemporarily inSanDiego. The mobile host in San Diego must acquire a local network address before it can use the network. This happens in the normal way that hosts obtain network addresses; we will cover how this works for the Internet later in this chapter. The local address is called a care of address. Once the mobile host has this address, it can tell its home agent where it is now. It does this by sending a registration message to the home agent (step 1) with the care of address. The message is shownwith adashed line inFig.5-19toindicate that itisa control message, nota data message. Next, the sender sends a data packet to the mobile host using its permanent address (step 2). This packet is routed by the network to the host’s home location because that is where the home address belongs', 'In New York, the home agent intercepts this packet because the mobile host is away from home. It then wraps or encapsulates the packet with a new header and sends this bundle to the care of address (step 3). This mechanism is called tunneling. It is very important in the Internet sowewilllookatitinmoredetail later. 388 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Sender 2:Sendtohomeaddress 4:Reply tosender 5:Tunnel to ad c d a r r e e s o s f 1: 3 R : e T g u i n s n te e r l c to ar c e a o re f a o d f d a r d e d s r s ess H h o o m m e ea a d g d e r n e t s a s t Mobilehostat careofaddress Figure5-19. Packetroutingformobilehosts. When the encapsulated packet arrives at the care of address, the mobile host unwraps it and retrieves the packet from the sender. The mobile host then sends itsreply packet directly tothe sender (step 4). The overall route is called triangle routing because it may be circuitous if the remote location is far from the home location. Aspart ofstep 4,the sender may learn the current care of address. Sub- sequent packets can be routed directly to the mobile host bytunneling them to the care of address (step 5), bypassing the home location entirely. If connectivity is lost for any reason as the mobile moves, the home address can always be used to reachthemobile. Animportant aspect that we have omitted from this description is security. In general, when a host or router gets a message of the form ‘‘Starting right now, please send all of Stephany’s mail to me,’’ it might have a couple of questions about whom it is talking to and whether this is a good idea. Security information is included in the messages so that their validity can be checked with crypto- graphic protocols thatwewillstudyinChap. 8. There are many variations on mobile routing. The scheme above is modeled on IPv6 mobility, the form of mobility used in the Internet (Johnson et al., 2004) and as part of IP-based cellular networks such as UMTS. We showed the sender to be a stationary node for simplicity, but the designs let both nodes be mobile hosts. Alternatively, the host may be part of a mobile network, for example a computer in a plane. Extensions of the basic scheme support mobile networks withnoworkonthepart ofthehosts(Devarapallietal., 2005). Some schemes make use of a foreign (i.e., remote) agent, similar to the home agent but at the foreign location, or analogous to the VLR (Visitor Location Reg- ister) in cellular networks. However, in more recent schemes, the foreign agent is not needed; mobile hosts act as their own foreign agents. In either case, know- ledge of the temporary location of the mobile host is limited to a small number of SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 389 hosts (e.g., the mobile, home agent, and senders) so that the many routers in a large network donotneed torecompute routes', 'For more information about mobile routing, see also Perkins (1998, 2002)and Snoeren andBalakrishnan (2000). 5.2.11 Routing in Ad Hoc Networks We have now seen how to do routing when the hosts are mobile but the rout- ers are fixed. An even more extreme case is one in which the routers themselves are mobile. Amongthe possibilities are emergency workers at an earthquake site, military vehicles on a battlefield, a fleet of ships at sea, or a gathering of people withlaptopcomputers inanarea lacking 802.11. In all these cases, and others, each node communicates wirelessly and acts as both a host anda router. Networks ofnodesthat just happen tobenear eachother are called ad hoc networks or MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc NETworks). Let us nowexamine thembriefly. Moreinformation can befoundinPerkins (2001). What makes ad hoc networks different from wired networks is that the topo- logyissuddenlytossed outthe window. Nodes can come andgoorappear innew places at the drop of a bit. With a wired network, if a router has a valid path to some destination, that path continues to be valid barring failures, which are hope- fully rare. With an ad hoc network, the topologymay be changing all the time, so the desirability and even the validity of paths can change spontaneously without warning. Needless to say, these circumstances make routing in ad hoc networks more challenging thanroutingintheir fixed counterparts. Many, many routing algorithms for ad hoc networks have been proposed. However, since ad hoc networks have been little used in practice compared to mobile networks, it is unclear which of these protocols are most useful. As an ex- ample, we will look at one of the most popular routing algorithms, AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) (Perkins and Royer, 1999). It is a relative of the distance vector algorithm that has been adapted to work in a mobile environ- ment, in which nodes often have limited bandwidth and battery lifetimes. Let us nowsee howitdiscovers andmaintains routes. Route Discovery In AODV, routes to a destination are discovered on demand, that is, only when a somebody wants to send a packet to that destination. This saves much work that would otherwise be wasted when the topology changes before the route is used. At any instant, the topology of an ad hoc network can be described by a graph of connected nodes. Two nodes are connected (i.e., have an arc between them in the graph) if they can communicate directly using their radios. A basic but adequate model that is sufficient for our purposes is that each node can com- municate with all other nodesthat lie within its coverage circle. Real networks are 390 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 more complicated, with buildings, hills, and other obstacles that block communi- cation, and nodes for which A is connected to B but B is not connected to A be- cause A has a more powerful transmitter than B. However, for simplicity, we will assume allconnectionsare symmetric. To describe the algorithm, consider the newly formed ad hoc network of Fig.5-20. Supposethat a process at nodeAwants tosend a packet tonodeI', 'The AODV algorithm maintains a distance vector table at each node, keyed by desti- nation, giving information about that destination, including the neighbor to which to send packets to reach the destination. First, A looks in its table and does not find an entry for I. It now has to discover a route to I. This property of discover- ingroutes onlywhentheyare needed iswhat makes thisalgorithm ‘‘ondemand.’’ Rangeof A’sbroadcast A B A B A B A B C C C C D D D D E E E E F F F F G G G G H I H I H I H I (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure5-20.

The solidlines showthediscoveredroute. To locate I, A constructs a ROUTE REQUEST packet and broadcasts it using flooding,as described inSec. 5.2.3. The transmission from A reaches B andD,as illustratedinFig. 5-20(a). Each noderebroadcasts the request, which continues to reach nodes F, G, and C in Fig. 5-20(c) and nodes H, E, and I in Fig.5-20(d). A sequence number set at the source is used to weed out duplicates during the flood. For example, D discards the transmission from B in Fig.5-20(c) because it has al- ready forwarded therequest. Eventually, the request reaches node I, which constructs a ROUTE REPLY packet. This packet is unicast to the sender along the reverse of the path followed bythe request. For this to work, each intermediate node must remember the node that sent it the request. The arrows in Fig.5-20(b)–(d) show the reverse route information that is stored. Each intermediate node also increments a hop count as it forwards the reply. This tells the nodes how far they are from the destination. The replies telleachintermediate nodewhichneighbortouse toreach the destina- tion: it is the node that sent them the reply. Intermediate nodes G and D put the SEC. 5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS 391 best route they hear into their routing tables as they process the reply. When the reply reachesA,anewroute, ADGI,hasbeen created. Inalarge network, thealgorithm generates many broadcasts, even fordestina- tions that are close by. To reduce overhead, the scope of the broadcasts is limited using the IP packet’s Time to live field. This field is initialized by the sender and decremented on each hop. If it hits 0, the packet is discarded instead of being broadcast. The route discovery process is then modified as follows. To locate a destination, the sender broadcasts aROUTEREQUEST packet withTime tolive set to1. Ifnoresponsecomes back within areasonable time, another one is sent, this time with Time to live set to 2. Subsequent attempts use 3, 4, 5, etc. In this way, thesearch isfirst attempted locally, theninincreasingly wider rings. Route Maintenance Because nodes can move or be switched off, the topology can change spon- taneously. For example, in Fig.5-20, if G is switched off, A will not realize that the route it was using to I (ADGI) is no longer valid', 'The algorithm needs to be able to deal with this. Periodically, each node broadcasts a Hello message. Each of its neighbors is expected to respond to it. If no response is forthcoming, the broadcaster knows that that neighbor has moved out of range or failed and is no longer connected to it. Similarly, if it tries to send a packet to a neighbor that doesnotrespond,itlearns thattheneighborisnolongeravailable. This information is used to purge routes that no longer work. For each pos- sible destination, each node, N, keeps track of its active neighbors that have fed it a packet for that destination during the last ΔT seconds. When any of N’s neigh- bors becomes unreachable, it checks its routing table to see which destinations have routes using the now-gone neighbor. For each of these routes, the active neighbors are informed that their route via N is now invalid and must be purged fromtheir routing tables. Inourexample, Dpurges its entries for G and I from its routing table and notifies A, which purges its entry for I. In the general case, the active neighbors tell their active neighbors, and so on, recursively, until all routes depending onthenow-gonenodeare purgedfromallroutingtables. Atthisstage, the invalid routes have been purged fromthe network, and send- ers can find new, valid routes by using the discovery mechanism that we de- scribed. However, there is a complication. Recall that distance vector protocols can suffer from slow convergence or count-to-infinity problems after a topology change inwhich theyconfuse old,invalid routeswithnew, validroutes. To ensure rapid convergence, routes include a sequence number that is con- trolled by the destination. The destination sequence number is like a logical clock. The destination increments it every time that it sends a fresh ROUTE REPLY. Senders ask for a fresh route by including in the ROUTE REQUEST the destination sequence number of the last route they used, which will either be the sequence number of the route that was just purged, or 0 as an initial value. The 392 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 request will be broadcast until a route with a higher sequence number is found. Intermediate nodes store the routes that have a higher sequence number, or the fewest hopsforthecurrent sequence number. In the spirit of an on demand protocol, intermediate nodes only store the routes that are in use. Other route information learned during broadcasts is timed outafter ashortdelay. Discovering and storingonlythe routes that are used helps tosave bandwidth andbattery life compared toastandard distance vector protocol thatperiodically broadcasts updates. So far, we have considered only a single route, from A to I. To further save resources, route discovery and maintenance are shared when routes overlap. For instance, if B also wants to send packets to I, it will perform route discovery. However, inthis case the request willfirst reachD,which already has a route toI. Node D can then generate a reply to tell B the route without any additional work beingrequired. There are many other ad hoc routing schemes. Another well-known on de- mand scheme is DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) (Johnson et al., 2001)', 'A dif- ferent strategy based ongeographyisexplored byGPSR (Greedy Perimeter State- less Routing) (Karp and Kung, 2000). If all nodes know their geographic posi- tions, forwarding to a destination can proceed without route computation by sim- ply heading in the right direction and circling back to escape any dead ends. Which protocols win out will depend on the kinds of ad hoc networks that prove usefulinpractice. 5.3 CONGESTION CONTROL ALGORITHMS Too many packets present in (a part of) the network causes packet delay and loss that degrades performance. This situation is called congestion. The network and transport layers share the responsibility for handling congestion. Since con- gestion occurs within the network, it is the network layer that directly experiences it and must ultimately determine what to do with the excess packets. However, the most effective way to control congestion is to reduce the load that the tran- sportlayer isplacing onthe network. Thisrequires the network and transport lay- ers to work together. In this chapter we will look at the network aspects of con- gestion. In Chap. 6, we will complete the topic by covering the transport aspects ofcongestion. Figure 5-21 depicts the onset of congestion. When the number of packets hosts send into the network is well within its carrying capacity, the number deliv- ered is proportional to the number sent. If twice as many are sent, twice as many are delivered. However, as the offered load approaches the carrying capacity, bursts of traffic occasionally fill up the buffers inside routers and some packets are lost. These lost packets consume some of the capacity, so the number of de- livered packets falls below theideal curve. Thenetwork isnowcongested. SEC. 5.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL ALGORITHMS 393 Ideal )ces/stekcap(tupdooG Capacityof thenetwork Desirable response Congestion Onsetof collapse congestion Offeredload(packet/sec) Figure5-21. Withtoomuchtraffic,performance dropssharply. Unless thenetwork iswell designed, itmay experience a congestion collapse, in which performance plummets as the offered load increases beyond the capaci- ty. This can happen because packets can be sufficiently delayed inside the net- work that they are no longer useful when they leave the network. For example, in the early Internet, the time a packet spent waiting for a backlog of packets ahead of it to be sent over a slow 56-kbps link could reach the maximum time it was al- lowedtoremain inthenetwork. Itthenhadtobe thrown away. Adifferent failure mode occurs when senders retransmit packets that are greatly delayed, thinking that they have been lost. In this case, copies of the same packet will be delivered by the network, again wasting its capacity. To capture these factors, the y-axis of Fig.5-21 is given as goodput, which is the rate at which useful packets are deliv- ered bythenetwork. We would like to design networks that avoid congestion where possible and donotsuffer from congestioncollapse iftheydobecome congested. Unfortunate- ly, congestion cannot wholly be avoided. If all of a sudden, streams of packets begin arriving on three or four input lines and all need the same output line, a queue will build up. If there is insufficient memory to hold all of them, packets will be lost', 'Adding more memory may help up to a point, butNagle (1987)real- ized that if routers have an infinite amount of memory, congestion gets worse, not better. This isbecause bythe time packets get tothe frontofthe queue, they have already timed out(repeatedly) and duplicates have been sent. This makes matters worse, notbetter—it leads tocongestioncollapse. Low-bandwidth linksorrouters that process packets more slowly than the line rate can also become congested. In this case, the situation can be improved by directing some of the traffic away from the bottleneck to other parts of the net- work. Eventually, however, all regions of the network will be congested. In this situation, there isnoalternative buttoshedloadorbuildafaster network. It is worth pointing out the difference between congestion control and flow control, as the relationship is a very subtle one. Congestion control has todowith 394 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 makingsurethenetwork isable tocarry theoffered traffic. Itisaglobal issue, in- volving the behavior of all the hosts and routers. Flow control, in contrast, relates to the traffic between a particular sender and a particular receiver. Its job is to make sure that a fast sender cannot continually transmit data faster than the re- ceiver isable toabsorbit. To see the difference between these two concepts, consider a network made up of 100-Gbps fiber optic links on which a supercomputer is trying to force feed a large file to a personal computer that is capable of handling only 1 Gbps. Al- though there is no congestion (the network itself is not in trouble), flow control is needed to force the supercomputer to stop frequently to give the personal com- puter achance tobreathe. At the other extreme, consider a network with 1-Mbps lines and 1000 large computers, half of which are trying to transfer files at 100 kbps to the other half. Here, the problem is not that of fast senders overpowering slow receivers, but that thetotal offered traffic exceedswhat thenetwork can handle. The reason congestion control and flow control are often confused is that the best way to handle both problems is to get the host to slow down. Thus, a host can get a ‘‘slow down’’ message either because the receiver cannot handle the load or because the network cannot handle it. We will come back to this point in Chap. 6. We willstart ourstudyofcongestioncontrol bylookingat the approaches that can be used at different time scales. Then we will look at approaches to pre- venting congestion from occurring in the first place, followed by approaches for copingwithitonce ithassetin. 5.3.1 Approaches to Congestion Control The presence of congestion means that the load is (temporarily) greater than the resources (in a part of the network) can handle. Two solutions come to mind: increase the resources or decrease the load. As shown in Fig. 5-22, these solu- tions are usually applied on different time scales to either prevent congestion or reacttoitonce ithasoccurred.

Timescalesofapproachestocongestioncontrol', 'The most basic way to avoid congestion is to build a network that is well matched to the traffic that it carries. If there is a low-bandwidth link on the path along which most traffic is directed, congestion is likely. Sometimes resources SEC. 5.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL ALGORITHMS 395 can be added dynamically when there is serious congestion, for example, turning onspare routers orenabling lines that are normally used onlyas backups (to make the system fault tolerant) or purchasing bandwidth on the open market. More often, linksandrouters thatare regularly heavily utilizedare upgradedatthe earli- est opportunity. This is called provisioning and happens on a time scale of months,drivenbylong-termtraffic trends. To make the most of the existing network capacity, routes can be tailored to traffic patterns that change during the day as network users wake and sleep indif- ferent time zones. For example, routes may be changed to shift traffic away from heavily used paths by changing the shortest path weights. Some local radio sta- tions have helicopters flying around their cities to report on road congestion to make it possible for their mobile listeners to route their packets (cars) around hotspots. This is called traffic-aware routing. Splitting traffic across multiple pathsisalso helpful. However, sometimes it is not possible to increase capacity. The only way then to beat back the congestion is to decrease the load. In a virtual-circuit net- work, new connections can be refused if they would cause the network to become congested. Thisiscalled admission control. At a finer granularity, when congestion is imminent the network can deliver feedback to the sources whose traffic flows are responsible for the problem. The network can request these sources to throttle their traffic, or it can slow down the traffic itself. Two difficulties with this approach are how to identify the onset of conges- tion, and how to inform the source that needs to slow down. To tackle the first issue, routers can monitor the average load, queueing delay, or packet loss. In all cases, risingnumbers indicate growingcongestion. To tackle the second issue, routers must participate in a feedback loop with the sources. For ascheme toworkcorrectly, thetimescale mustbeadjusted care- fully. If every time two packets arrive in a row, a router yells STOP and every time a router is idle for 20 μsec, it yells GO, the system will oscillate wildly and never converge. On the other hand, if it waits 30 minutes to make sure before saying anything, the congestion-control mechanism will react too sluggishly to be of any use. Delivering timely feedback is a nontrivial matter. An added concern ishavingrouters sendmoremessages whenthenetwork isalready congested. Finally, when all else fails, the network is forced to discard packets that it cannot deliver. The general name for this is load shedding. A good policy for choosingwhich packets todiscard canhelptoprevent congestioncollapse. 5.3.2 Traffic-Aware Routing The first approach we will examine is traffic-aware routing. The routing schemes we looked at in Sec 5.2 used fixed link weights. These schemes adapted to changes in topology, but not to changes in load. The goal in taking load into 396 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP', '5 account when computing routes is to shift traffic away from hotspots that will be thefirst placesinthe network toexperience congestion. The most direct way to do this is to set the link weight to be a function of the (fixed) link bandwidth and propagation delay plus the (variable) measured load or average queuing delay. Least-weight paths will then favor paths that are more lightlyloaded, allelse beingequal. Traffic-aware routing was used in the early Internet according to this model (Khanna and Zinky, 1989). However, there is a peril. Consider the network of Fig.5-23, which is divided into two parts, East and West, connected by two links, CF and EI. Suppose that most of the traffic between East and West is using link CF,and, as aresult, thislink isheavily loaded with longdelays. Including queue- ing delay in the weight used for the shortest path calculation will make EI more attractive. After thenewroutingtables have been installed, most ofthe East-West traffic will now go over EI, loading this link. Consequently, in the next update, CF will appear to be the shortest path. As a result, the routing tables may oscil- late wildly, leading toerratic routingandmanypotential problems. West East G B C F H A E I D J Figure5-23. AnetworkinwhichtheEastandWestpartsareconnectedbytwolinks. If load is ignored and only bandwidth and propagation delay are considered, this problem does not occur. Attempts to include load but change weights within a narrow range only slow down routing oscillations. Two techniques can contri- bute to a successful solution. The first is multipath routing, in which there can be multiple paths from a source to a destination. In our example this means that the traffic can be spread across both of the East to West links. The second one is for the routing scheme to shift traffic across routes slowly enough that it is able to converge,asinthescheme ofGallagher (1977). Given these difficulties, in the Internet routing protocols do not generally ad- just their routes depending on the load. Instead, adjustments are made outside the routingprotocol byslowlychanging itsinputs. Thisiscalled traffic engineering. SEC. 5.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL ALGORITHMS 397 5.3.3 Admission Control One technique that is widely used in virtual-circuit networks to keep conges- tion at bay is admission control. The idea is simple: do not set up a new virtual circuit unless the network can carry the added traffic without becoming congest- ed. Thus, attempts toset upavirtual circuit mayfail. Thisisbetter thanthealter- native, as letting more people in when the network is busy just makes matters worse. By analogy, in the telephone system, when a switch gets overloaded it practices admission control bynotgivingdialtones. The trick with this approach is working out when a new virtual circuit will lead to congestion. The task is straightforward in the telephone network because of the fixed bandwidth of calls (64 kbps for uncompressed audio). However, vir- tual circuits in computer networks come in all shapes and sizes. Thus, the circuit must come with some characterization of its traffic if we are to apply admission control. Traffic is often described in terms of its rate and shape', 'The problem of how to describe it in a simple yet meaningful way is difficult because traffic is typi- cally bursty—the average rate is only half the story. For example, traffic that varies while browsing the Web is more difficult to handle than a streaming movie with the same long-term throughput because the bursts of Web traffic are more likely to congest routers in the network. A commonly used descriptor that cap- tures thiseffect isthe leaky bucket or token bucket. A leaky bucket has two pa- rameters that bound the average rate and the instantaneous burst size of traffic. Since leaky buckets are widely used for quality of service, we will go over them indetail inSec. 5.4. Armed with traffic descriptions, the network can decide whether to admit the new virtual circuit. One possibility is for the network to reserve enough capacity along the paths of each of its virtual circuits that congestion will not occur. In this case, the traffic description is a service agreement for what the network will guar- antee its users. We have prevented congestion but veered into the related topic of qualityofservice alittletooearly; wewillreturntoitinthenextsection. Even without making guarantees, the network can use traffic descriptions for admission control. The task is then to estimate how many circuits will fit within the carrying capacity of the network without congestion. Suppose that virtual cir- cuits that may blast traffic at rates up to 10 Mbps all pass through the same 100- Mbps physical link. How many circuits should be admitted? Clearly, 10 circuits can be admitted without risking congestion, but this is wasteful in the normal case since it may rarely happen that all 10 are transmitting full blast at the same time. In real networks, measurements of past behavior that capture the statistics of transmissions can beused toestimate the number ofcircuits toadmit, totrade bet- ter performance foracceptablerisk. Admission control can also becombined with traffic-aware routing byconsid- ering routes around traffic hotspots as part of the setup procedure. For example, 398 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 consider the network illustrated in Fig.5-24(a), in which two routers are congest- ed,asindicated. A Congestion A B B Virtual circuit Congestion (a) (b) Figure5-24. (a)Acongestednetwork.(b)Theportionofthenetworkthatisnot congested.AvirtualcircuitfromAtoBisalsoshown. Suppose that a host attached torouter A wants to set up a connection to a host attached to router B. Normally, this connection would pass through one of the congestedrouters. Toavoidthissituation, wecan redraw thenetwork asshown in Fig.5-24(b), omitting the congested routers and all of their lines. The dashed line shows a possible route for the virtual circuit that avoids the congested routers. Shaikh etal.(1999)giveadesignforthiskindofload-sensitiverouting. 5.3.4 Traffic Throttling In the Internet and many other computer networks, senders adjust their trans- missions to send as much traffic as the network can readily deliver. Inthis setting, the network aims to operate just before the onset of congestion. When congestion is imminent, it must tell the senders to throttle back their transmissions and slow down. Thisfeedback isbusiness as usual rather than an exceptional situation. The term congestion avoidance is sometimes used to contrast this operating point withtheoneinwhichthenetwork hasbecome (overly) congested', 'Let us now look at some approaches to throttling traffic that can be used in both datagram networks and virtual-circuit networks. Each approach must solve two problems. First, routers must determine when congestion is approaching, ideally before it has arrived. To do so, each router can continuously monitor the resources it is using. Three possibilities are the utilization of the output links, the buffering of queued packets inside the router, and the number of packets that are lost due to insufficient buffering. Of these possibilities, the second one is the most useful. Averages of utilization do not directly account for the burstiness of SEC. 5.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL ALGORITHMS 399 most traffic—a utilization of 50% may be low for smooth traffic and too high for highly variable traffic. Counts of packet losses come too late. Congestion has al- ready setinbythetimethatpackets are lost. The queueing delay inside routers directly captures any congestion experi- enced by packets. It should be low most of time, but will jump when there is a burst of traffic that generates a backlog. To maintain a good estimate of the queueing delay, d,asample oftheinstantaneous queue length,s,can bemade per- iodically anddupdatedaccordingto d =αd +(1−α)s new old where theconstant αdetermines howfast therouter forgets recenthistory. This is called an EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average). It smoothes out fluctuations and is equivalent to a low-pass filter. Whenever d moves above the threshold, therouter notestheonsetofcongestion. The second problem is that routers must deliver timely feedback to the send- ers that are causing the congestion. Congestionis experienced inthe network, but relieving congestionrequires action onbehalf ofthesenders thatare usingthe net- work. To deliver feedback, the router must identify the appropriate senders. It must then warn them carefully, without sending many more packets into the al- ready congested network. Different schemes use different feedback mechanisms, aswewillnowdescribe. Choke Packets The most direct way to notify a sender of congestion is to tell it directly. In this approach, the router selects a congested packet and sends a choke packet back to the source host, giving it the destination found in the packet. The original packet may be tagged (a header bit is turned on) so that it will not generate any more choke packets farther along the path and then forwarded in the usual way. To avoid increasing load on the network during a time of congestion, the router mayonlysendchokepackets atalowrate. When the source host gets the choke packet, it is required to reduce the traffic sent to the specified destination, for example, by 50%. In a datagram network, simply picking packets at random when there is congestion is likely to cause choke packets to be sent to fast senders, because they will have the most packets in the queue. The feedback implicit in this protocol can help prevent congestion yet notthrottle any sender unless it causes trouble. For the same reason, it islike- ly that multiple choke packets will be sent to a given host and destination. The host should ignore these additional chokes for the fixed time interval until its reduction in traffic takes effect', 'After that period, further choke packets indicate thatthenetwork isstillcongested. An example of a choke packet used in the early Internet is the SOURCE- QUENCH message (Postel, 1981). It never caught on, though, partly because the 400 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 circumstances in which it was generated and the effect it had were not clearly specified. The modern Internet uses analternative notification design that we will describe next. Explicit Congestion Notification Instead of generating additional packets to warn of congestion, a router can tag any packet it forwards (by setting a bit in the packet’s header) to signal that it isexperiencing congestion. When the network delivers the packet, the destination can note thatthere iscongestionandinformthesender whenitsendsareply pack- et.The sender canthenthrottleitstransmissions asbefore. This design is called ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) and is used in the Internet (Ramakrishnan et al., 2001). It is a refinement of early congestion signaling protocols, notably the binary feedback scheme of Ramakrishnan and Jain (1988) that was used in the DECNET architecture. Two bits in the IP packet header are used torecord whether the packet has experienced congestion. Packets are unmarked when they are sent, as illustrated in Fig. 5-25. If any of the routers they pass through is congested, that router will then mark the packet as having experienced congestion as it is forwarded. The destination will then echo any marks back to the sender as an explicit congestion signal in its next reply packet. This is shown with a dashed line inthe figure toindicate that it happens abovethe IP level (e.g., in TCP). The sender must then throttle its transmissions, as in the case ofchokepackets. Packet Congested Marked router packet Host Host Congestionsignal Figure5-25. Explicitcongestionnotification Hop-by-Hop Backpressure At high speeds or over long distances, many new packets may be transmitted after congestion has been signaled because of the delay before the signal takes ef- fect. Consider, for example, a host in San Francisco (router A in Fig.5-26) that is sending traffic to a host in New York (router D in Fig. 5-26) at the OC-3 speed of 155Mbps. Ifthe New York hostbegins torunoutofbuffers, it willtake about40 msec for a choke packet to get back to San Francisco to tell it to slow down. An ECN indication will take even longer because it is delivered via the destination. Choke packet propagation is illustrated as the second, third, and fourth steps in SEC. 5.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL ALGORITHMS 401 Fig.5-26(a). In those 40msec, another 6.2 megabits will have been sent. Even if the host in San Francisco completely shuts downimmediately, the 6.2megabits in the pipe will continue to pour in and have to be dealt with. Only in the seventh diagram inFig.5-26(a)willtheNew Yorkrouter notice aslower flow. An alternative approach is to have the choke packet take effect at every hop it passes through, as shown in the sequence of Fig.5-26(b). Here, as soon as the choke packet reaches F, F is required to reduce the flow to D', 'Doing so will re- quire F to devote more buffers to the connection, since the source is still sending away at full blast, but it gives D immediate relief, like a headache remedy in a television commercial. In the next step, the chokepacket reachesE,which tells E to reduce the flow to F. This action puts a greater demand on E’s buffers but gives F immediate relief. Finally, the choke packet reaches A and the flow genuinely slowsdown. The neteffect ofthishop-by-hopscheme istoprovide quick relief at the point of congestion, at the price of using up more buffers upstream. In this way, con- gestion can be nipped in the bud without losing any packets. The idea is dis- cussed indetail byMishra etal.(1996). 5.3.5 Load Shedding When none of the above methods make the congestion disappear, routers can bring out the heavy artillery: load shedding. Load shedding is a fancy way of saying that when routers are being inundated by packets that they cannot handle, they just throw them away. The term comes from the world of electrical power generation, where it refers to the practice of utilities intentionally blacking out certain areas to save the entire grid from collapsing onhot summer days when the demand forelectricity greatly exceedsthe supply. The key question for a router drowning in packets is which packets to drop. The preferred choice may depend onthe type ofapplications that use the network. For a file transfer, an old packet is worth more than a new one. This is because dropping packet 6 and keeping packets 7 through 10, for example, will only force the receiver to do more work to buffer data that it cannot yet use. In contrast, for real-time media, a new packet is worth more than an old one. This is because packets become useless if they are delayed and miss the time at which they must beplayed outtotheuser. The former policy (old is better than new) is often called wine and the latter (new is better than old) is often called milk because most people would rather drinknewmilkandoldwine thanthealternative. More intelligent load shedding requires cooperation from the senders. An ex- ample is packets that carry routing information. These packets are more important than regular data packets because they establish routes; if they are lost, the net- work may lose connectivity. Another example is that algorithms for compressing video, like MPEG, periodically transmit an entire frame and then send subsequent 402 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 B C B C A D A D Heavyflow E F E F e e k k o o h h C C Choke Choke Reduced flow C C h h o o k k e e Reduced flow Flowisstill atmaximumrate Flowis reduced (a) (b) Figure5-26. (a)Achokepacketthataffectsonlythesource. (b)Achokepack- etthataffectseachhopitpassesthrough. SEC. 5.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL ALGORITHMS 403 frames as differences from the last full frame. In this case, dropping a packet that is part of a difference is preferable to dropping one that is part of a full frame be- cause futurepackets dependonthefullframe. Toimplement anintelligentdiscard policy, applications mustmarktheir pack- ets toindicate tothenetwork howimportant theyare', 'Then, whenpackets have to bediscarded, routers can first droppackets from the least important class, then the nextmostimportant class, andsoon. Of course, unless there is some significant incentive to avoid marking every packet as VERY IMPORTANT—NEVER, EVER DISCARD, nobody will do it. Often accounting and money are used to discourage frivolous marking. For ex- ample, the network might let senders send faster than the service they purchased allows if they mark excess packets as low priority. Such a strategy is actually not a bad idea because it makes more efficient use of idle resources, allowing hosts to use them as long as nobody else is interested, but without establishing a right to themwhentimes gettough. Random Early Detection Dealing with congestion when it first starts is more effective than letting it gum up the works and then trying to deal with it. This observation leads to an in- teresting twist on load shedding, which is to discard packets before all the buffer spaceisreally exhausted. The motivation for this idea is that most Internet hosts do not yet get conges- tion signals from routers in the form of ECN. Instead, the only reliable indication of congestion that hosts get from the network is packet loss. After all, it is diffi- cult to build a router that does not drop packets when it is overloaded. Transport protocols such as TCP are thus hardwired to react to loss as congestion, slowing down the source in response. The reasoning behind this logic is that TCP was de- signed for wired networks and wired networks are very reliable, so lost packets are mostly due to buffer overruns rather than transmission errors. Wireless links must recover transmission errors at the link layer (so they are not seen at the net- worklayer) toworkwell withTCP. This situation can be exploited to help reduce congestion. By having routers drop packets early, before the situation has become hopeless, there is time for the source to take action before it is too late. A popular algorithm for doing this is called RED (Random Early Detection) (Floyd and Jacobson, 1993). To deter- mine when to start discarding, routers maintain a running average of their queue lengths. When the average queue length on some link exceeds a threshold, the link is said to be congested and a small fraction of the packets are dropped at ran- dom. Picking packets at random makes it more likely that the fastest senders will see a packet drop; this is the best option since the router cannot tell which source is causing the most trouble in a datagram network. The affected sender will notice the loss when there is noacknowledgement, and then the transport protocol 404 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 will slow down. The lost packet is thus delivering the same message as a choke packet, butimplicitly,withouttherouter sendinganyexplicit signal. RED routers improve performance compared to routers that drop packets only when their buffers are full, though they may require tuning to work well', 'For ex- ample, the ideal number of packets to drop depends on how many senders need to be notified of congestion. However, ECN is the preferred option if it is available. It works in exactly the same manner, but delivers a congestion signal explicitly rather thanasaloss;REDisusedwhenhostscannotreceiveexplicit signals. 5.4 QUALITY OF SERVICE The techniques we looked at in the previous sections are designed to reduce congestion and improve network performance. However, there are applications (and customers) that demand stronger performance guarantees from the network than ‘‘the best that could be done under the circumstances.’’ Multimedia applica- tions in particular, often need a minimum throughput and maximum latency to work. In this section, we will continue our study of network performance, but now with a sharper focus on ways to provide quality of service that is matched to application needs. This is an area in which the Internet is undergoing a long-term upgrade. An easy solution to provide good quality of service is to build a network with enough capacity for whatever traffic will be thrown at it. The name for this solu- tion is overprovisioning. The resulting network will carry application traffic without significant loss and, assuming a decent routing scheme, will deliver pack- ets with low latency. Performance doesn’t get any better than this. To some extent, the telephonesystem isoverprovisioned becauseit israre topick upatele- phone and not get a dial tone instantly. There is simply so much capacity avail- able thatdemand can almost always bemet. The trouble with this solution is that it is expensive. It is basically solving a problem by throwing money at it. Quality of service mechanisms let a network with less capacity meet application requirements just as well at a lower cost. Moreover, overprovisioning is based on expected traffic. All bets are off if the traffic pattern changes too much. With quality of service mechanisms, the net- work can honor the performance guarantees that it makes even when traffic spikes, atthecostofturningdownsomerequests. Fourissues mustbeaddressed toensure qualityofservice: 1. What applications need fromthenetwork. 2. Howtoregulate thetraffic thatenters thenetwork. 3. Howtoreserve resources atrouters toguarantee performance. 4. Whether thenetwork cansafely acceptmore traffic. SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 405 No single technique deals efficiently with all these issues. Instead, a variety of techniques have been developed for use at the network (and transport) layer. Practical quality-of-service solutions combine multiple techniques. To this end, we will describe two versions of quality of service for the Internet called Integrated Services andDifferentiated Services. 5.4.1 Application Requirements A stream of packets from a source to a destination is called a flow (Clark, 1988). A flow might be all the packets of a connection in a connection-oriented network, or all the packets sent from one process to another process in a con- nectionless network. The needs of each flow can be characterized by four pri- mary parameters: bandwidth, delay, jitter,andloss. Together, these determine the QoS(Quality ofService)theflowrequires. Several common applications and the stringency of their network re- quirements are listed in Fig.5-27', 'Note that network requirements are less de- manding than application requirements in those cases that the application can im- prove onthe service provided bythe network. In particular, networks donotneed tobelossless forreliable file transfer, andtheydonotneedtodeliver packets with identical delays for audio and video playout. Some amount of loss can berepaired with retransmissions, and some amount of jitter can be smoothed by buffering packets at the receiver. However, there is nothing applications can do to remedy thesituation ifthenetwork providestoolittlebandwidth ortoomuchdelay. Application Bandwidth Delay Jitter Loss Email Low Low Low Medium Filesharing High Low Low Medium Webaccess Medium Medium Low Medium Remotelogin Low Medium Medium Medium Audioondemand Low Low High Low Videoondemand High Low High Low Telephony Low High High Low Videoconferencing High High High Low Figure5-27. Stringencyofapplications’quality-of-servicerequirements. The applications differ in their bandwidth needs, with email, audio in all forms, and remote login not needing much, but file sharing and video in all forms needing agreat deal. More interesting are the delay requirements. File transfer applications, in- cluding email and video, are not delay sensitive. If all packets are delayed uni- formly by a few seconds, no harm is done. Interactive applications, such as Web 406 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 surfing and remote login, are more delay sensitive. Real-time applications, such as telephony and videoconferencing, have strict delay requirements. If all the wordsina telephonecall are eachdelayed bytoolong,the users willfindthecon- nection unacceptable. On the other hand, playing audio or video files from a ser- verdoesnotrequire lowdelay. The variation (i.e., standard deviation) in the delay or packet arrival times is called jitter. The firstthree applications inFig. 5-27are notsensitivetothepack- ets arriving with irregular time intervals between them. Remote login is some- what sensitive to that, since updates on the screen will appear inlittle bursts if the connection suffers much jitter. Video and especially audio are extremely sensi- tive to jitter. If a user is watching a video over the network and the frames are all delayed by exactly 2.000 seconds, no harm is done. But if the transmission time varies randomly between 1 and 2seconds, the result will be terrible unless the ap- plication hides the jitter. For audio, a jitter of even a few milliseconds is clearly audible. The first four applications have more stringent requirements on loss than aud- io and video because all bits must be delivered correctly. This goal is usually a- chieved with retransmissions of packets that are lost in the network by the tran- sport layer. This iswasted work; it wouldbebetter ifthe network refused packets it was likely to lose in the first place. Audio and video applications can tolerate some lost packets without retransmission because people do not notice short pauses oroccasionalskippedframes. To accommodate a variety of applications, networks may support different categories of QoS. An influential example comes from ATM networks, which were once part of a grand vision for networking but have since become a niche technology. Theysupport: 1. Constant bitrate (e.g., telephony). 2. Real-time variable bitrate (e.g., compressed videoconferencing). 3. Non-real-time variable bitrate (e.g., watching amovieondemand). 4. Available bitrate (e.g., file transfer)', 'These categories are also useful for other purposes and other networks. Constant bit rate is an attempt to simulate a wire by providing a uniform bandwidth and a uniform delay. Variable bit rate occurs when video is compressed, with some frames compressing more than others. Sending a frame with a lot of detail in it may require sending many bits, whereas a shot of a white wall may compress ex- tremely well. Movies ondemand are notactually real timebecauseafew seconds of video can easily be buffered at the receiver before playback starts, so jitter on the network merely causes the amount of stored-but-not-played video to vary. Available bit rate is for applications such as email that are not sensitive to delay orjitterandwilltake what bandwidth theycan get. SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 407 5.4.2 Traffic Shaping Before the network can make QoS guarantees, it must know what traffic is being guaranteed. In the telephone network, this characterization is simple. For example, a voice call (in uncompressed format) needs 64kbpsand consists of one 8-bit sample every 125μsec. However, traffic indata networks isbursty. Ittypi- cally arrives at nonuniform rates as the traffic rate varies (e.g., videoconferencing with compression), users interact with applications (e.g., browsing a new Web page), and computers switch between tasks. Bursts of traffic are more difficult to handle than constant-rate traffic because they can fill buffers and cause packets to belost. Traffic shaping is a technique for regulating the average rate and burstiness of a flow of data that enters the network. The goal is to allow applications to transmit a wide variety of traffic that suits their needs, including some bursts, yet have a simple and useful way to describe the possible traffic patterns to the net- work. When a flow is set up, the user and the network (i.e., the customer and the provider) agree ona certain traffic pattern (i.e., shape) forthat flow. Ineffect, the customer says to the provider ‘‘My transmission pattern will look like this; can youhandle it?’’ Sometimes this agreement is called an SLA (Service Level Agreement), es- pecially when it is made over aggregate flows and long periods of time, such as all of the traffic for a given customer. As long as the customer fulfills her part of the bargain and only sends packets according to the agreed-on contract, the pro- vider promises todeliver themallinatimely fashion. Traffic shaping reduces congestion and thus helps the network live up to its promise. However, to make it work, there is also the issue of how the provider can tell if the customer is following the agreement and what to do if the customer isnot.Packets inexcess oftheagreed pattern mightbedroppedbythenetwork, or they might be marked as having lower priority. Monitoring atraffic flow is called traffic policing. Shaping and policing are not so important for peer-to-peer and other transfers that will consume any and all available bandwidth, but they are of great impor- tance for real-time data, such as audio and video connections, which have stringent quality-of-servicerequirements', 'Leaky and Token Buckets We have already seen one way to limit the amount of data an application sends: the sliding window, which uses one parameter to limit how much data is in transit at any given time, which indirectly limits the rate. Now we will look at a more general way to characterize traffic, with the leaky bucket and token bucket algorithms. Theformulations are slightlydifferent butgiveanequivalent result. 408 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Try to imagine a bucket with a small hole in the bottom, as illustrated in Fig.5-28(b).

Host Rate Packets Putin R water B Check Takeout bucket water/tokens B here Rate R Network (a) (b) (c) Figure5-28. (a)Shapingpackets.(b)Aleakybucket.(c)Atokenbucket. This bucket can be used to shape or police packets entering the network, as shown in Fig.5-28(a). Conceptually, each host is connected to the network by an interface containing a leaky bucket. To send a packet into the network, it must be possible to put more water into the bucket. If a packet arrives when the bucket is full, the packet must either be queued until enough water leaks outto hold it or be discarded. The former might happen at a host shaping its traffic for the network as part ofthe operating system. The latter might happen inhardware at a provider network interfacethat ispolicing traffic entering the network. This technique was proposedbyTurner (1986)andiscalled theleaky bucket algorithm. Adifferent butequivalent formulation istoimagine the network interface as a bucket that is being filled, as shown in Fig.5-28(c). The tap is running at rate R and the bucket has a capacity of B, as before. Now, to send a packet we must be able to take water, or tokens, as the contents are commonly called, out of the bucket (rather than putting water into the bucket). No more than a fixed number of tokens, B, can accumulate in the bucket, and if the bucket is empty, we must wait until more tokens arrive before we can send another packet. This algorithm iscalled thetoken bucket algorithm. Leaky and token buckets limit the long-term rate of a flow but allow short- term bursts up to a maximum regulated length to pass through unaltered and without suffering any artificial delays. Large bursts will be smoothed by a leaky bucket traffic shaper to reduce congestion in the network. As an example, imag- ine that a computer can produce data at up to 1000 Mbps (125 million bytes/sec) and that the first link of the network also runs at this speed. The pattern of traffic the host generates is shown in Fig.5-29(a). This pattern is bursty. The average SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 409 rate over one second is 200 Mbps, even though the host sends a burst of 16,000 KBatthetopspeed of1000Mbps(for1/8ofthesecond)', 'Rate(Mbps) Bucket(KB) 125MB/sfor 1000 125msec 16000 25MB/sfor 250msec (a) (d) WithR=25MB/s, B=9600KB 9600 Bucketempties, trafficdelayed (b) (e) WithR=25MB/s,B=0 Bucketalwaysempty 0 Time(msec) 1000 Time(msec) 1000 (c) (f) Figure5-29.

Now suppose that the routers can accept data at the top speed only for short intervals, until their buffers fill up. The buffer size is 9600 KB, smaller than the traffic burst. For long intervals, the routers work best at rates not exceeding 200 Mbps (say, because this is all the bandwidth given tothe customer). The implica- tion is that if traffic is sent in this pattern, some of it will be dropped in the net- workbecauseitdoesnotfitintothebuffers atrouters. To avoid this packet loss, we can shape the traffic at the host with a token bucket. If we use a rate, R, of 200Mbps and a capacity, B, of 9600KB, the traffic will fall within what the network can handle. The output of this token bucket is shown in Fig.5-29(b). The host can send full throttle at 1000 Mbps for a short while untilit has drained the bucket. Then it has to cut back to200Mbps until the burst has been sent. The effect is to spread out the burst over time because it was too large to handle all at once. The level of the token bucket is shown in Fig.5- 29(e). It starts off full and is depleted by the initial burst. When it reaches zero, new packets can be sent onlyat the rate at which the buffer is filling; there can be no more bursts until the bucket has recovered. The bucket fills when no traffic is beingsent andstaysflat whentraffic isbeingsentatthefillrate. We can also shape the traffic to be less bursty. Fig. 5-29(c) shows the output of a token bucket withR =200Mbpsanda capacity of0.This isthe extreme case 410 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 inwhich the traffic has been completely smoothed. No bursts are allowed, and the traffic enters the network at a steady rate. The corresponding bucket level, shown in Fig. 5-29(f), is always empty. Traffic is being queued on the host for release into the network and there is always a packet waiting to be sent when it is allow- ed. Finally, Fig.5-29(d) shows the bucket level for a token bucket with R =200 Mbpsanda capacity ofB =16,000KB. This isthe smallest tokenbucket through which the traffic passes unaltered. It might be used at a router in the network to police the traffic that the host sends. If the host is sending traffic that conforms to the token bucket on which it has agreed with the network, the traffic will fit through that same token bucket run at the router at the edge of the network. If the hostsends at afaster orburstier rate, the token bucket willrunoutofwater. If this happens, a traffic policer will know that the traffic is not as described. It will then either drop the excess packets or lower their priority, depending on the design of the network', 'In our example, the bucket empties only momentarily, at the end of theinitialburst,then recovers enoughforthenextburst. Leaky and token buckets are easy to implement. We will now describe the operation of a token bucket. Even though we have described water flowing con- tinuouslyintoandoutofthebucket, real implementations must workwith discrete quantities. A token bucket is implemented with a counter for the level of the bucket. The counter is advanced by R/ΔT units at every clock tick of ΔT seconds. This would be 200 Kbit every 1 msec in our example above. Every time a unit of traffic issentintothenetwork, thecounterisdecremented, andtraffic may be sent untilthecounterreacheszero. When the packets are all the same size, the bucket level can justbe countedin packets (e.g., 200 Mbit is 20 packets of 1250 bytes). However, often variable- sized packets are being used. In this case, the bucket level is counted in bytes. If theresidual bytecountistoolowtosendalarge packet, thepacket mustwait until thenexttick(oreven longer,ifthefillrate issmall). Calculating the length of the maximum burst (until the bucket empties) is slightly tricky. It is longer than just 9600 KB divided by 125 MB/sec because while the burst is being output, more tokens arrive. If we call the burst length S sec., the maximum outputrate Mbytes/sec, thetokenbucket capacity Bbytes, and the token arrival rate Rbytes/sec, we can see that an output burst contains a maxi- mum of B +RS bytes. We also know that the number of bytes in a maximum- speed burstoflengthSsecondsisMS. Hence, wehave B +RS =MS We can solvethisequation togetS =B/(M −R). Forourparameters ofB =9600 KB,M =125MB/sec, andR =25MB/sec, wegetabursttime ofabout94msec. A potential problem with the token bucket algorithm is that it reduces large bursts down to the long-term rate R. It is frequently desirable to reduce the peak rate, but without going down to the long-term rate (and also without raising the SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 411 long-term rate to allow more traffic into the network). One way to get smoother traffic is to insert a second token bucket after the first one. The rate of the second bucket shouldbemuch higher than the first one.Basically, thefirstbucket charac- terizes the traffic, fixing its average rate but allowing some bursts. The second bucket reduces the peak rate at which the bursts are sent intothenetwork. Forex- ample, if the rate ofthe secondtoken bucket isset tobe 500Mbps and the capaci- ty is set to 0, the initial burst will enter the network at a peak rate of 500 Mbps, whichislower thanthe1000Mbpsrate wehadpreviously. Usingallofthese buckets canbeabittricky. When tokenbuckets are used for traffic shaping at hosts, packets are queued and delayed until the buckets permit them to be sent. When token buckets are used for traffic policing at routers in the network, the algorithm is simulated to make sure that no more packets are sent than permitted. Nevertheless, these tools provide ways to shape the network traf- fic into more manageable forms to assist in meeting quality-of-service re- quirements. 5.4.3 Packet Scheduling Being able to regulate the shape of the offered traffic is a good start', 'Howev- er, to provide a performance guarantee, we must reserve sufficient resources along the route that the packets take through the network. To do this, we are as- sumingthatthepackets ofaflowfollow thesame route. Spraying themoverrout- ers at random makes it hard to guarantee anything. As a consequence, something similar to a virtual circuit has to be set up from the source to the destination, and allthepackets thatbelongtotheflowmustfollowthisroute. Algorithms that allocate router resources among the packets of a flow and be- tween competing flowsare called packet scheduling algorithms. Three different kindsofresources can potentially bereserved fordifferent flows: 1. Bandwidth. 2. Buffer space. 3. CPUcycles. The first one, bandwidth, is the most obvious. If a flow requires 1 Mbps and the outgoing line has a capacity of 2 Mbps, trying to direct three flows through that line is not going to work. Thus, reserving bandwidth means not oversubscribing anyoutputline. Asecondresource thatisoften inshortsupplyisbuffer space. When a packet arrives, it is buffered inside the router until it can be transmitted on the chosen outgoing line. The purpose of the buffer is to absorb small bursts of traffic as the flows contend with each other. If no buffer is available, the packet has to be dis- carded since there is no place to put it. For good quality of service, some buffers might be reserved for a specific flow so that flow does not have to compete for 412 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 buffers with other flows. Up to some maximum value, there will always be a bufferavailable whentheflowneeds one. Finally, CPU cycles may also be a scarce resource. It takes router CPU time to process a packet, so a router can process only a certain number of packets per second. While modern routers are able to process most packets quickly, some kinds of packets require greater CPU processing, such as the ICMP packets we willdescribe inSec. 5.6. Making surethatthe CPU isnotoverloaded isneeded to ensure timely processing ofthese packets. Packet scheduling algorithms allocate bandwidth and other router resources by determining which of the buffered packets to send on the output line next. We already described the most straightforward scheduler when explaining how rout- ers work. Each router buffers packets in a queue for each output line until they can be sent, and they are sent in the same order that they arrived. This algorithm is known as FIFO (First-In First-Out), or equivalently FCFS (First-Come First-Serve). FIFO routers usually drop newly arriving packets when the queue is full. Since the newly arrived packet would have been placed at the end of the queue, this behavior is called tail drop. It is intuitive, and you may be wondering what alternatives exist. In fact, the RED algorithm we described in Sec. 5.3.5 chose a newly arriving packet to drop at random when the average queue length grew large. The other scheduling algorithms that we will describe also create other opportunitiesfordeciding which packet todropwhenthebuffers are full', 'FIFO scheduling is simple toimplement, but it is not suited to providing good quality of service because when there are multiple flows, one flow can easily affect the performance of the other flows. If the first flow is aggressive and sends large bursts of packets, they will lodge in the queue. Processing packets in the order of their arrival means that the aggressive sender can hogmost of the capaci- ty of the routers its packets traverse, starving the other flows and reducing their quality of service. To add insult to injury, the packets of the other flows that do get through are likely to be delayed because they had to sit in the queue behind manypackets fromtheaggressive sender. Many packet scheduling algorithms have been devised that provide stronger isolation between flows andthwart attempts atinterference (BhattiandCrowcroft, 2000). One of the first ones was the fair queueing algorithm devised by Nagle (1987). The essence ofthis algorithm isthat routers have separate queues, onefor each flow for a given output line. When the line becomes idle, the router scans the queues round-robin,as showninFig.5-30. Itthen takes the first packet onthe next queue. Inthisway, with nhosts competing forthe outputline, each host gets to send one out of every n packets. It is fair in the sense that all flows get tosend packets atthesame rate. Sending more packets willnotimprove thisrate. Although a start, the algorithm has a flaw: it gives more bandwidth to hosts that use large packets than to hosts that use small packets. Demers et al. (1990) suggested an improvement in which the round-robin is done in such a way as to SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 413 1 2 Round-robin 3 2 1 3 2 1 service Outputline 3 Inputqueues Figure5-30. Round-robinfairqueueing. simulate a byte-by-byte round-robin, instead of a packet-by-packet round-robin. The trick is to compute a virtual time that is the number of the round at which each packet would finish being sent. Each round drains a byte from all of the queues that have data to send. The packets are then sorted in order of their fin- ishingtimes andsentinthatorder. This algorithm and an example of finish times for packets arriving in three flows are illustrated in Fig.5-31. If a packet has length L, the round at which it will finish is simply L rounds after the start time. The start time is either the fin- ish time of the previous packet, or the arrival time of the packet, if the queue is emptywhenitarrives.

(a)WeightedFairQueueing. (b)Finishingtimesforthepackets. From the table in Fig.5-32(b), and looking only at the first two packets in the top two queues, packets arrive in the order A, B, D, and F', 'Packet A arrives at round 0 and is 8 bytes long, so its finish time is round 8. Similarly the finish time for packet B is 11. Packet D arrives while B is being sent. Its finish time is 9 byte-rounds after it starts when B finishes, or 20. Similarly, the finish time for F is16. Inthe absence ofnew arrivals, therelative sendingorderisA,B,F,D,even thoughFarrived after D. Itispossiblethatanother small packet willarrive onthe top flow and obtain a finish time before D. It will only jump ahead of D if the 414 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 transmission of that packet has not started. Fair queueing does not preempt pack- ets that are currently being transmitted. Because packets are sent in their entirety, fair queueing is only an approximation of the ideal byte-by-byte scheme. But it is a very good approximation, staying within one packet transmission of the ideal scheme atalltimes. One shortcoming of this algorithm in practice is that it gives all hosts the same priority. In many situations, it is desirable to give, for example, video ser- vers more bandwidth than, say, file servers. This is easily possible by giving the video server two or more bytes per round. This modified algorithm is called WFQ (Weighted Fair Queueing). Letting the number of bytes per round be the weight ofaflow,W,wecan nowgivetheformula forcomputingthefinishtime: F i =max(A i ,F i−1 )+L i /W where A is the arrival time, F is the finish time, and L is the length of packet i. i i i The bottom queue of Fig.5-31(a) has a weight of 2, so its packets are sent more quicklyasyoucan see inthefinishtimes giveninFig.5-31(b). Another practical consideration is implementation complexity. WFQ requires that packets be inserted bytheir finishtime into asorted queue. With Nflows,this is at best an O(logN) operation per packet, which is difficult to achieve for many flows in high-speed routers. Shreedhar and Varghese (1995) describe an approxi- mation called deficit round robin that can be implemented very efficiently, with onlyO(1)operations perpacket. WFQ iswidely usedgiventhisapproximation. Other kinds of scheduling algorithms exist, too. A simple example is priority scheduling, in which each packet is marked with a priority. High-priority packets are always sent before any low-priority packets that are buffered. Within a prior- ity, packets are sent in FIFO order. However, priority scheduling has the disad- vantage thataburstofhigh-priority packets canstarve low-priority packets, which may have towait indefinitely. WFQ often provides a better alternative. Bygiving the high-priority queue a large weight, say 3, high-priority packets will often go through a short line (as relatively few packets should be high priority) yet some fraction of low priority packets will continue to be sent even when there is high priority traffic. A high and low priority system is essentially a two-queue WFQ system inwhichthehighpriorityhasinfinite weight. Asafinal example ofascheduler, packets might carry timestamps andbe sent in timestamp order. Clark et al. (1992) describe a design in which the timestamp records how far the packet is behind or ahead of schedule as it is sent through a sequence of routers on the path', 'Packets that have been queued behind other packets at a router will tend to be behind schedule, and the packets that have been serviced first will tend to be ahead of schedule. Sending packets in order of their timestamps has the beneficial effect of speeding up slow packets while at the same time slowing down fast packets. The result is that all packets are delivered bythenetwork withamoreconsistent delay. SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 415 5.4.4 Admission Control We have now seen all the necessary elements for QoS and it is time to put them together to actually provide it. QoS guarantees are established through the process ofadmission control. We first saw admission control used to control con- gestion, which is a performance guarantee, albeit a weak one. The guarantees we are considering now are stronger, but the model is the same. The user offers a flow with an accompanying QoS requirement to the network. The network then decides whether toacceptor reject the flow based onits capacity and the commit- ments it has made to other flows. If it accepts, the network reserves capacity in advance atrouters toguarantee QoSwhentraffic issent onthenewflow. The reservations must be made at all of the routers along the route that the packets take through the network. Any routers on the path without reservations mightbecome congested,andasinglecongestedroutercan break the QoS guaran- tee. Many routing algorithms find the single best path between each source and each destination and send all traffic over the best path. This may cause some flows tobe rejected ifthere isnotenoughspare capacity alongthe best path. QoS guarantees for new flows may still be accommodated by choosing a different route forthe flow that has excess capacity. Thisiscalled QoSrouting. Chenand Nahrstedt (1998) give an overview of these techniques. It is also possible to split the traffic for each destination over multiple paths to more easily find excess ca- pacity. A simple method is for routers to choose equal-cost paths and to divide the traffic equally orinproportiontothe capacity oftheoutgoinglinks. However, more sophisticatedalgorithms are alsoavailable (NelakuditiandZhang, 2002). Given a path, the decision to accept or reject a flow is not a simple matter of comparing the resources (bandwidth, buffers, cycles) requested by the flow with the router’s excess capacity in those three dimensions. It is a little more compli- cated than that. To start with, although some applications may know about their bandwidth requirements, few know about buffers or CPU cycles, so at the mini- mum, a different way is needed to describe flows and translate this description to router resources. We willgettothisshortly. Next, some applications are far more tolerant of an occasional missed dead- line than others. The applications must choose from the type of guarantees that the network can make, whether hard guarantees or behavior that will hold most of the time. All else being equal, everyone would like hard guarantees, but the diffi- culty is that they are expensive because they constrain worst case behavior. Guar- antees formostofthe packets are often sufficient forapplications, andmore flows withthisguarantee can besupportedforafixed capacity. Finally, someapplications maybewillingtohaggle aboutthe flow parameters and others may not', 'For example, a movie viewer that normally runs at 30 frames/sec may be willing to drop back to 25 frames/sec if there is not enough free bandwidth to support 30 frames/sec. Similarly, the number of pixels per frame, audiobandwidth, andotherproperties maybeadjustable. 416 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Becausemanyparties maybeinvolvedinthe flow negotiation (the sender, the receiver, and all the routers along the path between them), flows must be de- scribed accurately in terms of specific parameters that can be negotiated. A set of such parameters is called a flow specification. Typically, the sender (e.g., the video server) producesa flow specification proposingthe parameters it would like to use. As the specification propagates along the route, each router examines it and modifies the parameters as need be. The modifications can only reduce the flow, notincrease it (e.g., a lower data rate, nota higher one). When it gets tothe other end,theparameters can beestablished. Asanexample ofwhat can beina flow specification, consider the example of Fig.5-32. This is based on RFCs 2210 and 2211 for Integrated Services, a QoS design we will cover in the next section. It has five parameters. The first two pa- rameters, the token bucket rate and token bucket size, use a token bucket to give the maximum sustained rate the sender may transmit, averaged over a long time interval, andthelargest burstitcan sendoverashorttimeinterval. Parameter Unit Tokenbucketrate Bytes/sec Tokenbucketsize Bytes Peakdatarate Bytes/sec Minimumpacketsize Bytes Maximumpacketsize Bytes Figure5-32. Anexampleflowspecification. The third parameter, the peak data rate, is the maximum transmission rate tolerated, even for brief time intervals. The sender must never exceed this rate even forshortbursts. The last two parameters specify the minimum and maximum packet sizes, in- cluding the transport andnetwork layer headers (e.g., TCP andIP). Theminimum size is useful because processing each packet takes some fixed time, no matter how short. A router may be prepared to handle 10,000 packets/sec of 1 KB each, but not be prepared to handle 100,000 packets/sec of 50 bytes each, even though this represents a lower data rate. The maximum packet size is important due to internal network limitations that may notbe exceeded. For example, if part of the path goes over anEthernet, the maximum packet size willbe restricted tonomore than1500bytesnomatter whattherestofthenetwork can handle. An interesting question is how a router turns a flow specification into a set of specific resource reservations. At first glance, it might appear that if a router has a link that runs at, say, 1 Gbps and the average packet is 1000 bits, it can process 1 million packets/sec. This observation is notthe case, though, because there will always be idle periods on the link due to statistical fluctuations in the load. If the SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 417 link needs every bit of capacity to get its work done, idling for even a few bits creates abacklog itcannever getridof. Even with a load slightly below the theoretical capacity, queues can build up anddelays can occur. Consider a situation inwhichpackets arrive atrandomwith a mean arrival rate of λ packets/sec', 'The packets have random lengths and can be sent on the link with a mean service rate of μ packets/sec. Under the assumption that both the arrival and service distributions are Poisson distributions (what is called an M/M/1 queueing system, where ‘‘M’’ stands for Markov, i.e., Poisson), it can be proven using queueing theory that the mean delay experienced by a packet, T,is 1 1 1 1 T = × = × μ 1−λ/μ μ 1−ρ where ρ=λ/μ is the CPU utilization. The first factor, 1/μ, is what the service time would be in the absence of competition. The second factor is the slowdown dueto competition with other flows. For example, if λ=950,000packets/sec and μ=1,000,000 packets/sec, then ρ=0.95 and the mean delay experienced byeach packet will be 20 μsec instead of 1 μsec. This time accounts for both the queue- ing time and the service time, as can be seen when the load is very low (λ/μ∼∼0). If there are, say, 30 routers along the flow’s route, queueing delay alone will ac- countfor600μsec ofdelay. One methodof relating flow specifications to router resources that correspond to bandwidth and delay performance guarantees is given by Parekh and Gallagher (1993, 1994). It is based on traffic sources shaped by (R, B) token buckets and WFQ at routers. Each flow is given a WFQ weight W large enough to drain its tokenbucket rate RasshowninFig.5-33. For example, if the flow has arate of1 Mbps and the router and output link have a capacity of 1 Gbps, the weight for the flow must be greater than 1/1000th of the total of the weights for all of the flows at that router for the output link. This guarantees the flow a minimum bandwidth. Ifitcannotbegivenalarge enoughrate, theflowcannotbeadmitted. WxC R< w weights i W CapacityC (R,B) w i Trafficsource Weighted Router fairqueue Figure5-33. BandwidthanddelayguaranteeswithtokenbucketsandWFQ. The largest queueing delay the flow will see is a function of the burst size of the tokenbucket. Consider thetwoextreme cases. Ifthetraffic issmooth,without 418 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 any bursts, packets will be drained from the router just as quickly as they arrive. There will be no queueing delay (ignoring packetization effects). On the other hand, ifthe traffic issaved upinbursts, then a maximum-size burst, B, may arrive at the router all at once. In this case the maximum queueing delay, D, will be the time taken todrain this burstat the guaranteed bandwidth, or B/R (again, ignoring packetization effects). If this delay is too large, the flow must request more band- widthfromthenetwork. These guarantees are hard. The token buckets bound the burstiness of the source, and fair queueing isolates the bandwidth given to different flows. This means that the flow will meet its bandwidth and delay guarantees regardless of how the other competing flows behave at the router. Those other flows cannot break theguarantee even bysavinguptraffic andallsendingatonce. Moreover, the result holds for a path through multiple routers in any network topology. Each flow gets a minimum bandwidth because that bandwidth is guar- anteed at each router. The reason each flow gets a maximum delay is more sub- tle', 'In the worst case that a burst of traffic hits the first router and competes with the traffic of other flows, it will be delayed upto the maximum delay of D. How- ever, this delay will also smooth the burst. In turn, this means that the burst will incur no further queueing delays at later routers. The overall queueing delay will beatmostD. 5.4.5 Integrated Services Between 1995 and 1997, IETF put a lot of effort into devising an architecture for streaming multimedia. This work resulted in over two dozen RFCs, starting with RFCs 2205–2212. The generic name for this work is integrated services. It was aimed at both unicast and multicast applications. An example of the former is a single user streaming a video clip from a news site. An example of the latter is a collection of digital television stations broadcasting their programs as streams of IP packets to many receivers at various locations. Below we will concentrate onmulticast,since unicast isaspecial case ofmulticast. In many multicast applications, groups can change membership dynamically, for example, as people enter a video conference and then get bored and switch to asoap opera orthe croquetchannel. Under these conditions,the approach of hav- ing the senders reserve bandwidth in advance does not work well, since it would require each sender to track all entries and exits of its audience. For a system de- signedtotransmit television withmillionsofsubscribers, itwouldnotworkatall. RSVP—The ResourcereSerVation Protocol The main part ofthe integrated services architecture that isvisible tothe users of the network is RSVP. It is described in RFCs 2205–2210. This protocol is used for making the reservations; other protocols are used for sending the data. SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 419 RSVP allows multiple senders to transmit to multiple groups of receivers, permits individual receivers to switch channels freely, and optimizes bandwidth use while atthesame time eliminating congestion. In its simplest form, the protocol uses multicast routing using spanning trees, as discussed earlier. Each group is assigned a group address. To send to a group, asender putsthegroup’saddress initspackets. Thestandard multicastroutingal- gorithm then builds a spanning tree covering all group members. The routing al- gorithm is not part of RSVP. The only difference from normal multicasting is a little extra information that is multicast to the group periodically to tell the routers alongthetree tomaintain certain data structures intheir memories. Asanexample, consider the network ofFig. 5-34(a). Hosts 1and 2are multi- cast senders, and hosts 3, 4, and 5 are multicast receivers. In this example, the senders and receivers are disjoint, but in general, the two sets may overlap. The multicast trees for hosts 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 5-34(b) and Fig. 5-34(c), re- spectively. Senders 1 2 1 2 1 2 B B B A C A C A C D F D F D F E E E H H H G I G I G I K K K J L J L J L 3 4 5 3 4 5 3 4 5 Receivers (a) (b) (c) Figure5-34. (a)Anetwork.(b)Themulticastspanningtreeforhost1.

The message is propagated usingthereverse pathforwarding algorithm discussed earlier. Ateach 420 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 hop, the router notes the reservation and reserves the necessary bandwidth. We saw intheprevious section howaweighted fair queueing scheduler can beused to make this reservation. If insufficient bandwidth is available, it reports back failure. By the time the message gets back to the source, bandwidth has been re- served all the way from the sender to the receiver making the reservation request alongthespanningtree. An example of such a reservation is shown in Fig.5-35(a). Here host 3 has requested a channel to host 1. Once it has been established, packets can flow from 1 to 3 without congestion. Now consider what happens if host 3 next reserves a channel tothe other sender, host2,sothe user can watch twotelevision programs at once. A second path is reserved, as illustrated in Fig.5-35(b).

Finally, inFig. 5-35(c), host5decides towatch the program being transmitted by host 1 and also makes a reservation. First, dedicated bandwidth is reserved as farasrouter H. However, thisroutersees thatitalready hasafeed fromhost1,so if the necessary bandwidth has already been reserved, it does not have to reserve any more. Note that hosts 3 and 5 might have asked for different amounts of bandwidth (e.g., if host 3 is playing on a small screen and only wants the low- resolution information), so the capacity reserved must be large enough to satisfy thegreediest receiver. When making a reservation, a receiver can (optionally) specify one or more sources that it wants to receive from. It can also specify whether these choices SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 421 are fixed for the duration of the reservation or whether the receiver wants to keep open the option of changing sources later. The routers use this information to op- timize bandwidth planning. In particular, two receivers are only set up to share a pathiftheybothagree nottochange sources later on. The reason for this strategy in the fully dynamic case is that reserved band- width is decoupledfrom the choice of source. Once a receiver has reserved band- width, it can switch to another source and keep that portion of the existing path that is valid for the new source. If host 2 is transmitting several video streams in real time, for example a TV broadcaster with multiple channels, host 3 may switch between them at will without changing its reservation: the routers do not care whatprogram thereceiveriswatching', '5.4.6 Differentiated Services Flow-based algorithms have the potential to offer good quality of service to one or more flows because they reserve whatever resources are needed along the route. However, they also have a downside. They require anadvance setup toes- tablish each flow, something that does not scale well when there are thousands or millions of flows. Also, they maintain internal per-flow state in the routers, mak- ing them vulnerable to router crashes. Finally, the changes required to the router code are substantial and involvecomplex router-to-router exchanges forsettingup the flows. As a consequence, while work continues to advance integrated ser- vices, few deployments ofitoranythinglikeitexist yet. For these reasons, IETF has also devised a simpler approach to quality of ser- vice, one that can be largely implemented locally in each router without advance setup and without having the whole path involved. This approach is known as class-based (as opposed to flow-based) quality of service. IETF has standardized an architecture for it, called differentiated services, which is described in RFCs 2474,2475,andnumerousothers. We willnowdescribe it. Differentiated services can be offered by a set of routers forming an adminis- trative domain (e.g., anISP oratelco). The administration defines aset ofservice classes with corresponding forwarding rules. If a customer subscribes to dif- ferentiated services, customer packets entering the domain are marked with the class to which they belong. This information is carried in the Differentiated ser- vices field of IPv4 and IPv6 packets (described in Sec. 5.6). The classes are de- fined as per hop behaviors because they correspond to the treatment the packet will receive at each router, not a guarantee across the network. Better service is provided to packets with some per-hop behaviors (e.g., premium service) than to others (e.g., regular service). Traffic within a class may be required toconform to some specific shape, such as a leaky bucket with some specified drain rate. An operator with a nose for business might charge extra for each premium packet transported or might allow up to N premium packets per month for a fixed addi- tional monthly fee. Note that this scheme requires no advance setup, no resource 422 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 reservation, and no time-consuming end-to-end negotiation for each flow, as with integrated services. This makes differentiated services relatively easy to imple- ment. Class-based service also occurs in other industries. For example, package de- livery companies often offer overnight, two-day, and three-day service. Airlines offer first class, business class, and cattle-class service. Long-distance trains often have multiple service classes. Even the Paris subway has two different ser- vice classes. For packets, the classes may differ in terms of delay, jitter, and probability of being discarded in the event of congestion, among other possibili- ties (butprobably notroomier Ethernet frames). Tomake the difference between flow-based qualityof service and class-based quality of service clearer, consider an example: Internet telephony. With a flow- based scheme, each telephone call gets its own resources and guarantees. With a class-based scheme, all the telephone calls together get the resources reserved for the class telephony', 'These resources cannot be taken away by packets from the Web browsing class or other classes, but no telephone call gets any private re- sources reserved foritalone. Expedited Forwarding The choice of service classes is up to each operator, but since packets are often forwarded between networks run by different operators, IETF has defined some network-independent service classes. The simplest class is expedited for- warding,soletusstart withthatone. Itisdescribed inRFC 3246. The idea behind expedited forwarding is very simple. Two classes of service are available: regular and expedited. The vast majority of the traffic is expected to be regular, but a limited fraction of the packets are expedited. The expedited packets should be able to transit the network as though no other packets were present. In this way they will get low loss, low delay and low jitter service—just what is needed for VoIP. A symbolic representation of this ‘‘two-tube’’ system is given in Fig.5-36. Note that there is still just one physical line. The two logical pipes shown in the figure represent a way to reserve bandwidth for different classes ofservice, notasecondphysicalline. One way to implement this strategy is as follows. Packets are classified as expedited or regular and marked accordingly. This step might be done on the sending host or in the ingress (first) router. The advantage of doing classification on the sending host is that more information is available about which packets be- longtowhich flows. Thistask may be performed bynetworking software or even the operating system, to avoid having to change existing applications. For ex- ample, it is becoming common for VoIP packets to be marked for expedited ser- vice by hosts. If the packets pass through a corporate network or ISP that sup- ports expedited service, they will receive preferential treatment. If the network doesnotsupportexpedited service, noharm isdone. SEC. 5.4 QUALITYOFSERVICE 423 Expeditedpackets Regularpackets Figure5-36. Expeditedpacketsexperienceatraffic-freenetwork. Of course, if the marking is done by the host, the ingress router is likely to police the traffic tomake sure that customers are not sending more expedited traf- fic than they have paid for. Within the network, the routers may have two output queues foreachoutgoing line, one forexpedited packets andone forregular pack- ets. When a packet arrives, it is queued accordingly. The expedited queue is given priority over the regular one, for example, by using a priority scheduler. In this way, expedited packets see an unloaded network, even when there is, in fact, aheavy loadofregular traffic. Assured Forwarding Asomewhat more elaborate scheme formanaging the service classes is called assured forwarding. It is described in RFC 2597. Assured forwarding specifies that there shall be four priority classes, each class having its own resources. The top three classes might be called gold, silver, and bronze. In addition, it defines three discard classes for packets that are experiencing congestion: low, medium, andhigh. Taken together, these twofactors define 12service classes. Figure 5-37 shows one way packets might be processed under assured for- warding. The first step is to classify the packets into one of the four priority classes', 'As before, this step might be done on the sending host (as shown in the figure) or in the ingress router, and the rate of higher-priority packets may be lim- itedbytheoperator aspartoftheservice offering. The next step is to determine the discard class for each packet. This is done by passing the packets of each priority class through a traffic policer such as a token bucket. The policer lets all of the traffic through, but it identifies packets that fit within small bursts as low discard, packets that exceed small bursts as medium discard, andpackets that exceedlarge bursts as highdiscard. The combi- nationofpriorityanddiscard class isthenencoded ineachpacket. Finally, the packets are processed by routers in the network with a packet scheduler that distinguishes the different classes. A common choice is to use 424 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Packetswith DiffServmark Gold Silver Classifier Policer Bronze Packet source Four Twelve Weighted priority priority/drop fairqueues classes classes Router Figure5-37. Apossibleimplementationofassuredforwarding. weighted fair queueing for the four priority classes, with higher classes given higher weights. Inthisway, the higher classes willget most ofthe bandwidth, but the lower classes will not be starved of bandwidth entirely. For example, if the weights double from one class to the next higher class, the higher class will get twice the bandwidth. Within a priority class, packets with a higher discard class can be preferentially dropped by running an algorithm such as RED (Random Early Detection), which we saw in Sec. 5.3.5. RED will start to drop packets as congestion builds but before the router has run out of buffer space. At this stage, there isstillbuffer spacewith which to accept low discard packets while dropping highdiscard packets. 5.5 INTERNETWORKING Until now, we have implicitly assumed that there is a single homogeneous network, witheachmachine usingthesame protocol ineachlayer. Unfortunately, this assumption is wildly optimistic. Many different networks exist, including PANs, LANs, MANs, and WANs. We have described Ethernet, Internet over cable, the fixed and mobile telephone networks, 802.11, 802.16, and more. Num- erous protocols are in widespread use across these networks in every layer. In the following sections, we willtake a careful look at the issues that arise when two or more networks are connected to form an internetwork, or more simply an inter- net. It would be much simpler to join networks together if everyone used a single networking technology, and it is often the case that there is a dominant kind of network, suchasEthernet. Some punditsspeculate thatthemultiplicityoftechnol- ogies willgoaway as soonas everyonerealizes howwonderful[fillinyourfavor- ite network] is. Donotcountonit. History showsthis tobewishful thinking. Dif- ferent kinds of networks grapple with different problems, so, for example, Ether- net and satellite networks are always likely to differ. Reusing existing systems, such as running data networks on top of cable, the telephone network, and power SEC. 5.5 INTERNETWORKING 425 lines, adds constraints that cause the features of the networks to diverge. Hetero- geneity ishere tostay. If there will always be different networks, it would be simpler if we did not need to interconnect them. This also is unlikely', 'Bob Metcalfe postulated that the value of a network with N nodes is the number of connections that may be made between the nodes, or N2 (Gilder, 1993). This means that large networks are much more valuable than small networks because they allow many more con- nections, sothere always willbeanincentive tocombine smaller networks. The Internet is the prime example of this interconnection. (We will write In- ternet with a capital ‘‘I’’ to distinguish it from other internets, or connected net- works.) The purpose of joining all these networks is to allow users on any of them to communicate with users on all the other ones. When you pay an ISP for Internet service, youmaybecharged depending onthebandwidth ofyourline, but what you are really paying for is the ability to exchange packets with any other hostthat isalso connectedto the Internet. After all, the Internet would not be very popularifyoucouldonlysendpackets toother hostsinthesame city. Since networks often differ in important ways, getting packets from one net- work to another is not always so easy. We must address problems of hetero- geneity, and also problems of scale as the resultinginternet grows very large. We will begin by looking at how networks can differ to see what we are up against. Then we shall see the approach used so successfully by IP (Internet Protocol), the network layer protocol of the Internet, including techniques for tunneling through networks, routingininternetworks, andpacket fragmentation. 5.5.1 How Networks Differ Networks can differ inmany ways. Some of the differences, such as different modulation techniques or frame formats, are internal to the physical and data link layers. These differences will not concern us here. Instead, in Fig.5-38 we list some of the differences that can be exposed to the network layer. It is papering over these differences that makes internetworking more difficult than operating within asingle network. When packets sent by a source on one network must transit one or more for- eign networks before reaching the destination network, many problems can occur at the interfaces between networks. To start with, the source needs to be able to address the destination. What do we do if the source is on an Ethernet network and the destination is on a WiMAX network? Assuming we can even specify a WiMAX destination from an Ethernet network, packets would cross from a con- nectionless network to a connection-oriented one. This may require that a new connection be set up on short notice, which injects a delay, and much overhead if theconnectionisnotusedformanymore packets. Many specific differences may have to be accommodated as well. How do we multicast a packet to a group with some members on a network that does not 426 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Item SomePossibilities Serviceoffered Connectionlessversusconnectionoriented Addressing Differentsizes,flatorhierarchical Broadcasting Presentorabsent(alsomulticast) Packetsize Everynetworkhasitsownmaximum Ordering Orderedandunordereddelivery Qualityofservice Presentorabsent;manydifferentkinds Reliability Differentlevelsofloss Security Privacyrules,encryption,etc. Parameters Differenttimeouts,flowspecifications,etc. Accounting Byconnecttime,packet,byte,ornotatall Figure5-38. Someofthemanywaysnetworkscandiffer. support multicast? The differing max packet sizes used by different networks can be a major nuisance, too', 'How do you pass an 8000-byte packet through a net- work whose maximum size is 1500 bytes? If packets on a connection-oriented network transit aconnectionlessnetwork, they may arrive ina different order than they were sent. That is something the sender likely did not expect, and it might come asan(unpleasant)surprise tothereceiveraswell. These kinds of differences can be papered over, with some effort. For ex- ample, a gateway joining two networks might generate separate packets for each destination in lieu of better network support for multicasting. A large packet might be broken up, sent in pieces, and then joined back together. Receivers mightbufferpackets anddeliver theminorder. Networks also can differ in large respects that are more difficult to reconcile. The clearest example is qualityof service. If one network has strongQoS and the other offers best effort service, it will be impossible to make bandwidth and delay guarantees for real-time traffic end to end. In fact, they can likely only be made while the best-effort network is operated at a low utilization, or hardly used, which is unlikely to be the goal of most ISPs. Security mechanisms are prob- lematic, but at least encryption for confidentiality and data integrity can be lay- ered on top of networks that do not already include it. Finally, differences in ac- counting can lead to unwelcome bills when normal usage suddenly becomes ex- pensive, asroaming mobilephoneusers withdata planshave discovered. 5.5.2 How Networks Can Be Connected There are two basic choices for connecting different networks: we can build devices that translate or convert packets from each kind of network into packets for each other network, or, like good computer scientists, we can try to solve the SEC. 5.5 INTERNETWORKING 427 problem by adding a layer of indirection and building a common layer on top of the different networks. Ineither case, the devices are placed at the boundaries be- tween networks. Early on, Cerf and Kahn (1974) argued for a common layer to hide the dif- ferences of existing networks. This approach has been tremendously successful, and the layer they proposed was eventually separated into the TCP and IP proto- cols. Almost four decades later, IP is the foundation of the modern Internet. For thisaccomplishment,Cerf andKahn were awarded the 2004Turing Award, infor- mally known as the Nobel Prize of computer science. IP provides a universal packet format that all routers recognize and that can be passed through almost every network. IP has extended its reach from computer networks to take over the telephone network. It also runs on sensor networks and other tiny devices that were once presumed tooresource-constrained tosupportit. We have discussed several different devices that connect networks, including repeaters, hubs, switches, bridges, routers, and gateways. Repeaters and hubs just move bits from one wire to another. They are mostly analog devices and do not understand anything about higher layer protocols. Bridges and switches operate at the link layer. They can be used to build networks, but only with minor protocol translation in the process, for example, between 10, 100 and 1000 Mbps Ethernet switches', 'Our focus in this section is interconnection devices that operate at the network layer, namely the routers. We will leave gateways, which are higher- layer interconnectiondevices, untillater. Let us first explore at a high level how interconnection with a common net- work layer can be used to interconnect dissimilar networks. An internet comprised of 802.11, MPLS, and Ethernet networks is shown in Fig. 5-39(a). Suppose that the source machine on the 802.11 network wants to send a packet to the destination machine onthe Ethernet network. Since these technologies are dif- ferent, and they are further separated by another kind of network (MPLS), some added processing isneeded attheboundariesbetween thenetworks. Because different networks may, in general, have different forms of ad- dressing, the packet carries a network layer address that can identify any host a- cross the three networks. The first boundary the packet reaches is when it tran- sitions from an 802.11 network to an MPLS network. 802.11 provides a con- nectionless service, butMPLS provides aconnection-orientedservice. This means that a virtual circuit must be set up to cross that network. Once the packet has traveled along the virtual circuit, it will reach the Ethernet network. At this boundary, the packet may be too large to be carried, since 802.11 can work with larger frames than Ethernet. To handle this problem, the packet is divided into fragments, and each fragment is sent separately. When the fragments reach the destination, theyare reassembled. Thenthepacket hascompleted itsjourney. The protocol processing for this journey is shown in Fig. 5-39(b). The source acceptsdata fromthe transport layer and generates apacket withthecommonnet- work layer header, which is IP in this example. The network header contains the 428 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Packet Virtualcircuit 802.11 MPLS Ethernet Source Router Router Destination (a) Datafrom transportlayer IP IP IP IP 802.11IP 802.11IP MPLSIP MPLSIP Eth IP Eth IP Physical (b) Figure5-39. (a) A packet crossing different networks. (b) Network and link layerprotocolprocessing. ultimate destination address, which is used to determine that the packet should be sent via the first router. So the packet is encapsulated in an 802.11 frame whose destination isthe first router and transmitted. At the router, the packet is removed from the frame’s data field and the 802.11 frame header is discarded. The router now examines the IP address in the packet and looks up this address in its routing table. Based on this address, it decides to send the packet to the second router next. For this part of the path, an MPLS virtual circuit must be established to the second router and the packet must be encapsulated with MPLS headers that travel this circuit. At the far end, the MPLS header is discarded and the network address is again consulted to find the next network layer hop. It is the destination itself. Since the packet is too long to be sent over Ethernet, it is split into two portions. Each of these portions is put into the data field of an Ethernet frame and sent to the Ethernet address of the destination', 'At the destination, the Ethernet header is stripped from each of the frames, and the contents are reassembled. The packet hasfinally reacheditsdestination. Observe that there is an essential difference between the routed case and the switched (or bridged) case. With a router, the packet is extracted from the frame and the network address in the packet is used for deciding where to send it. With a switch (or bridge), the entire frame is transported on the basis of its MAC ad- dress. Switches do not have to understand the network layer protocol being used toswitch packets. Routers do. Unfortunately, internetworking is not as easy as we have made it sound. In fact, when bridges were introduced, it was intended that they would join different types of networks, or at least different types of LANs. They were to do this by translating frames from one LAN into frames from another LAN. However, this SEC. 5.5 INTERNETWORKING 429 did not work well, for the same reason that internetworking is difficult: the dif- ferences in the features of LANs, such as different maximum packet sizes and LANs with and without priority classes, are hard to mask. Today, bridges are predominantly used to connect the same kind of network at the link layer, and routers connectdifferent networks atthenetwork layer. Internetworking has been very successful at building large networks, but it only works when there is a common network layer. There have, in fact, been many network protocols over time. Gettingeverybodytoagree ona single format is difficult when companies perceive it to their commercial advantage to have a proprietary format that they control. Examples besides IP, which is now the near-universal network protocol, were IPX, SNA, and AppleTalk. None of these protocols are stillinwidespread use,butthere willalways beother protocols. The most relevant example now is probably IPv4 and IPv6. While these are both ver- sions ofIP, they are not compatible (or it would not have been necessary tocreate IPv6). A router that can handle multiple network protocols is called a multiprotocol router. It must either translate the protocols, or leave connection for a higher protocol layer. Neither approach is entirely satisfactory. Connection at a higher layer, say, by using TCP, requires that all the networks implement TCP (which may notbethe case). Then, itlimits usage across the networks toapplications that useTCP (which doesnotinclude manyreal-time applications). The alternative istotranslate packets between the networks. However, unless the packet formats are close relatives with the same information fields, such conversionswillalways beincomplete and often doomed to failure. For example, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long. They will not fit in a 32-bit IPv4 address field, no matter how hard the router tries. Getting IPv4 and IPv6 to run in the same net- work has proven to be a major obstacle to the deployment of IPv6. (To befair, so has getting customers tounderstand why they should want IPv6 inthe first place.) Greater problems can be expected when translating between fundamentally dif- ferent protocols, such as connectionless and connection-oriented network proto- cols. Given these difficulties, conversion is only rarely attempted', 'Arguably, even IP has only worked so well by serving as a kind of lowest common denomi- nator. It requires little of the networks on which it runs, butoffers onlybest-effort service asaresult. 5.5.3 Tunneling Handling the general case of making two different networks interwork is exceedingly difficult. However, there is a common special case that is man- ageable even for different network protocols. This case is where the source and destination hosts are on the same type of network, but there is a different network in between. As an example, think of an international bank with an IPv6 network 430 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 in Paris, an IPv6 network in London and connectivity between the offices via the IPv4Internet. Thissituation isshowninFig. 5-40. IPv6 IPv4 IPv6 Paris Router Router London Tunnel IPv6packet IPv4IPv6packet IPv6packet Figure5-40. TunnelingapacketfromParistoLondon. The solution to this problem is a technique called tunneling. To send an IP packet to a host in the London office, a host in the Paris office constructs the packet containing an IPv6 address in London, and sends it to the multiprotocol router that connects the Paris IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet. When this router gets the IPv6 packet, it encapsulates the packet with an IPv4 header addressed to the IPv4 side of the multiprotocol router that connects to the London IPv6 net- work. That is, the router puts a (IPv6) packet inside a (IPv4) packet. When this wrapped packet arrives, the London router removes the original IPv6 packet and sendsitonward tothedestination host. The path through the IPv4 Internet can be seen as a big tunnel extending from one multiprotocol router to the other. The IPv6 packet just travels from one end of the tunnel to the other, snug in its nice box. It does not have to worry about dealing with IPv4 at all. Neither dothe hosts in Paris or London. Only the multi- protocol routers have to understand both IPv4 and IPv6 packets. In effect, the en- tire tripfromonemultiprotocolroutertotheother islikeahopoverasingle link. An analogy may make tunneling clearer. Consider a person driving her car from Paris to London. Within France, the car moves under its own power, but when it hits the English Channel, it is loaded onto a high-speed train and tran- sported to England through the Chunnel (cars are not permitted to drive through the Chunnel). Effectively, the car is being carried as freight, as depicted in Fig.5-41. At the far end, the car is let loose on the English roads and once again continues to move under its own power. Tunneling of packets through a foreign network worksthesame way. Tunneling is widely used to connect isolated hosts and networks using other networks. The network that results is called an overlay since it has effectively been overlaid onthe base network. Deployment ofa network protocol with a new feature is a common reason, as our ‘‘IPv6 over IPv4’’ example shows. The disad- vantage of tunneling is that none of the hosts on the network that is tunneled over can be reached because the packets cannot escape in the middle of the tunnel. SEC', '5.5 INTERNETWORKING 431 Car EnglishChannel Paris London Railroadcarriage Railroadtrack Figure5-41. TunnelingacarfromFrancetoEngland. However, this limitation of tunnels is turned into an advantage with VPNs (Vir- tual Private Networks). A VPN is simply an overlay that is used to provide a measure ofsecurity. We willexplore VPNs whenwegettoChap. 8. 5.5.4 Internetwork Routing Routing through an internet poses the same basic problem as routing within a single network, but with some added complications. To start, the networks may internally use different routing algorithms. For example, one network may use link state routing and another distance vector routing. Since link state algorithms need to know the topology but distance vector algorithms do not, this difference alone wouldmake itunclear howtofindtheshortest pathsacross theinternet. Networks run by different operators lead to bigger problems. First, the opera- tors may have different ideas about what isa goodpath throughthe network. One operator may want the route with the least delay, while another may want the most inexpensive route. This will lead the operators to use different quantities to set the shortest-path costs (e.g., milliseconds of delay vs. monetary cost). The weights will not be comparable across networks, so shortest paths on the internet willnotbewell defined. Worse yet, one operator may not want another operator to even know the de- tails ofthepathsinitsnetwork, perhaps becausetheweights andpathsmayreflect sensitive information (such as the monetary cost) that represents a competitive business advantage. Finally, the internet may be much larger than any of the networks that comprise it. It may therefore require routing algorithms that scale well by using a hierarchy, evenifnoneoftheindividual networks need touseahierarchy. All ofthese considerations lead to a two-level routing algorithm. Within each network, an intradomain or interior gateway protocol is used for routing. (‘‘Gateway’’ is an older term for ‘‘router.’’) It might be a link state protocol of the kind we have already described. Across the networks that make up the internet, an interdomain or exterior gateway protocol is used. The networks may all use different intradomain protocols, but they must use the same interdomain protocol. 432 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 In the Internet, the interdomain routing protocol is called BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). We willdescribe itinthenextsection. There is one more important term to introduce. Since each network is oper- ated independently of all the others, it is often referred to as an AS (Autonomous System). A good mental model for an AS is an ISP network. In fact, an ISP net- work may be comprised of more than one AS, if it is managed, or, has been ac- quired, asmultiplenetworks. Butthedifference isusually notsignificant. The two levels are usually notstrictly hierarchical, as highly suboptimal paths might result if a large international network and a small regional network were both abstracted to be a single network. However, relatively little information about routes within the networks isexposedtofindroutes across the internetwork. This helps to address all of the complications. It improves scaling and lets opera- tors freely select routes within their own networks using a protocol oftheir choos- ing. It also does not require weights to be compared across networks or expose sensitiveinformation outside ofnetworks', 'However, we have said little so far about how the routes across the networks of the internet are determined. In the Internet, a large determining factor is the business arrangements between ISPs. Each ISP may charge or receive money from the other ISPs for carrying traffic. Another factor is that if internetwork routing requires crossing international boundaries, various laws may suddenly come into play, such as Sweden’s strict privacy laws about exporting personal data about Swedish citizens from Sweden. All of these nontechnical factors are wrapped up in the concept of a routing policy that governs the way autonomous networks select the routes that they use. We will return to routing policies when wedescribe BGP. 5.5.5 Packet Fragmentation Each network or link imposes some maximum size on its packets. These lim- itshave variouscauses, amongthem 1. Hardware (e.g., thesize ofanEthernet frame). 2. Operating system (e.g., allbuffers are 512bytes). 3. Protocols (e.g., thenumber ofbitsinthepacket lengthfield). 4. Compliance withsome(inter)national standard. 5. Desire toreduce error-inducedretransmissions tosomelevel. 6. Desire toprevent onepacket fromoccupyingthechannel toolong. The result of all these factors is that the network designers are not free to choose any old maximum packet size they wish. Maximum payloads for some common SEC. 5.5 INTERNETWORKING 433 technologies are 1500 bytes for Ethernet and 2272 bytes for 802.11. IP is more generous, allows forpackets asbigas65,515bytes. Hosts usually prefer to transmit large packets because this reduces packet overheads such as bandwidth wasted on header bytes. An obvious internetwork- ingproblem appears when alarge packet wants totravel through a network whose maximum packet size is too small. This nuisance has been a persistent issue, and solutionstoithaveevolved alongwithmuchexperience gained ontheInternet. One solution is to make sure the problem does not occur in the first place. However, this is easier said than done. A source does not usually know the path a packet will take through the network to a destination, so it certainly does not know how small packets must be to get there. This packet size is called the Path MTU (Path Maximum Transmission Unit). Even if the source did know the path MTU, packets are routed independently in a connectionless network such as the Internet. This routing means that paths may suddenly change, which can unexpectedly change thepathMTU. The alternative solution to the problem is to allow routers to break up packets into fragments, sending each fragment as a separate network layer packet. How- ever, as every parent of a small child knows, converting a large object into small fragments is considerably easier than the reverse process. (Physicists have even given this effect a name: the second law of thermodynamics.) Packet-switching networks, too,have troubleputtingthefragments backtogether again. Two opposing strategies exist for recombining the fragments back into the original packet. The first strategy is to make fragmentation caused by a ‘‘small- packet’’ network transparent to any subsequent networks through which the pack- et must pass on its way to the ultimate destination. This option is shown in Fig.5- 42(a). In this approach, when an oversized packet arrives at G1, the router breaks it up into fragments', 'Each fragment is addressed to the same exit router, G2, where the pieces are recombined. In this way, passage through the small-packet network is made transparent. Subsequent networks are not even aware that frag- mentation hasoccurred. Transparent fragmentation is straightforward but has some problems. For one thing, the exit router must know when it has received all the pieces, so either a count field or an ‘‘end of packet’’ bit must be provided. Also, because all packets must exit via the same router so that they can be reassembled, the routes are con- strained. By not allowing some fragments tofollow one route to the ultimate dest- ination and other fragments adisjoint route, some performance may belost. More significant is the amount of work that the router may have to do. It may need to buffer the fragments as they arrive, anddecide when tothrow them away ifnotall of the fragments arrive. Some of this work may be wasteful, too, as the packet may pass through a series of small packet networks and need to be repeatedly fragmented andreassembled. The other fragmentation strategy is to refrain from recombining fragments at any intermediate routers. Once a packet has been fragmented, each fragment is 434 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Network1 Network2 Packet G G G G 1 2 3 4 G 2 G 4 G 1 fragments reassembles G 3 fragments reassembles alargepacket thefragments again again (a) Packet G G G G 1 2 3 4 G fragments Thefragmentsarenotreassembled 1 alargepacket untilthefinaldestination(ahost)isreached (b) Figure5-42.

The routers pass the fragments, as showninFig.5-42(b), andreassembly isperformed onlyatthedestination host. The main advantage of nontransparent fragmentation is that it requires routers todoless work. IP works thisway. Acomplete designrequires thatthefragments be numbered in such a way that the original data stream can be reconstructed. The design used by IP is to give every fragment a packet number (carried on all packets), anabsolute byteoffset withinthepacket, anda flag indicating whether it is the end of the packet. An example is shown in Fig. 5-43. While simple, this design has some attractive properties. Fragments can be placed in a buffer at the destination in the right place for reassembly, even if they arrive out of order. Fragments can also be fragmented if they pass over a network with a yet smaller MTU. This is shown in Fig. 5-43(c). Retransmissions of the packet (if all frag- ments were not received) can be fragmented into different pieces. Finally, frag- ments can be of arbitrary size, down to a single byte plus the packet header. In all cases, the destination simply uses the packet number and fragment offset to place the data in the right position, and the end-of-packet flag to determine when it has thecomplete packet. Unfortunately, this design still has problems. The overhead can be higher than with transparent fragmentation because fragment headers are now carried over some links where they may not be needed. But the real problem is the exist- ence of fragments in the first place', 'Kent and Mogul (1987) argued that frag- mentation is detrimental to performance because, as well as the header overheads, awhole packet islostifanyofitsfragments are lost,andbecausefragmentation is more ofaburdenforhoststhanwas originally realized.

The process is called path MTU discovery (MogulandDeering, 1990). Itworksas follows. Each IP packet is sent with its header bits set to indicate that no fragmentation is allowed to be performed. If a router receives a packet that is too large, it generates an error packet, returns it to the source, and drops the packet. This is shown in Fig.5-44. When the source receivesthe error packet, ituses the information inside torefrag- ment the packet into pieces that are small enough for the router to handle. If a router further downthepathhasaneven smaller MTU,theprocess isrepeated. Packet(withlength) 1400 1200 900 Source Destination “Try1200” “Try900” Figure5-44. PathMTUdiscovery. 436 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 The advantage of path MTU discovery is that the source now knows what length packet to send. If the routes and path MTU change, new error packets will be triggered and the source will adapt to the new path. However, fragmentation is still needed between the source and the destination unless the higher layers learn the path MTU and pass the right amount of data to IP. TCP and IP are typically implemented together (as ‘‘TCP/IP’’) to be able to pass this sort of information. Even ifthisisnotdoneforother protocols, fragmentation has stillbeen moved out ofthenetwork andintothehosts. The disadvantage of path MTU discovery is that there may be added startup delays simply to send a packet. More than one round-trip delay may be needed to probe the path and find the MTU before any data is delivered to the destination. This begs the question of whether there are better designs. The answer is proba- bly‘‘Yes.’’Consider the design inwhich eachrouter simply truncates packets that exceedits MTU. Thiswouldensure that the destination learns the MTUasrapidly as possible (from the amount of data that was delivered) and receives some of the data. 5.6 THE NETWORK LAYER IN THE INTERNET It is now time to discuss the network layer of the Internet in detail. But before getting into specifics, it is worth taking a look at the principles that drove its de- sign in the past and made it the success that it is today. All too often, nowadays, people seem to have forgotten them. These principles are enumerated and dis- cussed inRFC 1958,which iswell worthreading (andshouldbemandatory forall protocol designers—with a final exam at the end)', 'This RFC draws heavily on ideas putforth byClark (1988)and Saltzer et al. (1984). We willnow summarize what we consider to be the top 10 principles (from most important to least impor- tant). 1. Make sure it works. Do not finalize the design or standard until multiple prototypes have successfully communicated with each other. Alltoooften, designers first write a 1000-page standard, get it approved, then discover it is deeply flawed and does not work. Then theywrite version1.1ofthestandard. Thisisnotthewaytogo. 2. Keep it simple. When in doubt, use the simplest solution. William of Occam stated this principle (Occam’s razor) in the 14th century. Put in modern terms: fight features. If a feature is not absolutely es- sential, leave it out, especially if the same effect can be achieved by combining otherfeatures. 3. Make clear choices. If there are several ways of doing the same thing, choose one. Having two or more ways to do the same thing is looking for trouble. Standards often have multiple options or modes SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 437 orparameters becauseseveral powerful parties insistthattheir wayis best. Designers shouldstronglyresist thistendency. Justsayno. 4. Exploit modularity. This principle leads directly to the idea of hav- ing protocol stacks, each of whose layers is independent of all the other ones. Inthisway, ifcircumstances require onemoduleorlayer tobechanged, theother oneswillnotbeaffected. 5. Expect heterogeneity. Different types of hardware, transmission facilities, and applications will occur on any large network. To handle them, the network design must be simple, general, and flexi- ble. 6. Avoid static options and parameters. If parameters are unavoid- able (e.g., maximum packet size), it isbest tohave the sender and re- ceiver negotiate avalue rather thandefining fixedchoices. 7. Look for a good design; it need not be perfect. Often, the de- signers have a good design but it cannot handle some weird special case. Rather than messing up the design, the designers should go with the good design and put the burden of working around it on the people withthestrange requirements. 8. Be strict when sending and tolerant when receiving. In other words, send only packets that rigorously comply with the standards, but expect incoming packets that may not be fully conformant and trytodeal withthem. 9. Think about scalability. If the system is to handle millions of hosts and billions of users effectively, nocentralized databases of any kind are tolerable and load must be spread as evenly as possible over the available resources. 10. Consider performance and cost. If a network has poor per- formance oroutrageous costs, nobodywilluseit. Let us now leave the general principles and start looking at the details of the Internet’s network layer. In the network layer, the Internet can be viewed as a collection of networks or ASes (Autonomous Systems) that are interconnected. There is no real structure, but several major backbones exist. These are con- structed from high-bandwidth lines and fast routers. The biggest of these back- bones, to which everyone else connects to reach the rest of the Internet, are called Tier 1 networks', 'Attached to the backbones are ISPs (Internet Service Pro- viders) that provide Internet access to homes and businesses, data centers and colocation facilities full of server machines, and regional (mid-level) networks. The data centers serve much of the content that is sent over the Internet. Attached 438 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 to the regional networks are more ISPs, LANs at many universities and com- panies, and other edge networks. A sketch of this quasihierarchical organization isgiveninFig.5-45. Leased Leasedlines AU.S.backbone transatlantic AEuropeanbackbone toAsia lines Mobile network National Regional network network WiMAX IProuter Company network Cable Home network Ethernet Figure5-45. TheInternetisaninterconnectedcollectionofmanynetworks. The glue that holds the whole Internet together is the network layer protocol, IP (Internet Protocol). Unlike most older network layer protocols, IP was de- signed from the beginning with internetworking in mind. A good way to think of the network layer is this: its job is to provide a best-effort (i.e., not guaranteed) way to transport packets from source to destination, without regard to whether these machines are on the same network or whether there are other networks in between them. Communication in the Internet works as follows. The transport layer takes data streams andbreaks themupsothattheymaybesentasIPpackets. Intheory, packets can be up to 64 KB each, but in practice they are usually not more than 1500 bytes (so they fit in one Ethernet frame). IP routers forward each packet through the Internet, alonga path from one router to the next, until the destination is reached. At the destination, the network layer hands the data to the transport layer, which gives it to the receiving process. When all the pieces finally get to the destination machine, they are reassembled by the network layer into the origi- naldatagram. Thisdatagram isthenhanded tothetransport layer. In the example of Fig.5-45, a packet originating at a host on the home net- work has to traverse four networks and a large number of IP routers before even getting to the company network on which the destination host is located. This is SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 439 not unusual in practice, and there are many longer paths. There is also much redundant connectivity in the Internet, with backbones and ISPs connecting to each other in multiple locations. This means that there are many possible paths between two hosts. It is the job of the IP routing protocols to decide which paths touse. 5.6.1 The IP Version 4Protocol An appropriate place to start our study of the network layer in the Internet is with the format of the IP datagrams themselves. An IPv4 datagram consists of a header part and a bodyor payload part. The header has a 20-byte fixed part and a variable-length optional part. The header format is shown in Fig.5-46. The bits are transmitted from left to right and top to bottom, with the high-order bit of the Version field going first. (This is a ‘‘big-endian’’ network byte order', 'On little- endian machines, such as Intel x86 computers, a software conversion is required on both transmission and reception.) In retrospect, little endian would have been a better choice, but at the time IP was designed, no one knew it would come to dominate computing. 32Bits Version IHL Differentiatedservices Totallength D M Identification Fragmentoffset F F Timetolive Protocol Headerchecksum Sourceaddress Destinationaddress Options(0ormorewords) Figure5-46. TheIPv4(InternetProtocol)header. The Version field keeps track of which version of the protocol the datagram belongs to. Version 4 dominates the Internet today, and that is where we have started our discussion. By including the version at the start of each datagram, it becomes possible tohave a transitionbetween versions overalongperiod oftime. In fact, IPv6, the next version of IP, was defined more than a decade ago, yet is only just beginning to be deployed. We will describe it later in this section. Its use will eventually be forced when each of China’s almost 231 people has a desk- top PC, a laptop, and an IP phone. As an aside onnumbering, IPv5 was an exper- imental real-time stream protocol thatwas never widely used. 440 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Since the header length is not constant, a field in the header, IHL, is provided to tell how long the header is, in 32-bit words. The minimum value is 5, which applies when nooptions are present. The maximum value of this 4-bit field is 15, which limits the header to 60 bytes, and thus the Options field to 40 bytes. For some options, such as one that records the route a packet has taken, 40bytes is far toosmall, makingthoseoptionsuseless. The Differentiated services field is one of the few fields that has changed its meaning (slightly) over the years. Originally, it was called the Type of service field. It was and still is intended to distinguish between different classes of ser- vice. Various combinations of reliability and speed are possible. For digitized voice, fast delivery beats accurate delivery. For file transfer, error-free transmis- sion is more important than fast transmission. The Type of service field provided 3bits tosignal priority and3bitstosignal whether a host cared more about delay, throughput,or reliability. However, noonereally knew what todowiththese bits at routers, so they were left unused for many years. When differentiated services were designed, IETF threw in the towel and reused this field. Now, the top 6 bits are used to mark the packet with its service class; we described the expedited and assured services earlier in this chapter. The bottom 2 bits are used to carry expli- cit congestion notification information, such as whether the packet has experi- enced congestion; we described explicit congestion notification as part of conges- tioncontrol earlier inthischapter. The Total length includes everything in the datagram—both header and data. The maximum length is 65,535 bytes. At present, this upper limit is tolerable, but withfuture networks, larger datagrams maybeneeded. The Identification field is needed to allow the destination host to determine which packet a newly arrived fragment belongs to. All the fragments of a packet contain thesame Identificationvalue', 'Next comes an unused bit, which is surprising, as available real estate in the IP header is extremely scarce. As an April Fool’s joke, Bellovin (2003) proposed using this bit to detect malicious traffic. This would greatly simplify security, as packets with the ‘‘evil’’bit set wouldbeknowntohave been sent byattackers and couldjustbediscarded. Unfortunately, network security isnotthissimple. Then come two 1-bit fields related to fragmentation. DF stands for Don’t Fragment. It is an order to the routers not to fragment the packet. Originally, it was intended to support hosts incapable of putting the pieces back together again. Now it is used as part of the process to discover the path MTU, which is the larg- est packet that can travel along a path without being fragmented. By marking the datagram withthe DF bit, the sender knowsitwilleither arrive inonepiece,oran errormessage willbereturned tothesender. MF stands for More Fragments. All fragments except the last one have this bitset. Itisneeded toknowwhenallfragments ofadatagram havearrived. The Fragment offset tells where in the current packet this fragment belongs. All fragments except the last one in a datagram must be a multiple of 8 bytes, the SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 441 elementary fragment unit. Since 13bitsare provided, there isamaximum of8192 fragments per datagram, supporting a maximum packet length up to the limit of the Total length field. Working together, the Identification, MF, and Fragment offset fields are usedtoimplement fragmentation asdescribed inSec. 5.5.5. The TtL (Time to live) field is a counter used to limit packet lifetimes. It was originally supposedtocounttime inseconds,allowing amaximum lifetime of255 sec. It must be decremented oneach hop and is supposed tobe decremented mul- tiple times when a packet is queued for a long time in a router. In practice, it just counts hops. When it hits zero, the packet is discarded and a warning packet is sent back to the source host. This feature prevents packets from wandering around forever, something that otherwise might happen if the routing tables ever become corrupted. When the network layer has assembled a complete packet, it needs to know what to do with it. The Protocol field tells it which transport process to give the packet to. TCP is one possibility, but so are UDP and some others. The num- bering ofprotocols isglobal across the entire Internet. Protocols andother assign- ednumberswere formerly listed inRFC1700,butnowadays theyare contained in anonlinedatabase located atwww.iana.org. Since the header carries vital information such as addresses, it rates its own checksum for protection, the Header checksum. The algorithm istoadd upall the 16-bit halfwords of the header as they arrive, using one’s complement arithmetic, and then take the one’s complement of the result. For purposes of this algorithm, the Header checksum is assumed to be zero upon arrival. Such a checksum is useful for detecting errors while the packet travels throughthe network. Note that it must be recomputed at each hop because at least one field always changes (the Time tolive field), buttricks canbeusedtospeed upthecomputation. The Source address and Destination address indicate the IP address of the source and destination network interfaces. We will discuss Internet addresses in thenextsection', 'The Options field was designed to provide an escape to allow subsequent ver- sions of the protocol to include information not present in the original design, to permit experimenters to try out new ideas, and to avoid allocating header bits to information that israrely needed. The options are ofvariable length. Each begins with a 1-byte code identifying the option. Some options are followed by a 1-byte option length field, and then one or more data bytes. The Options field is padded out to a multiple of 4 bytes. Originally, the five options listed in Fig.5-47 were defined. The Security option tells how secret the information is. In theory, a military router might use this field to specify not toroute packets throughcertain countries the military considers to be ‘‘bad guys.’’ In practice, all routers ignore it, so its onlypractical function istohelpspiesfindthegoodstuffmoreeasily. The Strict source routing option gives the complete path from source to desti- nation as a sequence of IP addresses. The datagram is required to follow that 442 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Option Description Security Specifieshowsecretthedatagramis Strictsourcerouting Givesthecompletepathtobefollowed Loosesourcerouting Givesalistofroutersnottobemissed Recordroute MakeseachrouterappenditsIPaddress Timestamp Makeseachrouterappenditsaddressandtimestamp Figure5-47. SomeoftheIPoptions. exact route. It is most useful for system managers who need to send emergency packets when the routing tables have been corrupted, or for making timing meas- urements. The Loose source routing option requires the packet to traverse the list of routers specified, in the order specified, but it is allowed to pass through other routers onthe way. Normally, thisoption willprovide onlya few routers, to force a particular path. For example, to force a packet from London to Sydney to go west instead of east, this option might specify routers in New York, Los Angeles, and Honolulu. This option is most useful when political or economic consid- erations dictate passingthroughoravoidingcertain countries. The Record route option tells each router along the path to append its IP ad- dress tothe Options field. Thisallows system managers totrack downbugsinthe routing algorithms (‘‘Why are packets from Houston to Dallas visiting Tokyo first?’’). When the ARPANET was first set up, no packet ever passed through more than nine routers, so 40 bytes of options was plenty. As mentioned above, nowitistoosmall. Finally, the Timestamp option is like the Record route option, except that in addition to recording its 32-bit IP address, each router also records a 32-bit time- stamp. Thisoption,too,ismostlyusefulfornetwork measurement. Today, IP options have fallen out of favor. Many routers ignore them or do notprocess them efficiently, shuntingthemtothesideasanuncommoncase. That is,theyare onlypartly supportedandtheyare rarely used. 5.6.2 IP Addresses A defining feature of IPv4 is its 32-bit addresses. Every host and router on the Internet has an IP address that can be used inthe Source addressand Destina- tion address fields of IP packets. It is important to note that an IP address does notactually refer toa host. Itreally refers toanetwork interface,soifahostison two networks, it must have two IP addresses. However, in practice, most hosts are on one network and thus have one IP address. In contrast, routers have multi- pleinterfacesandthusmultipleIPaddresses. SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 443 Prefixes IP addresses are hierarchical, unlike Ethernet addresses', 'Each 32-bit address iscomprised ofavariable-length network portion inthe topbitsandahostportion in the bottom bits. The network portion has the same value for all hosts on a sin- gle network, such as an Ethernet LAN. This means that a network corresponds to acontiguousblockofIPaddress space.Thisblockiscalled aprefix. IP addresses are written in dotted decimal notation. In this format, each of the 4 bytes is written in decimal, from 0 to 255. For example, the 32-bit hexade- cimal address 80D00297 is written as 128.208.2.151. Prefixes are written by giv- ing the lowest IP address in the block and the size of the block. The size is deter- mined by the number of bits in the network portion; the remaining bits in the host portion can vary. This means that the size must be a power of two. By conven- tion, it is written after the prefix IP address as a slash followed by the length in bits of the network portion. In our example, if the prefix contains 28 addresses andsoleaves 24bitsforthenetwork portion,itiswrittenas128.208.0.0/24. Since the prefix length cannot be inferred from the IP address alone, routing protocols must carry the prefixes to routers. Sometimes prefixes are simply de- scribed bytheir length, as in a ‘‘/16’’ which is pronounced ‘‘slash 16.’’ The length of the prefix corresponds to a binary mask of 1s in the network portion. When written out this way, it is called a subnet mask. It can be ANDed with the IP ad- dress to extract only the network portion. For our example, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. Fig.5-48showsaprefix andasubnetmask. 32bits Prefixlength=Lbits 32–Lbits Network Host Subnet mask 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Figure5-48. AnIPprefixandasubnetmask. Hierarchical addresses have significant advantages and disadvantages. The key advantage of prefixes is that routers can forward packets based on only the network portion of the address, as long as each of the networks has a unique ad- dress block. The host portion does not matter to the routers because all hosts on the same network will be sent in the same direction. It is only when the packets reach the network for which they are destined that they are forwarded to the cor- rect host. This makes the routing tables much smaller than they would otherwise be. Consider that the number of hosts on the Internet is approaching one billion. That would be a very large table for every router to keep. However, by using a hierarchy, routers need tokeep routes foronlyaround300,000prefixes. 444 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 While using a hierarchy lets Internet routing scale, it has two disadvantages. First, the IP address of a host depends on where it is located in the network. An Ethernet address can be used anywhere in the world, but every IP address belongs to a specific network, and routers will only be able to deliver packets destined to thataddress tothe network. Designs such as mobile IP are needed tosupporthosts thatmovebetween networks butwanttokeep thesame IPaddresses', 'The second disadvantage is that the hierarchy is wasteful of addresses unless it is carefully managed. If addresses are assigned to networks in (too) large blocks, there will be (many) addresses that are allocated but not in use. This al- location would not matter much if there were plenty of addresses to go around. However, it was realized more than two decades ago that the tremendous growth of the Internet was rapidly depleting the free address space. IPv6 is the solution to thisshortage, butuntilitiswidely deployed there willbegreat pressure toallocate IPaddresses sothattheyare usedveryefficiently. Subnets Network numbers are managed by a nonprofit corporation called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), to avoid conflicts. In turn, ICANN has delegated parts of the address space to various regional authorities, which dole out IP addresses to ISPs and other companies. This is the process bywhich acompany isallocated ablockofIPaddresses. However, this process is only the start of the story, as IP address assignment isongoingas companies grow. We have said that routing byprefix requires allthe hosts in a network to have the same network number. This property can cause problems as networks grow. For example, consider a university that started out with our example /16 prefix for use by the Computer Science Dept. for the com- puters on its Ethernet. A year later, the Electrical Engineering Dept. wants to get on the Internet. The Art Dept. soon follows suit. What IP addresses should these departments use? Getting further blocks requires going outside the university and may be expensive or inconvenient. Moreover, the /16 already allocated has enough addresses for over 60,000 hosts. It might be intended to allow for signifi- cant growth, but until that happens, it is wasteful to allocate further blocks of IP addresses tothesame university. Adifferent organization isrequired. The solution istoallow the block ofaddresses to be splitinto several parts for internal use as multiple networks, while still acting like a single network to the outside world. This is called subnetting and the networks (such as Ethernet LANs) that result from dividing up a larger network are called subnets. As we mentioned in Chap. 1, you should be aware that this new usage of the term con- flicts with older usage of ‘‘subnet’’ to mean the set of all routers and communica- tionlines inanetwork. Fig.5-49 shows how subnets can help with our example. The single /16 has been split into pieces. This split does not need to be even, but each piece must be SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 445 aligned so that any bits can be used in the lower host portion. In this case, half of the block (a /17) is allocated to the Computer Science Dept, a quarter is allocated tothe Electrical Engineering Dept. (a /18), andoneeighth (a /19)tothe Art Dept. The remaining eighth is unallocated.

SplittinganIPprefixintoseparatenetworkswithsubnetting. When a packet comes into the main router, how does the router know which subnet to give it to? This is where the details of our prefixes come in. One way would be for each router to have a table with 65,536 entries telling it which out- going line to use for each host on campus. But this would undermine the main scaling benefit we get from using a hierarchy. Instead, the routers simply need to knowthesubnetmasksforthenetworks oncampus. When a packet arrives, the router looks at the destination address of the pack- et and checks which subnet it belongs to. The router can do this by ANDing the destination address with the mask for each subnetand checking tosee if the result is the corresponding prefix. For example, consider a packet destined for IP ad- dress 128.208.2.151. To see if it is for the Computer Science Dept., we AND with 255.255.128.0 to take the first 17 bits (which is 128.208.0.0) and see if they match the prefix address (which is 128.208.128.0). They do not match. Checking the first 18 bits for the Electrical Engineering Dept., we get 128.208.0.0 when ANDing with the subnet mask. This does match the prefix address, so the packet isforwarded ontotheinterfacewhichleads totheElectrical Engineering network. 446 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 The subnet divisions can be changed later if necessary, by updating all subnet masks at routers inside the university. Outside the network, the subnetting is not visible, so allocating a new subnet does not require contacting ICANN or chang- inganyexternal databases. CIDR—Classless InterDomain Routing Even if blocks of IP addresses are allocated so that the addresses are used ef- ficiently, there isstillaproblem thatremains: routingtable explosion. Routers in organizations at the edge of a network, such as a university, need to have an entry for each of their subnets, telling the router which line to use to get to that network. For routes to destinations outside of the organization, they can use the simple default rule of sending the packets on the line toward the ISP that connects the organization to the rest of the Internet. The other destination ad- dresses mustallbeoutthere somewhere. Routers in ISPs and backbones inthe middle of the Internet have no such lux- ury. They must know which way to go to get to every network and no simple de- fault will work. These core routers are said to be in the default-free zone of the Internet. No one really knows how many networks are connected to the Internet any more, but it is a large number, probably at least a million. This can make for a very large table. It may not sound large by computer standards, but realize that routers must perform a lookup inthis table to forward every packet, and routers at large ISPs may forward up to millions of packets per second. Specialized hard- ware and fast memory are needed to process packets at these rates, not a general- purposecomputer', 'In addition, routing algorithms require each router to exchange information aboutthe addresses itcan reachwithotherrouters. Thelarger thetables, themore information needs to be communicated and processed. The processing grows at least linearly with the table size. Greater communication increases the likelihood that some parts willget lost, at least temporarily, possibly leading to routing insta- bilities. The routing table problem could have been solved by going to a deeper hier- archy, like the telephone network. For example, having each IP address contain a country, state/province, city, network, and host field might work. Then, each router would only need to know how to get to each country, the states or pro- vinces initsowncountry,the citiesinits state or province, and the networks inits city. Unfortunately, this solution would require considerably more than 32 bits for IP addresses and would use addresses inefficiently (and Liechtenstein would have asmanybitsinitsaddresses astheUnited States). Fortunately, there is something we can do to reduce routing table sizes. We can apply the same insight as subnetting: routers at different locations can know about a given IP address as belonging to prefixes of different sizes. However, in- stead of splitting an address block into subnets, here we combine multiple small SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 447 prefixes into a single larger prefix. This process is called route aggregation. The resulting larger prefix is sometimes called a supernet, to contrast with subnets as thedivisionofblocksofaddresses. With aggregation, IP addresses are contained inprefixes of varying sizes. The same IP address that one router treats as part of a /22 (a block containing 210 ad- dresses) may be treated by another router as part of a larger /20 (which contains 212 addresses). It is up to each router to have the corresponding prefix infor- mation. This design works with subnetting and is called CIDR (Classless Inter- Domain Routing),which ispronounced‘‘cider,’’asinthedrink. The mostrecent version of it is specified in RFC 4632 (Fuller and Li, 2006). The name highlights the contrast with addresses that encode hierarchy with classes, which we will de- scribe shortly. To make CIDR easier to understand, let us consider an example in which a block of 8192 IP addresses is available starting at 194.24.0.0. Suppose that Cam- bridge University needs 2048 addresses and is assigned the addresses 194.24.0.0 through 194.24.7.255, along with mask 255.255.248.0. This is a /21 prefix. Next, Oxford University asks for 4096addresses. Since a block of 4096 addresses must lie on a 4096-byte boundary, Oxford cannot be given addresses starting at 194.24.8.0. Instead, it gets 194.24.16.0 through 194.24.31.255, along with subnet mask 255.255.240.0. Finally, the University of Edinburgh asks for 1024 ad- dresses and is assigned addresses 194.24.8.0 through 194.24.11.255 and mask 255.255.252.0. These assignments are summarized inFig. 5-50.

All of the routers in the default-free zone are now told about the IP addresses in the three networks', 'Routers close to the universities may need to send on a dif- ferent outgoing line for each of the prefixes, so they need an entry for each of the prefixes intheir routingtables.

AggregationofIPprefixes. the prefixes that the New York router must be told about and the routing table en- tries intheNew Yorkrouter. When aggregation is turned on, it is an automatic process. It depends on which prefixes are located where in the Internet not on the actions of an adminis- trator assigning addresses to networks. Aggregation is heavily used throughout theInternet andcanreduce thesize ofrouter tables toaround200,000prefixes. Asafurther twist, prefixes are allowed tooverlap. Therule isthatpackets are sent in the direction of the most specific route, or the longest matching prefix that has the fewest IP addresses. Longest matching prefix routing provides a use- ful degree of flexibility, as seen in the behavior of the router at New York in Fig.5-52. This router still uses a single aggregate prefix to send traffic for the three universities to London. However, the previously available block of ad- dresses within this prefix has now been allocated to a network in San Francisco. One possibility is for the New York router to keep four prefixes, sending packets for three of them to London and packets for the fourth to San Francisco. Instead, longest matching prefix routing can handle this forwarding with the two prefixes that are shown. One overall prefix is used to direct traffic for the entire block to London. One more specific prefix is also used to direct a portion of the larger prefix to San Francisco. With the longest matching prefix rule, IP addresses with- in the San Francisco network will be sent on the outgoing line to San Francisco, andallotherIPaddresses inthelarger prefixwillbesenttoLondon. Conceptually, CIDR works as follows. When a packet comes in, the routing table isscanned todetermine ifthe destination lies within theprefix. Itispossible that multiple entries with different prefix lengths will match, in which case the entry with the longest prefix is used. Thus, if there is a match for a /20 mask and a/24mask, the/24entry isused tolookupthe outgoing line forthe packet. How- ever, this process would be tedious if the table were really scanned entry byentry.

LongestmatchingprefixroutingattheNewYorkrouter. Instead, complex algorithms have been devised to speed up the address matching process (Ruiz-Sanchez et al., 2001). Commercial routers use custom VLSI chips withthese algorithms embedded inhardware', 'Classful andSpecial Addressing To help you better appreciate why CIDR is so useful, we will briefly relate the design that predated it. Before 1993, IP addresses were divided into the five categories listed in Fig.5-53. This allocation has come to be called classful addressing. 32Bits Rangeofhost Class addresses 1.0.0.0to A 0 Network Host 127.255.255.255 128.0.0.0to B 10 Network Host 191.255.255.255 192.0.0.0to C 110 Network Host 223.255.255.255 224.0.0.0to D 1110 Multicastaddress 239.255.255.255 240.0.0.0to E 1111 Reservedforfutureuse 255.255.255.255 Figure5-53. IPaddressformats. The class A, B, and C formats allow for up to 128 networks with 16 million hosts each, 16,384 networks with up to 65,536 hosts each, and 2 million networks (e.g., LANs) with upto256hostseach (althougha few ofthese are special). Also supported is multicast (the class D format), in which a datagram is directed to multiple hosts. Addresses beginning with 1111 are reserved for use in the future. They would be valuable to use now given the depletion of the IPv4 address space. 450 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Unfortunately, many hosts will not accept these addresses as valid because they have been off-limitsforsolonganditishardtoteacholdhostsnewtricks. This is a hierarchical design, but unlike CIDR the sizes of the address blocks are fixed. Over 2 billion addresses exist, but organizing the address space by classes wastes millions of them. In particular, the real villain is the class B net- work. For most organizations, a class A network, with 16 million addresses, is too big, and a class C network, with 256 addresses is too small. A class B net- work, with 65,536, is just right. In Internet folklore, this situation is known as the threebears problem [asinGoldilocks andtheThree Bears (Southey, 1848)]. In reality, though, a class B address is far too large for most organizations. Studies have shownthatmorethanhalfofallclass Bnetworks have fewer than50 hosts. A class C network would have done the job, but no doubt every organiza- tion that asked for a class B address thought that one day it would outgrow the 8- bit host field. In retrospect, it might have been better to have had class C net- works use 10 bits instead of 8 for the host number, allowing 1022 hosts per net- work. Had this been the case, most organizations would probably have settled for a class C network, and there would have been half a million of them (versus only 16,384class Bnetworks). It is hard to fault the Internet’s designers for not having provided more (and smaller) class B addresses. At the time the decision was made to create the three classes, the Internet was a research network connectingthe major research univer- sities in the U.S. (plus a very small number of companies and military sites doing networking research). No one then perceived the Internet becoming a mass- market communication system rivaling the telephonenetwork. Atthe time, some- one no doubt said: ‘‘The U.S. has about 2000 colleges and universities. Even if all of them connect to the Internet and many universities in other countries join, too, we are never going to hit 16,000, since there are not that many universities in the whole world', 'Furthermore, having the host number be an integral number of bytes speeds up packet processing’’ (which was then done entirely in software). Perhaps some day people will lookback and fault the folkswhodesigned the tele- phone number scheme and say: ‘‘What idiots. Why didn’t they include the planet number inthephonenumber?’’Butatthetime, itdidnotseem necessary. To handle these problems, subnets were introduced to flexibly assign blocks of addresses within an organization. Later, CIDR was added to reduce the size of the global routing table. Today, the bits that indicate whether an IP address be- longs to class A, B, or C network are no longer used, though references to these classes intheliteratureare stillcommon. Tosee howdroppingtheclasses made forwarding more complicated, consider how simple it was in the old classful system. When a packet arrived at a router, a copy of the IP address was shifted right 28 bits to yield a 4-bit class number. A 16-way branch then sorted packets into A, B, C (and D and E) classes, with eight of the cases for class A, four of the cases for class B, and two of the cases for class C. The code for each class then masked off the 8-, 16-, or 24-bit network SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 451 number and right aligned it in a 32-bit word. The network number was then looked up in the A, B, or C table, usually by indexing for A and B networks and hashing for C networks. Once the entry was found, the outgoing line could be looked up and the packet forwarded. This is much simpler than the longest matching prefix operation, which can nolonger use a simple table lookupbecause anIPaddress mayhave anylengthprefix. Class D addresses continue to be used in the Internet for multicast. Actually, it might be more accurate to say that they are starting to be used for multicast, since Internet multicasthasnotbeen widely deployed inthepast. There are alsoseveral other addresses thathave special meanings, as shown in Fig.5-54. The IP address 0.0.0.0, the lowest address, is used by hosts when they are being booted. It means ‘‘this network’’ or ‘‘this host.’’ IP addresses with 0 as the network numberrefer tothecurrent network. These addresses allow machines to refer to their own network without knowing its number (but they have to know the network mask toknowhowmany 0stoinclude). The address consisting ofall 1s, or 255.255.255.255—the highest address—is used to mean all hosts on the in- dicated network. It allows broadcasting on the local network, typically a LAN. The addresses with aproper network number and all 1sinthe hostfield allow ma- chines to send broadcast packets to distant LANs anywhere in the Internet. How- ever, many network administrators disable this feature as it is mostly a security hazard. Finally, all addresses of the form 127.xx.yy.zz are reserved for loopback testing. Packets sent to that address are not put out onto the wire; they are proc- essed locally and treated as incoming packets. This allows packets to be sent to thehostwithoutthesender knowingitsnumber, whichisusefulfortesting', '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Thishost 0 0 ... 0 0 Host Ahostonthisnetwork Broadcastonthe 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 localnetwork Broadcastona Network 1111 ... 1111 distantnetwork 127 (Anything) Loopback Figure5-54. SpecialIPaddresses. NAT—Network Address Translation IP addresses are scarce. An ISP might have a /16 address, giving it 65,534 usable hostnumbers. Ifithasmore customers thanthat, ithasaproblem. 452 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 This scarcity has led to techniques to use IP addresses sparingly. One ap- proach is to dynamically assign an IP address to a computer when it is on and using the network, and to take the IP address back when the host becomes inac- tive. The IP address can then be assigned to another computer that becomes ac- tive. Inthisway, asingle /16address canhandle upto65,534active users. This strategy works well in some cases, for example, for dialup networking and mobile and other computers that may be temporarily absent or powered off. However, it does not work very well for business customers. Many PCs in busi- nesses are expected to be on continuously. Some are employee machines, backed up at night, and some are servers that may have to serve a remote request at a moment’s notice. These businesses have an access line that always provides con- nectivity totherestoftheInternet. Increasingly, this situation also applies to home users subscribing to ADSL or Internet over cable, since there is no connection charge (just a monthly flat rate charge). Many of these users have two or more computers at home, often one for each family member, and they all want to be online all the time. The solution is to connect all the computers into a home network via a LAN and put a (wireless) router onit. The router then connectstothe ISP. From the ISP’s pointofview, the family is now the same as a small business with a handful of computers. Wel- come toJones, Inc. With the techniques we have seen sofar, eachcomputer must have its own IP address all day long. For an ISP with many thousands of custom- ers, particularly business customers and families that are just like small busi- nesses, thedemand forIPaddresses canquicklyexceedthe blockthatisavailable. The problem of running out of IP addresses is not a theoretical one that might occur at some point in the distant future. It is happening right here and right now. The long-term solution is for the whole Internet to migrate to IPv6, which has 128-bit addresses. This transition is slowly occurring, but it will be years before the process is complete. To get by in the meantime, a quick fix was needed. The quick fix that is widely used today came in the form of NAT (Network Address Translation), which is described in RFC 3022 and which we will summarize below. Foradditionalinformation, see Dutcher (2001)', 'The basic idea behind NAT is for the ISP to assign each home or business a single IP address (or at most, a small number of them) for Internet traffic. Within the customer network, every computer gets a unique IP address, which is used for routing intramural traffic. However, just before a packet exits the customer net- work and goes to the ISP, an address translation from the unique internal IP ad- dress to the shared public IP address takes place. This translation makes use of three ranges of IP addresses that have been declared as private. Networks may use them internally as they wish. The onlyrule isthat nopackets containing these addresses mayappear ontheInternet itself. Thethree reserved ranges are: 10.0.0.0 –10.255.255.255/8 (16,777,216hosts) 172.16.0.0 –172.31.255.255/12 (1,048,576hosts) 192.168.0.0 –192.168.255.255/16 (65,536hosts) SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 453 The first range provides for 16,777,216 addresses (except for all 0s and all 1s, as usual)andistheusualchoice, even ifthenetwork isnotlarge. The operation of NAT is shown in Fig. 5-55. Within the customer premises, every machine hasauniqueaddress oftheform10.x.y.z. However, before apack- etleaves thecustomer premises, itpasses throughaNAT boxthat convertsthe in- ternal IP source address, 10.0.0.1 in the figure, to the customer’s true IP address, 198.60.42.12 in this example. The NAT box is often combined in a single device with a firewall, which provides security by carefully controlling what goes into the customer network and what comes out of it. We will study firewalls in Chap. 8. Itisalsopossible tointegrate theNATboxintoarouter orADSL modem.

PlacementandoperationofaNATbox. So far, we have glossed over one tinybutcrucial detail: when the reply comes back (e.g., from a Web server), it is naturally addressed to 198.60.42.12, so how does the NAT boxknowwhich internal address toreplace it with? Herein lies the problem withNAT. Ifthere were aspare field intheIPheader, thatfield couldbe used to keep track of who the real sender was, but only 1 bit is still unused. In principle, a new option could be created tohold the true source address, but doing sowouldrequire changing theIPcode onallthemachines ontheentire Internet to handle thenewoption. Thisisnotapromisingalternative foraquickfix. What actually happens is as follows. The NAT designers observed that most IP packets carry either TCP or UDP payloads. When we study TCP and UDP in Chap. 6,wewillsee thatbothofthese have headers containing asource portanda destination port. Below we willjust discuss TCP ports, butexactly the same story holds for UDP ports. The ports are 16-bit integers that indicate where the TCP connection begins and ends. These ports provide the field needed to make NAT work. When a process wants to establish a TCP connection with a remote process, it attaches itself to an unused TCP port on its own machine. This is called the source port and tells the TCP code where to send incoming packets belonging to this connection. The process also supplies a destination port to tell who to give 454 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 the packets to on the remote side. Ports 0–1023 are reserved for well-known ser- vices', 'For example, port80isthe portused byWeb servers, soremote clients can locate them. Each outgoing TCP message contains botha source port and a desti- nation port. Together, these ports serve to identify the processes using the con- nection onbothends. An analogy may make the use of ports clearer. Imagine a company with a single main telephone number. When people call the main number, they reach an operator who asks which extension they want and then puts them through to that extension. The main number is analogous to the customer’s IP address and the extensions on both ends are analogous to the ports. Ports are effectively an extra 16bitsofaddressing thatidentify whichprocess getswhichincoming packet. Using the Source port field, we can solve our mapping problem. Whenever an outgoing packet enters the NAT box, the 10.x.y.z source address is replaced by the customer’s true IP address. In addition, the TCP Source port field is replaced by an index into the NAT box’s 65,536-entry translation table. This table entry contains the original IP address and the original source port. Finally, both the IP and TCP header checksums are recomputed and inserted into the packet. It is necessary to replace the Source port because connections from machines 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 may both happen to use port 5000, for example, so the Source port alone isnotenoughtoidentify thesending process. When a packet arrives at the NAT box from the ISP, the Source port in the TCP header is extracted and used as an index into the NAT box’s mapping table. From the entry located, the internal IP address and original TCP Source port are extracted and inserted into the packet. Then, both the IP and TCP checksums are recomputed and inserted into the packet. The packet is then passed to the custo- mer routerfornormal delivery usingthe10.x.y.z address. Although this scheme sort of solves the problem, networking purists in the IP community have a tendency to regard it as an abomination-on-the-face-of-the- earth. Briefly summarized, here are some of the objections. First, NAT violates the architectural model of IP, which states that every IP address uniquely identi- fies a single machine worldwide. The whole software structure of the Internet is built on this fact. With NAT, thousands of machines may (and do) use address 10.0.0.1. Second, NAT breaks the end-to-end connectivity model of the Internet, which says that any host can send a packet toany other host at anytime. Since the map- ping in the NAT box is set up by outgoing packets, incoming packets cannot be accepted until after outgoing ones. In practice, this means that a home user with NAT can make TCP/IP connections to a remote Web server, but a remote user cannotmake connectionstoa game server onthehomenetwork. Special configu- ration orNATtraversal techniques are needed tosupportthiskindofsituation. Third, NAT changes the Internet from a connectionless network to a peculiar kind of connection-oriented network. The problem is that the NAT box must maintain information (i.e., the mapping) for each connection passing through it. SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 455 Having the network maintain connectionstate isapropertyofconnection-oriented networks, not connectionless ones', 'If the NAT box crashes and its mapping table is lost, all its TCP connectionsare destroyed. Inthe absence ofNAT, a router can crash and restart withnolong-termeffect onTCP connections. The sending proc- ess just times out within a few seconds and retransmits all unacknowledged pack- ets. WithNAT, theInternet becomes asvulnerable asacircuit-switched network. Fourth, NAT violates the most fundamental rule of protocol layering: layer k may not make any assumptions about what layer k +1 has put into the payload field. This basic principle is there to keep the layers independent. If TCP is later upgraded to TCP-2, with a different header layout (e.g., 32-bit ports), NAT will fail. The whole idea of layered protocols is toensure that changes in one layer do notrequire changes inother layers. NATdestroys thisindependence. Fifth, processes on the Internet are not required to use TCP or UDP. If a user on machine A decides to use some new transport protocol to talk to a user on ma- chine B (for example, for a multimedia application), introduction of a NAT box will cause the application to fail because the NAT box will not be able to locate theTCP Sourceportcorrectly. A sixth and related problem is that some applications use multiple TCP/IP connections or UDP ports in prescribed ways. For example, FTP, the standard File Transfer Protocol,inserts IPaddresses inthe bodyofpacket forthe receiver to extract and use. Since NAT knows nothing about these arrangements, it cannot rewrite the IP addresses or otherwise account for them. This lack of under- standing means that FTP and other applications such as the H.323 Internet tele- phony protocol (which we will study in Chap. 7) will fail in the presence of NAT unless special precautions are taken. It is often possible to patch NAT for these cases, but having to patch the code in the NAT box every time a new application comes alongisnotagoodidea. Finally, since the TCP Source port field is 16 bits, at most 65,536 machines can be mapped onto an IP address. Actually, the number is slightly less because the first 4096 ports are reserved for special uses. However, if multiple IP ad- dresses are available, eachonecan handle upto61,440machines. Aview of these and other problems with NAT is given in RFC 2993. Despite the issues, NAT iswidely used inpractice, especially forhomeandsmall business networks, as the only expedient technique to deal with the IP address shortage. It has become wrapped up with firewalls and privacy because it blocks unsolicited incoming packets by default. For this reason, it is unlikely to go away even when IPv6iswidely deployed. 5.6.3 IP Version 6 IP has been in heavy use for decades. It has worked extremely well, as demonstrated bythe exponential growth of the Internet. Unfortunately, IP has be- come a victim of its own popularity: it is close to running out of addresses. Even 456 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 with CIDR and NAT using addresses more sparingly, the last IPv4 addresses are expected to be assigned byICANN before the end of 2012', 'This looming disaster was recognized almost two decades ago, and it sparked a great deal of discussion andcontroversy within theInternet community aboutwhat todoaboutit. In this section, we will describe both the problem and several proposed solu- tions. The only long-term solution is to move to larger addresses. IPv6 (IP ver- sion 6) is a replacement design that does just that. It uses 128-bit addresses; a shortage of these addresses is not likely any time in the foreseeable future. How- ever, IPv6 has proved very difficult to deploy. It is a different network layer pro- tocol that does not really interwork with IPv4, despite many similarities. Also, companies and users are not really sure why they should want IPv6 in any case. The result is that IPv6 is deployed and used on only a tiny fraction of the Internet (estimates are 1%) despite having been an Internet Standard since 1998. The next several years will be an interesting time, as the few remaining IPv4 addresses are allocated. Will people start to auction off their IPv4 addresses on eBay? Will a black market inthemspringup?Whoknows. In addition to the address problems, other issues loom in the background. In its early years, the Internet was largely used by universities, high-tech industries, and the U.S. Government (especially the Dept. of Defense). With the explosion of interest in the Internet starting in the mid-1990s, it began to be used by a dif- ferent group of people, often with different requirements. For one thing, numer- ous people with smart phones use it to keep incontact with their home bases. For another, with the impending convergence of the computer, communication, and entertainment industries, it may not be that long before every telephone and tele- vision set in the world is an Internet node, resulting in a billion machines being used for audio and video on demand. Under these circumstances, it became apparent thatIPhadtoevolve andbecome moreflexible. Seeing these problems on the horizon, in 1990 IETF started work on a new version of IP, one that would never run out of addresses, would solve a variety of other problems, andbemore flexible andefficient aswell. Itsmajor goalswere: 1. Supportbillionsofhosts,evenwithinefficient address allocation. 2. Reduce thesize oftheroutingtables. 3. Simplify theprotocol, toallow routers toprocess packets faster. 4. Provide better security (authentication andprivacy). 5. Paymore attention tothetypeofservice, particularly forreal-time data. 6. Aidmulticastingbyallowing scopes tobespecified. 7. Make itpossibleforahosttoroamwithoutchanging itsaddress. 8. Allowtheprotocol toevolve inthefuture. 9. Permit theoldandnewprotocols tocoexist foryears. SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 457 The design of IPv6 presented a major opportunity to improve all of the fea- turesinIPv4thatfall shortofwhatisnowwanted. Todevelop aprotocol thatmet all these requirements, IETF issued a call for proposals and discussion in RFC 1550. Twenty-one responses were initially received. By December 1992, seven serious proposals were on the table. They ranged from making minor patches to IP, to throwing it out altogether and replacing itwith acompletely different proto- col. One proposal was to run TCP over CLNP, the network layer protocol de- signed for OSI', 'With its 160-bit addresses, CLNP would have provided enough address space forever as it could give every molecule of water in the oceans enough addresses (roughly 25) to set up a small network. This choice would also have unified two major network layer protocols. However, many people felt that this would have been an admission that something in the OSI world was actually done right, a statement considered Politically Incorrect in Internet circles. CLNP was patterned closely on IP, so the two are not really that different. In fact, the protocol ultimately chosen differs from IP far more than CLNP does. Another strike against CLNP was its poor support for service types, something required to transmit multimediaefficiently. Three of the better proposals were published in IEEE Network (Deering, 1993; Francis, 1993; and Katz and Ford, 1993). After much discussion, revision, and jockeying for position, a modified combined version of the Deering and Francis proposals, by now called SIPP (Simple Internet Protocol Plus) was se- lected andgiventhedesignation IPv6. IPv6 meets IETF’s goals fairly well. It maintains the goodfeatures of IP, dis- cards or deemphasizes the bad ones, and adds new ones where needed. In gener- al, IPv6 is not compatible with IPv4, but it is compatible with the other auxiliary Internet protocols, including TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF, BGP, and DNS, with small modifications being required to deal with longer addresses. The main features of IPv6 are discussed below. More information about it can be found in RFCs 2460through2466. First and foremost, IPv6 has longer addresses than IPv4. They are 128 bits long, which solves the problem that IPv6 set out to solve: providing an effectively unlimited supplyof Internet addresses. We will have more to say about addresses shortly. The second major improvement of IPv6 is the simplification of the header. It contains only seven fields (versus 13 in IPv4). This change allows routers to process packets faster and thus improves throughput and delay. We will discuss theheader shortly,too. The third major improvement is better support for options. This change was essential with the new header because fields that previously were required are now optional (because they are not used so often). In addition, the way options are represented is different, making it simple for routers to skip over options not intended forthem. Thisfeature speeds uppacket processing time. 458 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Afourth area inwhich IPv6 represents a bigadvance is insecurity. IETF had its fill of newspaper stories about precocious 12-year-olds using their personal computers to break into banks and military bases all over the Internet. There was a strong feeling that something had to be done to improve security. Authentica- tion and privacy are key features of the new IP. These were later retrofitted to IPv4,however, sointhearea ofsecurity thedifferences are notsogreat anymore. Finally, more attention has been paid to quality of service. Various half- hearted efforts to improve QoS have been made in the past, but now, with the growthofmultimediaontheInternet, thesense ofurgency isgreater. The Main IPv6Header The IPv6header isshowninFig.5-56. The Version field isalways 6forIPv6 (and 4 for IPv4)', 'During the transition period from IPv4, which has already taken more than a decade, routers will be able to examine this field to tell what kind of packet they have. As an aside, making this test wastes a few instructions in the criticalpath, given that the data link header usually indicates the network protocol for demultiplexing, so some routers may skip the check. For example, the Ether- net Type field has different values to indicate an IPv4 or an IPv6 payload. The discussions between the ‘‘Do it right’’ and ‘‘Make it fast’’ camps will no doubt be lengthyandvigorous. 32Bits Version Diff.services Flowlabel Payloadlength Nextheader Hoplimit Sourceaddress (16bytes) Destinationaddress (16bytes) Figure5-56. TheIPv6fixedheader(required). The Differentiated services field (originally called Traffic class) is used to distinguish the class of service for packets with different real-time delivery SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 459 requirements. It is used with the differentiated service architecture for quality of service inthe same manner as thefield ofthesame name intheIPv4packet. Also, the low-order 2 bits are used to signal explicit congestion indications, again in the same wayaswithIPv4. The Flow label field provides a way for a source and destination to mark groups of packets that have the same requirements and should be treated in the same way bythe network, forming a pseudoconnection. For example, a stream of packets from one process on a certain source host to a process on a specific desti- nation host might have stringent delay requirements and thus need reserved band- width. The flow can be set up in advance and given an identifier. When a packet with a nonzero Flow label shows up, all the routers can look it up in internal tables to see what kind of special treatment it requires. In effect, flows are an at- tempt to have it both ways: the flexibility of a datagram network and the guaran- tees ofavirtual-circuit network. Each flow for quality of service purposes is designated by the source address, destination address, and flow number. This design means that up to 220 flows may be active at the same time between a given pair of IP addresses. It also means that even if two flows coming from different hosts but with the same flow label pass through the same router, the router will be able to tell them apart using the source and destination addresses. It is expected that flow labels will be cho- sen randomly, rather than assigned sequentially starting at 1, so routers are ex- pected tohashthem. The Payload length field tells how many bytes follow the 40-byte header of Fig.5-56. The name was changed from the IPv4 Total length field because the meaning was changed slightly: the 40 header bytes are no longer counted as part of the length (as they used to be). This change means the payload can now be 65,535bytesinstead ofamere 65,515bytes. The Next header field lets the cat out of the bag. The reason the header could be simplified is that there can be additional (optional) extension headers', 'This field tells which of the (currently) six extension headers, if any, follow this one. If this header is the last IP header, the Next header field tells which transport pro- tocolhandler (e.g., TCP, UDP) topassthepacket to. The Hop limit field is used to keep packets from living forever. It is, in prac- tice, the same as the Time to live field inIPv4, namely, a field that isdecremented oneach hop. In theory, in IPv4 it was a time in seconds, but norouter used it that way, sothename was changed toreflect thewayitisactually used. Next come the Source address and Destination address fields. Deering’s original proposal, SIP, used 8-byte addresses, but during the review process many people felt that with 8-byte addresses IPv6 would run out of addresses within a few decades, whereas with 16-byte addresses it would never run out. Other peo- ple argued that 16 bytes was overkill, whereas still others favored using 20-byte addresses to be compatible with the OSI datagram protocol. Still another faction wanted variable-sized addresses. After much debate and more than a few words 460 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 unprintable in an academic textbook, it was decided that fixed-length 16-byte ad- dresses were thebestcompromise. A new notation has been devised for writing 16-byte addresses. They are writtenaseightgroupsoffourhexadecimal digitswithcolons between thegroups, likethis: 8000:0000:0000:0000:0123:4567:89AB:CDEF Since many addresses will have many zeros inside them, three optimizations have been authorized. First, leading zeros within a group can be omitted, so 0123 can be written as 123. Second, one or more groups of 16 zero bits can be replaced by apairofcolons. Thus,theaboveaddress nowbecomes 8000::123:4567:89AB:CDEF Finally, IPv4 addresses can be written as a pair of colons and an old dotted decimal number, forexample: ::192.31.20.46 Perhaps it is unnecessary to be so explicit about it, but there are a lot of 16- byte addresses. Specifically, there are 2128 of them, which is approximately 3×1038. If the entire earth, land and water, were covered with computers, IPv6 would allow 7×1023 IP addresses per square meter. Students of chemistry will notice that this number is larger than Avogadro’s number. While it was not the intention to give every molecule onthe surfaceofthe earth itsownIP address, we are notthatfar off. Inpractice, theaddress spacewillnotbeused efficiently, just as the telephone number address space is not (the area code for Manhattan, 212, is nearly full, but that for Wyoming, 307,is nearly empty). In RFC 3194, Durand and Huitema cal- culated that, using the allocation of telephone numbers as a guide, even in the most pessimistic scenario there will still be well over 1000 IP addresses per square meter of the entire earth’s surface (land and water). In any likely scenario, there willbe trillionsofthem per square meter. Inshort, it seems unlikely that we willrunoutintheforeseeablefuture. It is instructive to compare the IPv4 header (Fig.5-46) with the IPv6 header (Fig. 5-56) to see what has been left out in IPv6. The IHL field is gone because the IPv6 header has a fixed length', 'The Protocol field was taken out because the Next header field tells what follows the last IP header (e.g., a UDP or TCP seg- ment). All the fields relating to fragmentation were removed because IPv6 takes a different approach to fragmentation. To start with, all IPv6-conformant hosts are expected to dynamically determine the packet size to use. They do this using the path MTU discovery procedure we described in Sec. 5.5.5. In brief, when a host sends an IPv6 packet that is too large, instead of fragmenting it, the router that is unable to forward it drops the packet and sends an error message back to the SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 461 sending host. This message tells the host to break up all future packets to that destination. Having the host send packets that are the right size in the first place is ultimately much more efficient than having the routers fragment them on the fly. Also, the minimum-size packet that routers must be able to forward has been raised from576to1280bytestoallow 1024bytesofdata andmanyheaders. Finally, the Checksum field is gone because calculating it greatly reduces per- formance. With the reliable networks now used, combined with the fact that the data link layer and transport layers normally have their own checksums, the value of yet another checksum was deemed not worth the performance price it extracted. Removing all these features has resulted in a lean and mean network layer protocol. Thus, the goal of IPv6—a fast, yet flexible, protocol with plenty ofaddress space—ismetbythisdesign. Extension Headers Some of the missing IPv4 fields are occasionally still needed, so IPv6 intro- duces the concept of (optional) extension headers. These headers can be sup- plied to provide extra information, but encoded in an efficient way. Six kinds of extension headers are defined at present, as listed in Fig.5-57. Each one is op- tional, but if more than one is present they must appear directly after the fixed header, andpreferably intheorder listed. Extensionheader Description Hop-by-hopoptions Miscellaneousinformationforrouters Destinationoptions Additionalinformationforthedestination Routing Looselistofrouterstovisit Fragmentation Managementofdatagramfragments Authentication Verificationofthesender’sidentity Encryptedsecuritypayload Informationabouttheencryptedcontents Figure5-57. IPv6extensionheaders. Some of the headers have a fixed format; others contain a variable number of variable-length options. For these, each item is encoded as a (Type, Length, Value) tuple. The Type is a 1-byte field telling which option this is. The Type values have been chosen so that the first 2 bits tell routers that do not know how to process the option what to do. The choices are: skip the option; discard the packet; discard the packet and send back an ICMP packet; and discard the packet but do not send ICMP packets for multicast addresses (to prevent one bad multi- cast packet fromgenerating millionsofICMP reports). The Length is also a 1-byte field. It tells how long the value is (0 to 255 bytes). The Value isanyinformation required, upto255bytes. 462 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 The hop-by-hop header is used for information that all routers along the path must examine. So far, one option has been defined: support of datagrams exceed- ing 64 KB', 'The format of this header is shown in Fig. 5-58. When it is used, the Payloadlengthfield inthefixed header issetto0. Nextheader 0 194 4 Jumbopayloadlength Figure5-58. Thehop-by-hopextensionheaderforlargedatagrams(jumbograms). As with all extension headers, this one starts with a byte telling what kind of header comes next. This byte is followed by one telling how longthe hop-by-hop header is in bytes, excluding the first 8 bytes, which are mandatory. All exten- sionsbeginthisway. The next 2bytes indicate that this option defines the datagram size (code 194) and that the size is a 4-byte number. The last 4 bytes give the size of the data- gram. Sizes less than 65,536 bytes are not permitted and will result in the first router discarding the packet and sending back an ICMP error message. Data- grams using this header extension are called jumbograms. The use of jumbo- grams is important for supercomputer applications that must transfer gigabytes of data efficiently across theInternet. The destination options header is intended for fields that need only be inter- preted at the destination host. In the initial version of IPv6, the only options de- fined are null options for padding this header out to a multiple of 8 bytes, so ini- tially it will not be used. It was included to make sure that new routing and host software canhandle it,incase someone thinksofadestination optionsome day. The routing header lists one ormore routers that must bevisited onthe way to the destination. It is very similar to the IPv4 loose source routing in that all ad- dresses listed must be visited in order, but other routers not listed may be visited inbetween. The format oftheroutingheader isshowninFig. 5-59. Headerextension Nextheader Routingtype Segmentsleft length Type-specificdata Figure5-59. Theextensionheaderforrouting. SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 463 The first 4 bytes of the routing extension header contain four 1-byte integers. The Next header and Header extension length fields were described above. The Routingtype field gives theformat oftherestoftheheader. Type 0says that a re- served 32-bit word follows the first word, followed by some number of IPv6 ad- dresses. Other types may be invented in the future, as needed. Finally, the Seg- ments left field keeps track of how many of the addresses in the list have not yet been visited. It is decremented every time one is visited. When it hits 0, the packet is on its own with no more guidance about what route to follow. Usually, atthispointitissoclose tothedestination thatthebest routeisobvious. The fragment header deals with fragmentation similarly to the way IPv4 does. The header holds the datagram identifier, fragment number, and a bit telling whether more fragments will follow. In IPv6, unlike inIPv4, onlythe source host can fragment a packet. Routers along the way may not do this. This change is a major philosophical break with the original IP, but in keeping with current prac- tice for IPv4. Plus, it simplifies the routers’ work and makes routing gofaster. As mentioned above, if a router is confronted with a packet that is too big, it discards the packet and sends an ICMP error packet back to the source', 'This information allows the source hosttofragment the packet into smaller pieces using this header andtryagain. The authentication header provides a mechanism by which the receiver of a packet can be sure of who sent it. The encrypted security payload makes it pos- sible to encrypt the contents of a packet so that only the intended recipient can read it. These headers use the cryptographic techniques that we will describe in Chap. 8toaccomplishtheir missions. Controversies Given the open design process and the strongly held opinions of many of the people involved, it should come as no surprise that many choices made for IPv6 were highly controversial, to say the least. We will summarize a few of these briefly below. Forallthegorydetails, see theRFCs. We have already mentioned theargument abouttheaddress length. The result was acompromise: 16-bytefixed-length addresses. Another fight developed over the length of the Hop limit field. One camp felt strongly that limiting the maximum number of hops to 255 (implicit in using an 8-bit field) was agross mistake. After all, paths of 32hops are common now, and 10years from now much longerpaths may be common. These people argued that using a huge address size was farsighted but using a tiny hop count was short- sighted. In their view, the greatest sin a computer scientist can commit is to pro- videtoofew bitssomewhere. The response was that arguments could be made to increase every field, lead- ing to a bloated header. Also, the function of the Hop limit field is to keep pack- etsfromwandering aroundfortoolonga time and65,535hopsisfar, far toolong. 464 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Finally, as the Internet grows, more and more long-distance links will be built, making it possible to get from any country to any other country in half a dozen hops at most. If it takes more than 125 hops to get from the source and the desti- nation to their respective international gateways, something is wrong with the na- tional backbones. The8-bitterswonthisone. Another hot potato was the maximum packet size. The supercomputer com- munity wanted packets in excess of 64 KB. When a supercomputer gets started transferring, it really means business and does not want to be interrupted every 64 KB. The argument against large packets is that if a 1-MB packet hits a 1.5-Mbps T1 line, that packet will tie the line up for over 5 seconds, producing a very noticeabledelay forinteractive users sharingtheline. Acompromise was reached here: normal packets are limited to 64 KB, but the hop-by-hop extension header can beusedtopermit jumbograms. A third hot topic was removing the IPv4 checksum. Some people likened this move to removing the brakes from a car. Doing so makes the car lighter so it can gofaster, butifanunexpected event happens, youhave aproblem. The argument against checksums was that any application that really cares about data integrity has to have a transport layer checksum anyway, sohaving an- other one in IP (in addition to the data link layer checksum) is overkill. Fur- thermore, experience showed that computing the IP checksum was a major expense inIPv4', 'The antichecksum camp won this one, and IPv6 does not have a checksum. Mobile hosts were also a point of contention. If a portable computer flies halfway around the world, can it continue operating there with the same IPv6 ad- dress, or does it have to use a scheme with home agents? Some people wanted to build explicit support for mobile hosts into IPv6. That effort failed when no con- sensuscouldbefoundforanyspecific proposal. Probably the biggest battlewas aboutsecurity. Everyone agreed it was essen- tial. The war was about where to put it and how. First where. The argument for putting it in the network layer is that it then becomes a standard service that all applications can use without any advance planning. The argument against it is that really secure applications generally want nothing less than end-to-end en- cryption, where the source application does the encryption and the destination ap- plication undoes it. With anything less, the user is at the mercy of potentially buggynetwork layer implementations overwhich hehasnocontrol. Theresponse tothisargument isthatthese applications can justrefrain from usingthe IPsecuri- ty features and dothe job themselves. The rejoinder to that isthat the people who do not trust the network to do it right do not want to pay the price of slow, bulky IPimplementations thathave thiscapability,evenifitisdisabled. Another aspect of where to put security relates to the fact that many (but not all) countries have very stringent export laws concerning cryptography. Some, notably France and Iraq, also restrict its use domestically, so that people cannot have secrets from the government. As a result, any IP implementation that used a SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 465 cryptographic system strong enough to be of much value could not be exported from the United States (and many other countries) to customers worldwide. Hav- ing to maintain two sets of software, one for domestic use and one for export, is something mostcomputer vendorsvigorouslyoppose. One point on which there was no controversy is that no one expects the IPv4 Internet to be turned off on a Sunday evening and come back up as an IPv6 Inter- net Monday morning. Instead, isolated ‘‘islands’’ of IPv6 will be converted, ini- tially communicating via tunnels,as we showed inSec. 5.5.3. As the IPv6islands grow, they will merge into bigger islands. Eventually, all the islands will merge, andtheInternet willbefullyconverted. At least, that was the plan. Deployment has proved the Achilles heel of IPv6. It remains little used, even though all major operating systems fully support it. Most deployments are new situations in which a network operator—for example, amobile phoneoperator— needs alarge number ofIP addresses. Many strategies have been defined to help ease the transition. Among them are ways to automat- ically configure the tunnels that carry IPv6 over the IPv4 Internet, and ways for hosts to automatically find the tunnel endpoints. Dual-stack hosts have an IPv4 and an IPv6 implementation so that they can select which protocol to use depend- ing on the destination of the packet. These strategies will streamline the substan- tial deployment that seems inevitable when IPv4 addresses are exhausted', 'For more information aboutIPv6,see Davies (2008). 5.6.4 Internet Control Protocols Inadditionto IP, which is used for data transfer, the Internet has several com- panion control protocols that are used in the network layer. They include ICMP, ARP, and DHCP. In this section, we will look at each of these in turn, describing the versions that correspond to IPv4 because they are the protocols that are in common use. ICMP and DHCP have similar versions for IPv6; the equivalent of ARPiscalled NDP(NeighborDiscovery Protocol) forIPv6. IMCP—The Internet Control Message Protocol The operation oftheInternet ismonitored closely bytherouters. When some- thing unexpected occurs duringpacket processing at arouter, the event isreported to the sender by the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). ICMP is also used to test the Internet. About a dozen types of ICMP messages are defined. Each ICMP message type is carried encapsulated in an IP packet. The most im- portant onesare listed inFig.5-60. The DESTINATION UNREACHABLE message is used when the router cannot locate the destination or when a packet with the DF bit cannot be delivered be- cause a‘‘small-packet’’network standsintheway. 466 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 Messagetype Description Destinationunreachable Packetcouldnotbedelivered Timeexceeded Timetolivefieldhit0 Parameterproblem Invalidheaderfield Sourcequench Chokepacket Redirect Teacharouteraboutgeography Echoandechoreply Checkifamachineisalive Timestamprequest/reply SameasEcho,butwithtimestamp Routeradvertisement/solicitation Findanearbyrouter Figure5-60. TheprincipalICMPmessagetypes. The TIME EXCEEDED message is sent when a packet is dropped because its TtL (Time to live) counter has reached zero. This event is a symptom that packets are looping,orthatthecountervalues are beingset toolow. One clever use of this error message is the traceroute utility that was devel- oped by Van Jacobson in 1987. Traceroute finds the routers along the path from the host to a destination IP address. It finds this information without any kind of privileged network support. The method is simply to send a sequence of packets tothe destination, first with aTtL of1,then aTtL of2,3, and so on. The counters on these packets will reach zero at successive routers along the path. These rout- ers will each obediently send aTIME EXCEEDED message back to the host. From those messages, the host can determine the IP addresses of the routers along the path, as well as keep statistics and timings on parts of the path. It is not what the TIMEEXCEEDED message was intended for, but it is perhaps the mostuseful net- workdebuggingtoolofalltime. The PARAMETERPROBLEM message indicates that an illegal value has been detected in a header field. This problem indicates a bug in the sending host’s IP software orpossiblyinthesoftware ofarouter transited. The SOURCE QUENCH message was long ago used to throttle hosts that were sending too many packets. When a host received this message, it was expected to slow down. It is rarely used anymore because when congestion occurs, these packets tend to add more fuel to the fire and it is unclear how to respond to them. Congestioncontrol inthe Internet isnowdonelargely bytaking action inthe tran- sport layer, using packet losses as a congestion signal; we will study it in detail in Chap. 6. The REDIRECT message is used when a router notices that a packet seems to berouted incorrectly.

The online list is nowkeptatwww.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters. ARP—The Address Resolution Protocol Although every machine on the Internet has one or more IP addresses, these addresses are not sufficient for sending packets. Data link layer NICs (Network Interface Cards) such as Ethernet cards do not understand Internet addresses. In the case of Ethernet, every NIC ever manufactured comes equipped with a unique 48-bit Ethernet address. Manufacturers of Ethernet NICs request a block of Ethernet addresses from IEEE to ensure that no two NICs have the same address (toavoidconflicts shouldthetwoNICsever appear onthe same LAN). The NICs send and receive frames based on 48-bit Ethernet addresses. They know nothing atallabout32-bitIPaddresses. The question nowarises, howdoIP addresses get mapped onto data link layer addresses, such as Ethernet? Toexplain howthisworks, let ususe the example of Fig.5-61, in which a small university with two /24 networks is illustrated. One network (CS) is a switched Ethernet in the Computer Science Dept. It has the prefix 192.32.65.0/24. The other LAN (EE), also switched Ethernet, is in Electri- cal Engineering and has the prefix 192.32.63.0/24. The two LANs are connected byanIProuter. Each machine onanEthernet andeach interfaceonthe router has a unique Ethernet address, labeled E1 through E6, and a unique IP address on the CSorEEnetwork. Let usstart outbyseeing howauseronhost1sends a packet toauser onhost 2 on the CS network. Let us assume the sender knows the name of the intended receiver, possibly something like eagle.cs.uni.edu. The first step is to find the IP address for host 2. This lookup is performed by DNS, which we will study in Chap. 7. For the moment, we willjust assume that DNS returns the IP address for host2(192.32.65.5). The upper layer software on host 1 now builds a packet with 192.32.65.5 in the Destination address field and gives it to the IP software to transmit. The IP software can lookat the address and see that the destination is onthe CS network, (i.e., its own network). However, it still needs some way to find the destination’s Ethernet address to send the frame. One solution is to have a configuration file somewhere in the system that maps IP addresses onto Ethernet addresses. While 468 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 IP1=192.32.65.7 IP3=192.32.63.3 E1 Ethernet E5 switch Router Host1 E3 E4 Host3 Host2 192.32.65.1 192.32.63.1 Host4 CSNetwork EENetwork E2 192.32.65.0/24 192.32.63.0/24 E6 IP2=192.32.65.5 IP4=192.32.63.8 Source Source Destination Destination Frame IP Eth.

TwoswitchedEthernetLANsjoinedbyarouter. this solution is certainly possible, for organizations with thousands of machines keeping allthese files uptodate isanerror-prone, time-consuming job. A better solution is for host 1 to output a broadcast packet onto the Ethernet asking who owns IP address 192.32.65.5. The broadcast will arrive at every ma- chine on the CS Ethernet, and each one will check its IP address. Host 2 alone will respond with its Ethernet address (E2). In this way host 1 learns that IP ad- dress 192.32.65.5 is on the host with Ethernet address E2. The protocol used for asking this question and getting the reply is called ARP (Address Resolution Protocol). Almost every machine on the Internet runs it. ARP is defined in RFC 826. The advantage of using ARP over configuration files is the simplicity. The system manager does not have to do much except assign each machine an IP ad- dress anddecide aboutsubnetmasks. ARPdoestherest. At this point, the IP software on host 1 builds an Ethernet frame addressed to E2, puts the IP packet (addressed to 192.32.65.5) in the payload field, and dumps it onto the Ethernet. The IP and Ethernet addresses of this packet are given in Fig.5-61. The Ethernet NIC of host 2 detects this frame, recognizes it as a frame foritself, scoopsitup,andcauses an interrupt. The Ethernet driver extracts the IP packet from the payload and passes it to the IP software, which sees that it is cor- rectly addressed andprocesses it. Various optimizations are possible to make ARP work more efficiently. To start with, once a machine has run ARP, it caches the result in case it needs to contact the same machine shortly. Next time it will find the mapping in its own cache, thus eliminating the need for a second broadcast. In many cases, host 2 SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 469 will need to send back a reply, forcing it, too, to run ARP to determine the send- er’s Ethernet address. This ARP broadcast can be avoided by having host 1 in- clude itsIP-to-Ethernet mapping inthe ARP packet. When the ARP broadcast ar- rives at host 2, the pair (192.32.65.7, E1) is entered into host 2’s ARP cache. In fact, allmachines ontheEthernet can enter thismappingintotheir ARPcaches. Toallow mappings to change, for example, when a host is configured touse a new IP address (but keeps its old Ethernet address), entries in the ARP cache should time out after a few minutes. A clever way to help keep the cached infor- mation current and to optimize performance is to have every machine broadcast itsmapping when it isconfigured. Thisbroadcast is generally done inthe form of an ARP lookingforitsownIP address. There shouldnotbearesponse,buta side effect of the broadcast is to make or update an entry in everyone’s ARP cache. This is known as a gratuitous ARP. If a response does (unexpectedly) arrive, two machines have been assigned the same IP address. The error must be resolv- edbythenetwork manager before bothmachines canusethenetwork. Now let us look at Fig', '5-61 again, only this time assume that host 1 wants to send a packet to host 4 (192.32.63.8) on the EE network. Host 1 will see that the destination IP address is not on the CS network. It knows to send all such off-net- work traffic to the router, which is also known as the default gateway. By con- vention, the default gateway is the lowest address on the network (198.31.65.1). To send a frame to the router, host 1 must still know the Ethernet address of the router interface onthe CS network. It discovers this by sending an ARP broadcast for 198.31.65.1, from which it learns E3. It then sends the frame. The same lookup mechanisms are used to send a packet from one router to the next over a sequence ofrouters inanInternet path. When the Ethernet NIC of the router gets this frame, it gives the packet to the IP software. It knows from the network masks that the packet should be sent onto the EE network where it will reach host 4. If the router does not know the Ether- net address for host 4, then it will use ARP again. The table in Fig. 5-61 lists the source and destination Ethernet and IP addresses that are present in the frames as observed on the CS and EE networks. Observe that the Ethernet addresses change with the frame on each network while the IP addresses remain constant (because theyindicate theendpointsacross alloftheinterconnectednetworks). It is also possible to send a packet from host 1 to host 4 without host 1 know- ing that host 4 is on a different network. The solution is to have the router answer ARPs on the CS network for host 4 and give its Ethernet address, E3, as the re- sponse. It is not possible to have host 4 reply directly because it will not see the ARP request (as routers donotforward Ethernet-level broadcasts). The router will then receive frames sent to 192.32.63.8 and forward them onto the EE network. This solution is called proxy ARP. It is used in special cases in which a host wants to appear on a network even though it actually resides on another network. A common situation, for example, is a mobile computer that wants some other nodetopickuppackets foritwhenitisnotonitshomenetwork. 470 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 DHCP—The Dynamic HostConfiguration Protocol ARP (as well as other Internet protocols) makes the assumption that hosts are configured with some basic information, such as their own IP addresses. How do hosts get this information? It is possible to manually configure each computer, but that is tedious and error-prone. There is a better way, and it is called DHCP (Dynamic HostConfiguration Protocol). With DHCP, every network must have a DHCP server that is responsible for configuration. When a computer is started, it has a built-in Ethernet or other link layer address embedded in the NIC, but no IP address. Much like ARP, the com- puter broadcasts a request for an IP address on its network. It does this by using a DHCPDISCOVER packet. Thispacket mustreachthe DHCP server', 'Ifthatserver is not directly attached to the network, the router will be configured to receive DHCP broadcasts andrelay themtotheDHCP server, wherever itislocated. When the server receives the request, it allocates a free IP address and sends it to the host in a DHCP OFFER packet (which again may be relayed via the router). To be able to dothis work even when hosts do not have IP addresses, the server identifies a host using its Ethernet address (which is carried in the DHCP DISCOVER packet) An issue that arises with automatic assignment of IP addresses from a pool is for how long an IP address should be allocated. If a host leaves the network and does not return its IP address to the DHCP server, that address will be perma- nently lost. After a period of time, many addresses may be lost. To prevent that from happening, IP address assignment may be for a fixed period of time, a tech- nique called leasing. Just before the lease expires, the host must ask for a DHCP renewal. If it fails to make a request or the request is denied, the host may no longerusetheIPaddress itwas givenearlier. DHCP is described in RFCs 2131 and 2132. It is widely used in the Internet to configure all sorts of parameters in addition to providing hosts with IP ad- dresses. As well as in business and home networks, DHCP is used by ISPs to set the parameters of devices over the Internet access link, so that customers do not need to phone their ISPs to get this information. Common examples of the infor- mation that is configured include the network mask, the IP address of the default gateway, and the IP addresses of DNS and time servers. DHCP has largely re- placed earlier protocols (called RARP and BOOTP) with more limited func- tionality. 5.6.5 Label Switching and MPLS So far, on our tour of the network layer of the Internet, we have focused exclusively on packets as datagrams that are forwarded by IP routers. There is also another kind of technology that is starting to be widely used, especially by ISPs, in order to move Internet traffic across their networks. This technology is SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 471 called MPLS (MultiProtocol Label Switching) and it is perilously close to cir- cuit switching. Despite the fact that many people in the Internet community have an intense dislike for connection-oriented networking, the idea seems to keep coming back. As Yogi Berra once put it, it is like deja vuall over again. Howev- er, there are essential differences between the way the Internet handles route con- struction and the way connection-oriented networks do it, so the technique is cer- tainly nottraditionalcircuit switching. MPLS adds a label in front of each packet, and forwarding is based on the label rather than on the destination address. Making the label an index into an in- ternal table makes finding the correct output line just a matter of table lookup. Using this technique, forwarding can be done very quickly', 'This advantage was the original motivation behind MPLS, which began as proprietary technology known by various names including tag switching. Eventually, IETF began to standardize the idea. It is described in RFC 3031 and many other RFCs. The main benefits over time have come to be routing that is flexible and forwarding thatissuited toqualityofservice aswell asfast. The first question to ask is where does the label go? Since IP packets were not designed for virtual circuits, there is no field available for virtual-circuit num- berswithintheIPheader. For thisreason, anew MPLS header had tobeadded in front of the IP header. On a router-to-router line using PPP as the framing proto- col, the frame format, including the PPP, MPLS, IP, and TCP headers, is as showninFig.5-62. Headers PPP MPLS IP TCP Userdata CRC Bits 20 3 1 8 Label QoSS TtL Figure5-62. TransmittingaTCPsegmentusingIP,MPLS,andPPP. The generic MPLS header is 4 bytes long and has four fields. Most important is the Label field, which holds the index. The QoS field indicates the class of ser- vice. The S field relates to stacking multiple labels (which is discussed below). The TtL field indicates how many more times the packet may be forwarded. It is decremented at each router, and if it hits 0, the packet is discarded. This feature prevents infinite loopinginthecase ofroutinginstability. MPLS falls between the IP network layer protocol and the PPP link layer pro- tocol. It is not really a layer 3 protocol because it depends on IP or other network 472 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 layer addresses to set up label paths. It is not really a layer 2 protocol either be- cause it forwards packets across multiple hops, not a single link. For this reason, MPLS issometimes described as a layer 2.5protocol. It is an illustrationthat real protocols donotalways fitneatly intoourideal layered protocol model. On the brighter side, because the MPLS headers are not part of the network layer packet orthe data linklayer frame, MPLS istoalarge extent independent of bothlayers. Amongother things, this property means it ispossible tobuildMPLS switches that can forward both IP packets and non-IP packets, depending on what shows up. This feature is where the ‘‘multiprotocol’’ in the name MPLS came from.MPLS can alsocarry IPpackets overnon-IPnetworks. When an MPLS-enhanced packet arrives at aLSR (Label Switched Router), the label is used as an index into a table to determine the outgoing line to use and also the new label to use. This label swapping is used in all virtual-circuit net- works. Labels have only local significance and two different routers can feed un- related packets with the same label into another router for transmission on the same outgoing line. To be distinguishable at the other end, labels have to be remapped at every hop. We saw this mechanism in action in Fig. 5-3. MPLS usesthesame technique. Asan aside, some people distinguishbetween forwarding and switching. For- warding is the process of finding the best match for a destination address in a table to decide where to send packets. An example is the longest matching prefix algorithm used for IP forwarding', 'In contrast, switching uses a label taken from thepacket asanindexintoaforwarding table. Itissimpler andfaster. These defi- nitionsare far fromuniversal, however. Since most hosts and routers do not understand MPLS, we should also ask when and howthe labels are attached topackets. This happens when an IP packet reaches the edge of an MPLS network. The LER (Label Edge Router) inspects the destination IP address and other fields to see which MPLS path the packet should follow, and puts the right label on the front of the packet. Within the MPLS network, this label is used to forward the packet. At the other edge of the MPLS network, the label has served its purpose and is removed, revealing the IP packet again for the next network. This process is shown in Fig.5-63. One dif- ference from traditional virtual circuits is the level of aggregation. It is certainly possible for each flow to have its own set of labels through the MPLS network. However, it is more common for routers togroupmultiple flows that end at a par- ticular router or LAN and use a single label for them. The flows that are grouped together under a single label are said to belong to the same FEC (Forwarding Equivalence Class). This class covers not only where the packets are going, but also their service class (in the differentiated services sense) because all the pack- etsare treated thesame wayforforwarding purposes. With traditional virtual-circuit routing, it is not possible to group several dis- tinct paths with different endpoints onto the same virtual-circuit identifier because there would be no way to distinguish them at the final destination. With MPLS, SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 473 Remove Add label IP label Switchingon IP labelonly Label Label Label IP (tonext network) Labeledge router Labelswitch router Figure5-63. ForwardinganIPpacketthroughanMPLSnetwork. the packets still contain their final destination address, in addition to the label. At the end of the labeled route, the label header can be removed and forwarding can continue theusual way,usingthenetwork layer destination address. Actually, MPLS goes even further. It can operate at multiple levels at once by adding more than one label to the front of a packet. For example, suppose that there are many packets that already have different labels (because we want to treat the packets differently somewhere in the network) that should follow a com- mon path to some destination. Instead of setting up many label switching paths, one for each of the different labels, we can set up a single path. When the al- ready-labeled packets reach the start of this path, another label is added to the front. This is called a stack of labels. The outermost label guides the packets alongthe path. Itisremoved at the endofthe path, and the labels revealed, if any, are used to forward the packet further. The S bit in Fig.5-62 allows a router removing a label to know if there are any additional labels left. It is set to 1 for thebottomlabel and0foralltheother labels', 'The final question we will ask is how the label forwarding tables are set up so that packets follow them. This is one area of major difference between MPLS and conventional virtual-circuit designs. In traditional virtual-circuit networks, when a user wants to establish a connection, a setup packet is launched into the network tocreate the path and make the forwarding table entries. MPLS does not involve users in the setup phase. Requiring users to do anything other than send a datagram wouldbreak toomuchexisting Internet software. Instead, the forwarding information is set up by protocols that are a combina- tion of routing protocols and connection setup protocols. These control protocols are cleanly separated from label forwarding, which allows multiple, different con- trol protocols to be used. One of the variants works like this. When a router is booted,itchecks tosee which routes itisthe final destination for (e.g., which pre- fixes belong to its interfaces). It then creates one or more FECs for them, allo- cates a label for each one, and passes the labels to its neighbors. They, in turn, enter the labels in their forwarding tables and send new labels to their neighbors, until all the routers have acquired the path. Resources can also be reserved as the 474 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 path is constructed to guarantee an appropriate quality of service. Other variants can set up different paths, such as traffic engineering paths that take unused ca- pacity into account, and create paths on-demand to support service offerings such asqualityofservice. Although the basic ideas behind MPLS are straightforward, the details are complicated, with many variations and use cases that are being actively devel- oped. For more information, see Davie and Farrel (2008) and Davie and Rekhter (2000). 5.6.6 OSPF—An Interior Gateway Routing Protocol We have now finished our studyof how packets are forwarded inthe Internet. It is time to move on to the next topic: routing in the Internet. As we mentioned earlier, the Internet is made up of a large number of independent networks or ASes (Autonomous Systems)thatare operated bydifferent organizations, usually a company, university, or ISP. Inside of its own network, an organization can use its own algorithm for internal routing, orintradomain routing,as itismore com- monly known. Nevertheless, there are only a handful of standard protocols that are popular. In this section, we will studythe problem of intradomain routing and look at the OSPF protocol that is widely used in practice. An intradomain routing protocol is also called an interior gateway protocol. In the next section, we will study the problem of routing between independently operated networks, or inter- domain routing. For that case, all networks must use the same interdomain rout- ing protocol or exterior gateway protocol. The protocol that is used in the Inter- netisBGP(Border Gateway Protocol). Early intradomain routing protocols used a distance vector design, based on the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm inherited from the ARPANET. RIP (Rout- ing Information Protocol) is the main example that is used to this day. It works well insmall systems, butlesswell asnetworks getlarger. Italsosuffers fromthe count-to-infinity problem and generally slow convergence', 'The ARPANET switched over to a link state protocol in May 1979becauseofthese problems, and in 1988 IETF began work on a link state protocol for intradomain routing. That protocol, called OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), became a standard in 1990. It drew on a protocol called IS-IS (Intermediate-System to Intermediate-Sys- tem), which became an ISO standard. Because of their shared heritage, the two protocols are much more alike than different. For the complete story, see RFC 2328. They are the dominant intradomain routing protocols, and most router ven- dors now support both of them. OSPF is more widely used in company networks, and IS-IS is more widely used inISP networks. Of the two, we will give a sketch ofhowOSPFworks. Given the long experience with other routing protocols, the group designing OSPF had a long list of requirements that had to be met. First, the algorithm had to be published in the open literature, hence the ‘‘O’’ in OSPF. A proprietary SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 475 solution owned by one company would not do. Second, the new protocol had to support a variety of distance metrics, including physical distance, delay, and so on. Third, it had to be a dynamic algorithm, one that adapted to changes in the topologyautomatically andquickly. Fourth, and new for OSPF, it had to support routing based on type of service. The new protocol had to be able to route real-time traffic one way and other traf- fic a different way. At the time, IP had a Type of service field, but no existing routing protocol used it. This field was included in OSPF butstill nobodyused it, and it was eventually removed. Perhaps this requirement was ahead of its time, as it preceded IETF’s work on differentiated services, which has rejuvenated classes ofservice. Fifth, and related to the above, OSPF had to do load balancing, splitting the load over multiple lines. Most previous protocols sent all packets over a single best route, even if there were two routes that were equally good. The other route was not used at all. In many cases, splitting the load over multiple routes gives better performance. Sixth, support for hierarchical systems was needed. By 1988, some networks had grown so large that no router could be expected to know the entire topology. OSPFhadtobedesigned sothatnorouter wouldhave to. Seventh, some modicum of security was required to prevent fun-loving stu- dents from spoofing routers by sending them false routing information. Finally, provision was needed for dealing with routers that were connected to the Internet viaatunnel. Previous protocols didnothandle thiswell. OSPF supports both point-to-point links (e.g., SONET) and broadcast net- works (e.g., most LANs). Actually, it is able to support networks with multiple routers, each of which can communicate directly with the others (called multiac- cess networks) even if they do not have broadcast capability. Earlier protocols didnothandle thiscase well. Anexample of an autonomous system network is given inFig. 5-64(a). Hosts are omitted because they do not generally play a role in OSPF, while routers and networks (which may contain hosts) do', 'Most of the routers in Fig.5-64(a) are connected to other routers by point-to-point links, and to networks to reach the hosts on those networks. However, routers R3, R4, and R5 are connected by a broadcast LAN suchasswitched Ethernet. OSPF operates by abstracting the collection of actual networks, routers, and links into a directed graph inwhich each arc is assigned a weight (distance, delay, etc.). A point-to-point connection between two routers is represented by a pair of arcs, one in each direction. Their weights may be different. A broadcast network is represented by a node for the network itself, plus a node for each router. The arcs from that network node to the routers have weight 0. They are important nonetheless, as without them there is no path through the network. Other net- works, which have only hosts, have only an arc reaching them and not one re- turning. Thisstructure givesroutes tohosts,butnotthroughthem. 476 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 R1 R3 R5 LAN1 LAN4 LAN3 LAN2 R2 R4 (a) 5 LAN1 R1 R3 3 R5 LAN4 5 0 1 5 0 4 4 4 7 LAN1 3 8 0 1 R4 LAN2 R2 (b) Figure5-64. (a)Anautonomoussystem.(b)Agraphrepresentationof(a). Figure 5-64(b) shows the graph representation of the network of Fig. 5-64(a). What OSPF fundamentally does is represent the actual network as a graph like this and then use the link state method to have every router compute the shortest path from itself to all other nodes. Multiple paths may be found that are equally short. In this case, OSPF remembers the set of shortest paths and during packet forwarding, traffic is split across them. This helps to balance load. It is called ECMP (Equal CostMultiPath). Many of the ASes in the Internet are themselves large and nontrivial to man- age. To work at this scale, OSPF allows an AS to be divided into numbered areas, where an area is a network or a set of contiguous networks. Areas do not overlap but need not be exhaustive, that is, some routers may belong to no area. Routers that lie wholly within an area are called internal routers. An area is a generalization of an individual network. Outside an area, its destinations are visi- blebutnotitstopology. Thischaracteristic helpsroutingtoscale. Every AS has a backbone area, called area 0. The routers in this area are called backbone routers. All areas are connected to the backbone, possibly by tunnels, so it is possible to gofrom any area in the AS to any other area in the AS via the backbone. A tunnel is represented in the graph as just another arc with a cost. As with other areas, the topology of the backbone is not visible outside the backbone. Each router that is connected to two or more areas is called an area border router. It must also be part of the backbone. The job of an area border router is tosummarize thedestinations inonearea andtoinject thissummary intothe other SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 477 areas to which it is connected. This summary includes cost information butnot all the details ofthe topologywithin an area', 'Passing cost information allows hosts in other areas to find the best area border router to use to enter an area. Not passing topologyinformation reduces traffic and simplifies the shortest-path computations of routers in other areas. However, if there is only one border router out of an area, even the summary does not need to be passed. Routes to destinations out of the area always start with the instruction ‘‘Go to the border router.’’ This kind of area iscalled astub area. The last kind of router is the AS boundary router. It injects routes to exter- nal destinations on other ASes into the area. The external routes then appear as destinations that can be reached via the AS boundary router with some cost. An external route can be injected at one or more AS boundary routers. The relation- ship between ASes, areas, and the various kinds of routers is shown in Fig.5-65. One router may play multiple roles, for example, a border router is also a back- bonerouter. Areaborder Backbone ASboundary Internal router router router router One autonomous system Area2(stub) Area0(backbone) Area1 Figure5-65. TherelationbetweenASes,backbones,andareasinOSPF. During normal operation, each router within an area has the same link state database and runs the same shortest path algorithm. Its main job is to calculate the shortest path from itself to every other router and network in the entire AS. Anarea border router needs the databases forall theareas towhichitisconnected andmustruntheshortest pathalgorithm foreacharea separately. For a source and destination in the same area, the best intra-area route (that lies wholly within the area) is chosen. For a source and destination in different areas, the inter-area route must go from the source to the backbone, across the backbone to the destination area, and then to the destination. This algorithm forces a star configuration on OSPF, with the backbone being the hub and the other areas being spokes. Because the route with the lowest cost is chosen, rout- ers in different parts of the network may use different area border routers to enter the backbone and destination area. Packets are routed from source to destination ‘‘as is.’’ They are not encapsulated or tunneled (unless going to an area whose 478 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 only connection to the backbone is a tunnel). Also, routes to external destinations may include the external cost from the AS boundaryrouter over the external path, ifdesired, orjustthecostinternal totheAS. When a router boots, it sends HELLO messages on all of its point-to-point lines and multicasts them onLANs to the groupconsisting ofall the other routers. From the responses, each router learns who its neighbors are. Routers on the same LAN are allneighbors. OSPF works by exchanging information between adjacent routers, which is notthe same asbetween neighboringrouters. Inparticular, itisinefficient tohave every router ona LAN talk toevery other router onthe LAN. To avoid this situa- tion, one router is elected as the designated router. It is said to be adjacent to all the other routers on its LAN, and exchanges information with them. In effect, it is acting as the single node that represents the LAN', 'Neighboring routers that are not adjacent do not exchange information with each other. A backup de- signated router is always kept up to date to ease the transition should the primary designated router crash andneed tobereplacedimmediately. During normal operation, each router periodically floods LINK STATE UPDATE messages to each of its adjacent routers. These messages gives its state andprovide the costs used inthe topologicaldatabase. The floodingmessages are acknowledged,tomake them reliable. Each message hasasequence number, soa router can see whether an incoming LINK STATE UPDATE is older or newer than what it currently has. Routers also send these messages when a link goes up or downoritscostchanges. DATABASE DESCRIPTION messages give the sequence numbers of all the link state entries currently held by the sender. By comparing its own values with those of the sender, the receiver can determine who has the most recent values. These messages are usedwhenalinkisbroughtup. Either partner can request link state information from the other one by using LINKSTATEREQUEST messages. The result ofthis algorithm isthat eachpair of adjacent routers checks to see who has the most recent data, and new information is spread throughout the area this way. All these messages are sent directly in IP packets. Thefive kindsofmessages are summarized inFig.5-66.

ThefivetypesofOSPFmessages. SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 479 Finally, we can put all the pieces together. Using flooding, each router informs all the other routers in its area of its links to other routers and networks and the cost of these links. This information allows each router to construct the graph for its area(s) and compute the shortest paths. The backbone area does this work, too. In addition, the backbone routers accept information from the area border routers in order to compute the best route from each backbone router to every other router. This information ispropagated back tothe area border routers, which advertise it within their areas. Using this information, internal routers can select the best route to a destination outside their area, including the best exit router tothebackbone. 5.6.7 BGP—The Exterior Gateway Routing Protocol Within a single AS, OSPF and IS-IS are the protocols that are commonly used. Between ASes, a different protocol, called BGP (Border Gateway Proto- col), is used. A different protocol is needed because the goals of an intradomain protocol and an interdomain protocol are not the same. All an intradomain proto- colhastodoismovepackets asefficiently aspossiblefromthe source tothe dest- ination. Itdoesnothave toworryaboutpolitics. In contrast, interdomain routing protocols have to worry about politics a great deal (Metz, 2001). For example, a corporate AS might want the ability to send packets to any Internet site and receive packets from any Internet site. However, it might be unwilling to carry transit packets originating in a foreign AS and end- ing in a different foreign AS, even if its own AS is on the shortest path between the two foreign ASes (‘‘That’s their problem, not ours’’)', 'On the other hand, it might be willingto carry transit traffic for its neighbors, or even for specific other ASes that paid it for this service. Telephone companies, for example, might be happy to act as carriers for their customers, but not for others. Exterior gateway protocols in general, and BGP in particular, have been designed to allow many kindsofroutingpolicies tobeenforced intheinterAS traffic. Typical policies involve political, security, or economic considerations. A few examples ofpossibleroutingconstraints are: 1. Donotcarry commercial traffic ontheeducational network. 2. Never sendtraffic fromthePentagononaroutethroughIraq. 3. Use TeliaSonera instead ofVerizon becauseitischeaper. 4. Don’tuseAT&T inAustralia becauseperformance ispoor. 5. Traffic starting orendingatApple shouldnottransit Google. As you might imagine from this list, routing policies can be highly individual. They are often proprietary because they contain sensitive business information. 480 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 However, we can describe some patterns that capture the reasoning of the com- panyaboveandthatare often usedasastarting point. Arouting policy isimplemented bydeciding what traffic can flow over which ofthe linksbetween ASes. One common policy isthatacustomer ISP paysanoth- er provider ISP to deliver packets to any other destination on the Internet and re- ceive packets sent from any other destination. The customer ISP is said to buy transit service fromtheprovider ISP. Thisisjustlike acustomer at home buying Internet access service from an ISP. To make it work, the provider should adver- tise routestoalldestinations ontheInternet tothe customer over the linkthat con- nects them. In this way, the customer will have a route to use to send packets anywhere. Conversely, the customer should advertise routes only to the destina- tions on its network to the provider. This will let the provider send traffic to the customer onlyforthoseaddresses; thecustomer doesnotwant tohandle traffic in- tended forotherdestinations. We can see an example of transit service in Fig.5-67. There are four ASes that are connected. The connection is often made with a link at IXPs (Internet eXchange Points), facilities to which many ISPs have a link for the purpose of connecting with other ISPs. AS2, AS3, and AS4 are customers of AS1. They buy transit service from it. Thus, when source A sends to destination C, the packets travel from AS2 to AS1 and finally to AS4. The routing advertisements travel in the opposite direction tothe packets. AS4 advertises C as a destination to its tran- sit provider, AS1, to let sources reach C via AS1. Later, AS1 advertises a route to C to its other customers, including AS2, to let the customers know that they can sendtraffic toCviaAS1. AS1 Routingpolicy: TR=Transit PathofBGProuting CU=Customer advertisements(dash) PE=Peer TR CU TR CU TR CU AS4 AS2 AS3 PathofIP packets(solid) PE PE A B C Figure5-67. Routingpoliciesbetweenfourautonomoussystems. InFig.5-67,all ofthe other ASes buytransit service fromAS1. This provides them with connectivity so they can interact with any host on the Internet. Howev- er, they have to pay for this privilege. Suppose that AS2 and AS3 exchange a lot of traffic. Given that their networks are connected already, if they want to, they SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 481 can use a different policy—they can send traffic directly to each other for free', 'This will reduce the amount of traffic they must have AS1 deliver on their behalf, andhopefullyitwillreduce their bills.Thispolicyiscalled peering. To implement peering, two ASes send routing advertisements to each other forthe addresses that reside intheir networks. Doingsomakes itpossible forAS2 to send AS3 packets from A destined to B and vice versa. However, note that peering is not transitive. In Fig. 5-67, AS3 and AS4 also peer with eachother. This peering allows traffic from C destined for B to be sent directly to AS4. What hap- pens if C sends a packet to A? AS3 is only advertising a route to B to AS4. It is not advertising a route to A. The consequence is that traffic will not pass from AS4 to AS3 to AS2, even though a physical path exists. This restriction is exactly what AS3 wants. It peers with AS4 to exchange traffic, but does not want to carry traffic from AS4tootherparts oftheInternet since itisnotbeingpaidtosodo.In- stead, AS4gets transit service fromAS1. Thus, itisAS1whowillcarry the packet fromCtoA. Now that we know about transit and peering, we can also see that A, B, and C have transit arrangements. For example, A must buy Internet access from AS2. A might be a single home computer or a company network with many LANs. How- ever, it does not need to run BGP because it is a stub network that is connected tothe rest ofthe Internet byonlyonelink. Sothe onlyplaceforit tosend packets destined outside of the network is over the link to AS2. There is nowhere else to go. This path can be arranged simply by setting up a default route. For this rea- son, we have not shown A, B, and C as ASes that participate in interdomain rout- ing. On the other hand, some company networks are connected to multiple ISPs. This technique is used to improve reliability, since if the path through one ISP fails, the company can use the path via the other ISP. This technique is called multihoming. In this case, the company network is likely to run an interdomain routing protocol (e.g., BGP) to tell other ASes which addresses should be reached viawhich ISPlinks. Many variations onthese transit and peering policies are possible, but they al- ready illustrate how business relationships and control over where route advertise- ments go can implement different kinds of policies. Now we will consider in more detail how routers running BGP advertise routes to each other and select pathsoverwhich toforward packets. BGP is a form of distance vector protocol, but it is quite unlike intradomain distance vector protocols such as RIP. We have already seen that policy, instead of minimum distance, is used to pick which routes to use. Another large dif- ference is that instead of maintaining just the cost of the route toeach destination, eachBGProuter keeps track ofthe path used. This approach iscalled apath vec- tor protocol. The path consists ofthe next hoprouter (which may beonthe other sideoftheISP, notadjacent)and the sequence ofASes, orAS path,that the route has followed (given in reverse order). Finally, pairs of BGP routers communicate 482 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP', '5 witheachother byestablishing TCP connections. Operating thisway provides re- liable communication and also hides all the details of the network being passed through. An example of how BGP routes are advertised is shown in Fig. 5-68. There are three ASes and themiddle oneisprovidingtransit totheleft andrightISPs. A route advertisement to prefix C starts in AS3. When it is propagated across the link to R2c at the top of the figure, it has the AS path of simply AS3 and the next hoprouter ofR3a. Atthe bottom, it has the same AS path butadifferent next hop becauseit came across adifferent link. Thisadvertisement continues topropagate and crosses the boundary into AS1. At router R1a, at the top of the figure, the AS pathisAS2,AS3andthenexthopisR2a.

PropagationofBGProuteadvertisements. Carrying the complete path with the route makes it easy for the receiving router to detect and break routing loops. The rule is that each router that sends a route outside ofthe AS prepends its ownAS number tothe route. (This is why the list is in reverse order.) When a router receives a route, it checks to see if its own AS number is already in the AS path. If it is, a loop has been detected and the advertisement is discarded. However, and somewhat ironically, it was realized in the late 1990s that despite this precaution BGP suffers from a version of the count-to-infinity problem (Labovitz et al., 2001). There are no long-lived loops, butroutes can sometimes beslowtoconvergeandhavetransient loops. Giving a list of ASes is a very coarse way to specify a path. An AS might be asmall company, oraninternational backbonenetwork. There isnowayoftelling from the route. BGP does not even try because different ASes may use different intradomain protocols whose costs cannot be compared. Even if they could be compared, an AS may not want to reveal its internal metrics. This is one of the ways thatinterdomain routingprotocols differ fromintradomain protocols. SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 483 So far we have seen howaroute advertisement is sent across the link between two ISPs. We still need some way to propagate BGP routes from one side of the ISPtotheother, sotheycanbe sent ontothe next ISP. Thistask could be handled bythe intradomain protocol, but because BGP is very goodat scaling tolarge net- works, a variant of BGP is often used. It is called iBGP (internal BGP) to distin- guishitfromtheregular useofBGPaseBGP (external BGP). The ruleforpropagating routes inside an ISP isthat every router at the bound- ary of the ISP learns of all the routes seen by all the other boundary routers, for consistency. If one boundary router on the ISP learns of a prefix to IP 128.208.0.0/16, all the other routers will learn of this prefix. The prefix will then be reachable from all parts of the ISP, no matter how packets enter the ISP from other ASes', 'We have not shown this propagation in Fig.5-68 to avoid clutter, but, for ex- ample, router R2b will know that it can reach C via either router R2c at top or router R2d at bottom. The next hop is updated as the route crosses within the ISP so that routers on the far side of the ISP know which router to use to exit the ISP on the other side. This can be seen in the leftmost routes in which the next hop pointstoarouter inthesame ISPandnotarouter inthenextISP. We can now describe the key missing piece, which is how BGP routers choose which route to use for each destination. Each BGP router may learn a route for a given destination from the router it is connected to in the next ISP and from all of the other boundaryrouters (which have heard different routes from the routers they are connected to in other ISPs). Each router must decide which route in this set of routes is the best one to use. Ultimately the answer is that it is up to the ISP to write some policy to pick the preferred route. However, this explana- tion is very general and not at all satisfying, so we can at least describe some commonstrategies. The first strategy is that routes via peered networks are chosen in preference to routes via transit providers. The former are free; the latter cost money. A simi- lar strategy is that customer routes are given the highest preference. It is only goodbusiness tosendtraffic directly tothepayingcustomers. A different kindof strategy is the default rule that shorter AS paths are better. This is debatable given that an AS could be a network of any size, so a path through three small ASes could actually be shorter than a path through one big AS. However, shorter tends to be better on average, and this rule is a common tiebreaker. The final strategy istoprefer the route that has the lowest cost within the ISP. This is the strategy implemented in Fig.5-68. Packets sent from A to C exit AS1 at the top router, R1a. Packets sent from B exit via the bottom router, R1b. The reason is that bothA and B are taking the lowest-cost path or quickest route outof AS1. Because they are located in different parts of the ISP, the quickest exit for each one is different. The same thing happens as the packets pass through AS2. Onthelast leg,AS3hastocarry thepacket fromBthroughitsownnetwork. 484 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 This strategy is known as early exit or hot-potato routing. It has the curious side effect of tending to make routes asymmetric. For example, consider the path taken when C sends a packet back to B. The packet will exit AS3 quickly, at the top router, to avoid wasting its resources. Similarly, it will stay at the top when AS2 passes it to AS1 as quickly as possible. Then the packet will have a longer journey inAS1. Thisisamirror image ofthepathtaken fromBtoC. The abovediscussion shouldmake clear thateachBGP router choosesitsown best route from the known possibilities', 'It is not the case, as might naively be ex- pected, that BGP chooses a path to follow at the AS level and OSPF chooses paths within each of the ASes. BGP and the interior gateway protocol are integrated much more deeply. This means that, for example, BGP can find the best exit point from one ISP to the next and this point will vary across the ISP, as in the case of the hot-potato policy. It also means that BGP routers in different parts of one AS may choose different AS paths to reach the same destination. Care must be exercised by the ISP to configure all of the BGP routers to make compatible choices givenallofthisfreedom, butthiscan bedoneinpractice. Amazingly, we have only scratched the surface of BGP. For more infor- mation, see the BGP version 4 specification in RFC 4271 and related RFCs. However, realize that much of its complexity lies with policies, which are not de- scribed inthespecification oftheBGPprotocol. 5.6.8 Internet Multicasting Normal IP communication is between one sender and one receiver. However, for some applications, it is useful for a process to be able to send to a large num- ber of receivers simultaneously. Examples are streaming a live sports event to many viewers, delivering program updates to a pool of replicated servers, and handlingdigital conference (i.e., multiparty)telephonecalls. IPsupportsone-to-many communication, ormulticasting,using class DIP ad- dresses. Each class D address identifies a group of hosts. Twenty-eight bits are available for identifying groups, so over 250 million groups can exist at the same time. When a process sends a packet to a class D address, a best-effort attempt is made to deliver it to all the members of the group addressed, but no guarantees are given. Some members maynotgetthepacket. The range of IP addresses 224.0.0.0/24 is reserved for multicast on the local network. In this case, no routing protocol is needed. The packets are multicast by simply broadcasting them on the LAN with a multicast address. All hosts on the LAN receive the broadcasts, and hosts that are members of the group process the packet. Routers do not forward the packet off the LAN. Some examples of local multicastaddresses are: 224.0.0.1 Allsystems onaLAN 224.0.0.2 Allrouters onaLAN 224.0.0.5 AllOSPFrouters onaLAN 224.0.0.251AllDNSservers onaLAN SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 485 Other multicast addresses may have members on different networks. In this case, a routing protocol is needed. But first the multicast routers need to know which hosts are members of a group. A process asks its host to join in a specific group. It can also ask its host to leave the group. Each host keeps track of which groups its processes currently belong to. When the last process on a host leaves a group, the host is no longer a member of that group. About once a minute, each multicast router sends a query packet to all the hosts on its LAN (using the local multicast address of 224.0.0.1, of course) asking them to report back on the groups to which they currently belong', 'The multicast routers may or may not be colocated with the standard routers. Each host sends back responses for all the class D addresses it is interested in. These query and response packets use a pro- tocol called IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol). It is described in RFC 3376. Any of several multicast routing protocols may be used to build multicast spanning trees that give paths from senders to all of the members of the group. The algorithms that are used are the ones we described in Sec. 5.2.8. Within an AS, the main protocol used is PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast). PIM comes in several flavors. In Dense Mode PIM, a pruned reverse path forwarding tree is created. This is suited to situations in which members are everywhere in the network, such as distributing files to many servers within a data center net- work. In Sparse Mode PIM, spanning trees that are builtare similar tocore-based trees. This is suited to situations such as a content provider multicasting TV to subscribers on its IP network. A variant of this design, called Source-Specific MulticastPIM, is optimized forthe case that there isonlyone sender tothe group. Finally, multicastextensions toBGP ortunnelsneed tobeusedtocreate multicast routeswhenthegroupmembers are inmore thanoneAS. 5.6.9 Mobile IP Many users of the Internet have mobile computers and want tostay connected when they are away from home and even on the road in between. Unfortunately, the IP addressing system makes working far from home easier said than done, as we will describe shortly. When people began demanding the ability anyway, IETF set upaWorking Grouptofindasolution. The Working Groupquickly for- mulated a number of goals considered desirable in any solution. The major ones were: 1. Each mobilehostmustbeable touseitshomeIPaddress anywhere. 2. Software changes tothefixed hostswere notpermitted. 3. Changes totherouter software andtables were notpermitted. 4. Mostpackets formobile hostsshouldnotmake detoursontheway. 5. Nooverhead shouldbeincurred whenamobile hostisathome. 486 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 The solution chosen was the one described in Sec. 5.2.10. In brief, every site that wants to allow its users to roam has to create a helper at the site called a home agent. When a mobile host shows up at a foreign site, it obtains a new IP address (called a care-of address) at the foreign site. The mobile then tells the home agent where it is now by giving it the care-of address. When a packet for the mobile arrives at the home site and the mobile is elsewhere, the home agent grabs the packet and tunnels it to the mobile at the current care-of address. The mobile can send reply packets directly to whoever it is communicating with, but still using its home address as the source address. This solution meets all the re- quirements stated aboveexcept thatpackets formobile hostsdomake detours. Now that we have covered the network layer of the Internet, we can go into the solution in more detail. The need for mobility support inthe first place comes from the IP addressing scheme itself. Every IP address contains a network num- ber and a host number. For example, consider the machine with IP address 160.80.40.20/16', 'The 160.80 gives the network number; the 40.20 is the host number. Routers allovertheworldhave routingtables tellingwhich linktouseto get tonetwork 160.80. Whenever a packet comes inwith a destination IP address of the form 160.80.xxx.yyy, it goes out on that line. If all of a sudden, the ma- chine with that address is carted off to some distant site, the packets for it will continue toberouted toitshomeLAN (orrouter). At this stage, there are two options—both unattractive. The first is that we could create a route to a more specific prefix. That is, if the distant site advertises a route to160.80.40.20/32, packets sent to the destination will start arriving in the right place again. This option depends on the longest matching prefix algorithm that isused at routers. However, we have added aroute toanIP prefix with a sin- gle IP address in it. All ISPs in the world will learn about this prefix. If everyone changes global IP routes in this way when they move their computer, each router would have millions of table entries, at astronomical cost to the Internet. This optionisnotworkable. The second option is to change the IP address of the mobile. True, packets sent to the home IP address will no longer be delivered until all the relevant peo- ple, programs, and databases are informed of the change. But the mobile can still use the Internet at the new location to browse the Web and run other applications. This optionhandles mobilityat a higher layer. It is what typically happens when a user takes a laptop to a coffee store and uses the Internet via the local wireless network. The disadvantage is that it breaks some applications, and it does not keep connectivityasthemobile movesaround. As an aside, mobility can also be handled at a lower layer, the link layer. This is what happens when using a laptop on a single 802.11 wireless network. The IP address of the mobile does not change and the network path remains the same. It is the wireless link that is providing mobility. However, the degree of mobility is limited. If the laptop moves too far, it will have to connect to the Internet via an- other network withadifferent IPaddress. SEC. 5.6 THENETWORK LAYERINTHEINTERNET 487 The mobile IP solution for IPv4 is given in RFC 3344. It works with the existing Internet routing and allows hosts to stay connected with their own IP ad- dresses as they move about. For it to work, the mobile must be able to discover when it has moved. This is accomplished with ICMP router advertisement and solicitation messages. Mobiles listen for periodic router advertisements or send a solicitation to discover the nearest router. If this router is not the usual address of the router when the mobile is at home, it must be on a foreign network. If this router has changed since last time, the mobile has moved to another foreign net- work. Thissame mechanism lets mobile hostsfindtheir homeagents. To get a care-of IP address on the foreign network, a mobile can simply use DHCP', 'Alternatively, if IPv4 addresses are in short supply, the mobile can send and receive packets via a foreign agent that already has an IP address on the net- work. The mobile host finds a foreign agent using the same ICMP mechanism usedtofindthe home agent. After the mobile obtains an IPaddress orfindsa for- eign agent, it is able to use the network to send a message to its home agent, informingthehomeagent ofitscurrent location. The home agent needs a way to intercept packets sent to the mobile only when the mobile is not at home. ARP provides a convenient mechanism. To send a packet over an Ethernet to an IP host, the router needs to know the Ethernet ad- dress of the host. The usual mechanism is for the router to send an ARP query to ask, for example, what is the Ethernet address of 160.80.40.20. When the mobile is at home, it answers ARP queries for its IP address with its own Ethernet ad- dress. When the mobile is away, the home agent responds to this query by giving its Ethernet address. The router then sends packets for 160.80.40.20 to the home agent. Recallthat thisiscalled aproxyARP. To quickly update ARP mappings back and forth when the mobile leaves home or arrives back home, another ARP technique called a gratuitous ARP can be used. Basically, the mobile or home agent send themselves an ARP query for the mobile IP address that supplies the right answer so that the router notices and updatesitsmapping. Tunnelingtosend apacket between the home agent andthe mobile host at the care-of address is done by encapsulating the packet with another IP header des- tined for the care-of address. When the encapsulated packet arrives at the care-of address, theouterIPheader isremoved toreveal thepacket. As with many Internet protocols, the devil is in the details, and most often the details of compatibility with other protocols that are deployed. There are two complications. First, NAT boxes depend on peeking past the IP header to look at the TCP or UDP header. The original form of tunneling for mobile IP did not use these headers, soitdidnotworkwith NAT boxes. The solution was tochange the encapsulation toinclude aUDPheader. The second complication is that some ISPs check the source IP addresses of packets to see that they match where the routing protocol believes the source should be located. This technique is called ingress filtering, and it is a security 488 THENETWORK LAYER CHAP. 5 measure intended to discard traffic with seemingly incorrect addresses that may bemalicious. However, packets sent fromthe mobile toother Internet hostswhen it isonaforeign network willhave asource IPaddress thatisoutofplace,sothey will be discarded. To get around this problem, the mobile can use the care-of ad- dress as a source to tunnel the packets back to the home agent. From here, they are sent into the Internet from what appears to be the right location. The cost is thattheroute ismore roundabout. Another issue we have not discussed is security', 'When a home agent gets a message asking it toplease forward all of Roberta’s packets tosome IP address, it had better not comply unless it is convinced that Roberta is the source of this re- quest, and not somebody trying to impersonate her. Cryptographic authentication protocols are usedforthispurpose. We willstudysuchprotocols inChap. 8. Mobility protocols for IPv6 build on the IPv4 foundation. The scheme above suffers from the triangle routing problem in which packets sent to the mobile take a dogleg through a distant home agent. In IPv6, route optimization is used to fol- low a direct path between the mobile and other IP addresses after the initial pack- etshave followed thelongroute. Mobile IPv6isdefined inRFC 3775. There is another kind of mobility that is also being defined for the Internet. Some airplanes have built-in wireless networking that passengers can use to con- nect their laptops to the Internet. The plane has a router that connects to the rest of the Internet via a wireless link. (Did you expect a wired link?) So now we have a flying router, which means that the whole network is mobile. Network mobility designs support this situation without the laptops realizing that the plane is mobile. As far as they are concerned, it is just another network. Of course, some of the laptops may be using mobile IP to keep their home addresses while they are on the plane, so we have two levels of mobility. Network mobility is de- fined forIPv6inRFC 3963. 5.7 SUMMARY The network layer provides services to the transport layer. It can be based on either datagrams or virtual circuits. In both cases, its main job is routing packets from the source to the destination. In datagram networks, a routing decision is made onevery packet. In virtual-circuit networks, it is made when the virtual cir- cuitissetup. Manyroutingalgorithms are used incomputer networks. Floodingisa simple algorithm to send a packet along all paths. Most algorithms find the shortest path and adapt to changes in the network topology. The main algorithms are distance vector routing and link state routing. Most actual networks use one of these. Other important routing topics are the use of hierarchy in large networks, routing formobile hosts,andbroadcast, multicast,andanycast routing. SEC. 5.7 SUMMARY 489 Networks can easily become congested, leading to increased delay and lost packets. Network designers attempt toavoid congestionbydesigning the network to have enough capacity, choosing uncongested routes, refusing to accept more traffic, signaling sources toslowdown,andshedding load. The next step beyond just dealing with congestion is to actually try to achieve a promised quality of service. Some applications care more about throughput whereas others care more about delay and jitter. The methods that can be used to provide different qualities of service include a combination of traffic shaping, reserving resources at routers, and admission control. Approaches that have been designed for good quality of service include IETF integrated services (including RSVP) anddifferentiated services. Networks differ in various ways, so when multiple networks are intercon- nected, problems can occur. When different networks have different maximum packet sizes, fragmentation may be needed', 'Different networks may run different routing protocols internally but need to run a common protocol externally. Some- times the problems can be finessed by tunneling a packet through a hostile net- work,butifthesource anddestination networks are different, thisapproach fails. The Internet has a rich variety of protocols related to the network layer. These include the datagram protocol, IP, and associated control protocols such as ICMP, ARP, and DHCP. A connection-oriented protocol called MPLS carries IP packets across some networks. Oneofthemainroutingprotocols usedwithinnet- works is OSPF, and the routing protocol used across networks is BGP. The Inter- net is rapidly running out of IP addresses, so a new version of IP, IPv6, has been developed andisever-so-slowly beingdeployed. PROBLEMS 1.

The network layer provides end-to-end packet delivery using data- grams or virtual circuits. The transport layer builds on the network layer to pro- vide data transport from a process on a source machine to a process on a destina- tion machine with a desired level of reliability that is independent of the physical networks currently in use. It provides the abstractions that applications need to use the network. Without the transport layer, the whole concept of layered proto- cols would make little sense. In this chapter, we will study the transport layer in detail, including its services and choice of API design to tackle issues of reliabil- ity, connections and congestion control, protocols such as TCP andUDP, and per- formance. 6.1 THE TRANSPORT SERVICE In the following sections, we will provide an introduction to the transport ser- vice. We look at what kind of service is provided to the application layer. To make the issue of transport service more concrete, we will examine two sets of transport layer primitives. First comes asimple (buthypothetical)onetoshowthe basic ideas. Then comes theinterfacecommonlyusedintheInternet. 495 496 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 6.1.1 Services Provided to the Upper Layers The ultimate goal of the transport layer is to provide efficient, reliable, and cost-effective data transmission service to its users, normally processes in the ap- plication layer. To achieve this, the transport layer makes use of the services pro- vided by the network layer. The software and/or hardware within the transport layer that does the work is called the transport entity. The transport entity can be located in the operating system kernel, inalibrary package boundintonetwork applications, in a separate user process, or even on the network interface card. The first two options are most common on the Internet. The (logical) relationship ofthenetwork, transport, andapplication layers isillustratedinFig.6-1.

Thenetwork,transport,andapplicationlayers. Just as there are two types of network service, connection-oriented and con- nectionless, there are also twotypes oftransport service. The connection-oriented transport service is similar to the connection-oriented network service in many ways. In both cases, connections have three phases: establishment, data transfer, and release. Addressing and flow control are also similar in both layers. Fur- thermore, the connectionless transport service is also very similar to the con- nectionless network service', 'However, note that it can be difficult to provide a connectionless transport service on top of a connection-oriented network service, since it is inefficient toset upa connection to send a single packet and then tear it downimmediately afterwards. The obvious question is this: if the transport layer service is so similar to the network layer service, why are there two distinct layers? Why is one layer not SEC. 6.1 THETRANSPORT SERVICE 497 adequate? The answer is subtle, but crucial. The transport code runs entirely on the users’ machines, but the network layer mostly runs on the routers, which are operated by the carrier (at least for a wide area network). What happens if the network layer offers inadequate service? What if it frequently loses packets? What happens ifrouters crash fromtimetotime? Problems occur, that’s what. The users have no real control over the network layer, so they cannot solve the problem of poor service by using better routers or puttingmore error handling inthe data link layer becausethey don’townthe rout- ers. The only possibility is to put on top of the network layer another layer that improves the quality of the service. If, in a connectionless network, packets are lost or mangled, the transport entity can detect the problem and compensate for it by using retransmissions. If, in a connection-oriented network, a transport entity is informed halfway through a long transmission that its network connection has been abruptly terminated, withnoindication ofwhat has happened tothe data cur- rently in transit, it can set up a new network connection to the remote transport entity. Using this new network connection, it can send a query to its peer asking which data arrived and which did not, and knowing where it was, pick up from where itleft off. In essence, the existence of the transport layer makes it possible for the tran- sport service to be more reliable than the underlying network. Furthermore, the transport primitives can be implemented as calls to library procedures to make them independent of the network primitives. The network service calls may vary considerably from one network to another (e.g., calls based on a connectionless Ethernet may be quite different from calls on a connection-oriented WiMAX net- work). Hiding the network service behind a set of transport service primitives ensures that changing the network merely requires replacing one set of library procedures with another one that does the same thing with a different underlying service. Thankstothetransport layer, application programmers can write code accord- ingtoastandard set ofprimitivesandhave these programs workonawide variety of networks, without having to worry about dealing with different network inter- faces and levels of reliability. If all real networks were flawless and all had the same service primitives and were guaranteed never, ever to change, the transport layer might not be needed. However, in the real world it fulfills the key function ofisolating the upper layers from the technology, design, and imperfections of the network', 'For this reason, many people have made a qualitative distinction between lay- ers 1 through 4 on the one hand and layer(s) above 4 on the other. The bottom four layers can be seen as the transport service provider, whereas the upper layer(s) are the transport service user. This distinction of provider versus user has a considerable impact on the design of the layers and puts the transport layer inakey position,since it forms the major boundarybetween the provideranduser ofthereliable data transmission service. Itisthelevel thatapplications see. 498 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 6.1.2 Transport Service Primitives Toallow userstoaccessthetransport service, the transport layer mustprovide some operations to application programs, that is, a transport service interface. Each transport service has its own interface. In this section, we will first examine a simple (hypothetical) transport service and its interface to see the bare essen- tials. Inthefollowing section, wewilllookatareal example. The transport service issimilar tothe network service, butthere are also some important differences. The main difference is that the network service is intended to model the service offered by real networks, warts and all. Real networks can losepackets, sothenetwork service isgenerally unreliable. The connection-oriented transport service, in contrast, is reliable. Of course, real networks are not error-free, but that is precisely the purpose of the transport layer—to provide areliable service ontopofanunreliable network. As an example, consider two processes on a single machine connected by a pipe in UNIX (or any other interprocess communication facility). They assume the connection between them is 100% perfect. They do not want to know about acknowledgements, lost packets, congestion, or anything at all like that. What they want is a 100% reliable connection. Process A puts data into one end of the pipe, and process B takes it out of the other. This is what the connection-oriented transport service is all about—hiding the imperfections of the network service so that user processes can just assume the existence of an error-free bit stream even whentheyare ondifferent machines. As an aside, the transport layer can also provide unreliable (datagram) ser- vice. However, there isrelatively littletosayaboutthat besides ‘‘it’sdatagrams,’’ so we will mainly concentrate on the connection-oriented transport service in this chapter. Nevertheless, there are some applications, such as client-server comput- ing and streaming multimedia, that build on a connectionless transport service, andwewillsayalittlebitaboutthatlater on. A second difference between the network service and transport service is whom the services are intended for. The network service is used onlybythe tran- sport entities. Few users write their own transport entities, and thus few users or programs ever see thebare network service. Incontrast, manyprograms (andthus programmers) see the transport primitives. Consequently, the transport service mustbeconvenientandeasy touse. To get an idea of what a transport service might be like, consider the five primitives listed in Fig. 6-2. This transport interface is truly bare bones, but it gives the essential flavor of what a connection-oriented transport interface has to do. It allows application programs to establish, use, and then release connections, whichissufficient formanyapplications. Tosee howthese primitivesmight be used, consider anapplication with aser- ver and a number of remote clients', 'To start with, the server executes a LISTEN primitive, typically by calling a library procedure that makes a system call that SEC. 6.1 THETRANSPORT SERVICE 499 Primitive Packetsent Meaning LISTEN (none) Blockuntilsomeprocesstriestoconnect CONNECT CONNECTION REQ.

Theprimitivesforasimpletransportservice. blocks the server until a client turns up. When a client wants to talk to the server, it executes aCONNECT primitive. The transport entitycarries outthis primitiveby blocking the caller and sending a packet to the server. Encapsulated in the pay- loadofthispacket isatransport layer message fortheserver’s transport entity. A quick note on terminology is now in order. For lack of a better term, we will use the term segment for messages sent from transport entity to transport en- tity. TCP, UDP and other Internet protocols use this term. Some older protocols used the ungainly name TPDU (Transport Protocol Data Unit). That term is notusedmuchanymore nowbutyoumaysee itinolder papers andbooks. Thus, segments (exchanged by the transport layer) are contained in packets (exchanged by the network layer). In turn, these packets are contained in frames (exchanged by the data link layer). When a frame arrives, the data link layer processes the frame header and, if the destination address matches for local deliv- ery, passes the contents of the frame payload field up to the network entity. The network entity similarly processes the packet header and then passes the contents of the packet payload up to the transport entity. This nesting is illustrated in Fig.6-3. Frame Packet Segment header header header Segmentpayload Packetpayload Framepayload Figure6-3. Nestingofsegments,packets,andframes. Getting back to our client-server example, the client’s CONNECT call causes a CONNECTION REQUEST segment to be sent to the server. When it arrives, the 500 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 transport entity checks to see that the server is blocked on a LISTEN (i.e., is inter- ested in handling requests). If so, it then unblocks the server and sends a CON- NECTION ACCEPTED segment back to the client. When this segment arrives, the client isunblockedandtheconnectionisestablished. Data can now be exchanged using the SEND and RECEIVE primitives. In the simplest form, either party can doa (blocking)RECEIVE towait for the other party to do a SEND. When the segment arrives, the receiver is unblocked. It can then process the segment and send a reply. As long as both sides can keep track of whose turnitistosend,thisscheme worksfine. Note that in the transport layer, even a simple unidirectional data exchange is more complicated than at the network layer. Every data packet sent will also be acknowledged (eventually). The packets bearing control segments are also acknowledged, implicitly or explicitly. These acknowledgements are managed by the transport entities, using the network layer protocol, and are not visible to the transport users. Similarly, the transport entities need to worry about timers and retransmissions. None of this machinery is visible to the transport users. To the transport users, a connection is a reliable bit pipe: one user stuffs bits in and they magically appear in the same order at the other end', 'This ability to hide com- plexity isthereason thatlayered protocols are suchapowerful tool. When a connection is no longer needed, it must be released to free up table space within the twotransport entities. Disconnectionhas twovariants: asymmet- ric and symmetric. In the asymmetric variant, either transport user can issue a DISCONNECTprimitive,which results inaDISCONNECTsegment beingsenttothe remote transport entity. Uponitsarrival, theconnectionisreleased. In the symmetric variant, each direction is closed separately, independently of the other one. When one side does aDISCONNECT, that means it has nomore data to send but it is still willing to accept data from its partner. In this model, a con- nection isreleased whenbothsideshave doneaDISCONNECT. A state diagram for connection establishment and release for these simple primitivesisgiven inFig. 6-4. Each transition istriggered bysome event, either a primitive executed by the local transport user or an incoming packet. For simpli- city, we assume here that each segment is separately acknowledged. We also as- sume that a symmetric disconnection model is used, with the client going first. Please note that this model is quite unsophisticated. We will look at more realis- ticmodels later onwhenwedescribe howTCP works. 6.1.3 Berkeley Sockets Let usnowbriefly inspect another set of transport primitives, the socket prim- itives as they are used for TCP. Sockets were first released as part of the Berke- ley UNIX 4.2BSD software distribution in 1983. They quickly became popular. The primitives are now widely used for Internet programming on many operating SEC. 6.1 THETRANSPORT SERVICE 501 Connectionrequest Connectprimitive segmentreceived executed IDLE PASSIVE ACTIVE ESTABLISHMENT ESTABLISHMENT PENDING PENDING Connectprimitive Connectionaccepted executed segmentreceived ESTABLISHED Disconnection Disconnect requestsegment primitive PASSIVE ACTIVE received executed DISCONNECT DISCONNECT PENDING PENDING IDLE Disconnect Disconnectionrequest primitiveexecuted segmentreceived Figure6-4.

Roughly speaking, they follow the mo- del of our first example but offer more features and flexibility. We will not look atthecorrespondingsegments here. That discussion willcome later.

ThesocketprimitivesforTCP. 502 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 The first four primitives in the list are executed in that order by servers. The SOCKET primitive creates a new endpoint and allocates table space for it within the transport entity. The parameters of the call specify the addressing format to be used, the type of service desired (e.g., reliable byte stream), and the protocol. A successfulSOCKET call returns an ordinary file descriptor for use in succeeding calls, thesame wayanOPEN call onafile does. Newly created sockets do not have network addresses. These are assigned using theBIND primitive. Once a server has bound an address to a socket, remote clients can connect to it. The reason for not having theSOCKET call create an ad- dress directly is that some processes care about their addresses (e.g., they have been using the same address for years and everyone knows this address), whereas othersdonot', 'Nextcomes theLISTEN call, which allocates spacetoqueue incoming calls for the case that several clients try to connect at the same time. In contrast toLISTEN inourfirst example, inthesocket modelLISTEN isnotablockingcall. To block waiting for an incoming connection, the server executes an ACCEPT primitive. When a segment asking for a connection arrives, the transport entity creates anew socket withthe same properties as the original one andreturns a file descriptor for it. The server can then fork off a process or thread to handle the connection on the new socket and go back to waiting for the next connection on the original socket. ACCEPT returns a file descriptor, which can be used for read- ingandwritinginthestandard way, thesame asforfiles. Now let us look at the client side. Here, too, a socket must first be created using the SOCKET primitive, but BIND is not required since the address used does not matter to the server. The CONNECT primitive blocks the caller and actively starts the connection process. When it completes (i.e., when the appropriate seg- ment is received from the server), the client process is unblocked and the con- nection is established. Both sides can now useSEND andRECEIVE to transmit and receivedata overthefull-duplexconnection. The standardUNIXREAD andWRITE system calls can also be used if none of the special options ofSEND andRECEIVE are required. Connection release with sockets is symmetric. When both sides have exe- cuted aCLOSE primitive,theconnectionisreleased. Sockets have proved tremendously popular and are the de facto standard for abstracting transport services to applications. The socket API is often used with the TCP protocol to provide a connection-oriented service called a reliable byte stream, which is simply the reliable bit pipe that we described. However, other protocols could be used to implement this service using the same API. It should allbethesame tothetransport service users. A strength of the socket API is that is can be used by an application for other transport services. For instance, sockets can be used with a connectionless tran- sport service. In this case, CONNECT sets the address of the remote transport peer and SEND and RECEIVE send and receive datagrams to and from the remote peer. SEC. 6.1 THETRANSPORT SERVICE 503 (It is also common to use an expanded set of calls, for example, SENDTO and RECEIVEFROM, that emphasize messages and do not limit an application to a sin- gle transport peer.) Sockets can also be used with transport protocols that provide a message stream rather than a byte stream and that do or do not have congestion control. For example, DCCP (Datagram Congestion Controlled Protocol) is a version of UDP with congestion control (Kohler et al., 2006). It is up to the tran- sportusers tounderstandwhatservice theyare getting. However, sockets are not likely to be the final word on transport interfaces. For example, applications often work with a group of related streams, such as a Web browser that requests several objects fromthe same server. With sockets, the most natural fit is for application programs to use one stream per object', 'This structure means that congestion control is applied separately for each stream, not across the group, which is suboptimal. It punts to the application the burden of managing the set. Newer protocols and interfaces have been devised that support groups of related streams more effectively and simply for the application. Two examples are SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) defined in RFC 4960 and SST (Structured Stream Transport) (Ford, 2007). These protocols must change the socket API slightly to get the benefits of groups of related streams, and they also support features such as a mix of connection-oriented and connectionless traffic and even multiple network paths. Time will tell if they are successful. 6.1.4 An Example of Socket Programming: An Internet File Server As an example of the nitty-gritty of how real socket calls are made, consider the client and server code of Fig.6-6. Here we have a very primitive Internet file server along with an example client that uses it. The code has many limitations (discussed below), but in principle the server code can be compiled and run on anyUNIX system connected to the Internet. The client code can be compiled and run on any other UNIX machine on the Internet, anywhere in the world. The cli- ent code can be executed with appropriate parameters to fetch any file to which the server has accessonits machine. The file iswrittentostandard output,which, ofcourse, canberedirected toafile orpipe. Let us look at the server code first. It starts out by including some standard headers, the last three of which contain the main Internet-related definitions and data structures. Next comes a definition of SERVER PORT as 12345. This num- ber was chosen arbitrarily. Any number between 1024 and 65535 will work just as well, as long as it is not in use by some other process; ports below 1023 are re- served forprivileged users. The next two lines in the server define two constants needed. The first one determines the chunk size in bytes used for the file transfer. The second one de- termines how many pending connections can be held before additional ones are discarded uponarrival. 504 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 /*Thispagecontainsaclientprogramthatcanrequestafilefromtheserverprogram *onthenextpage.Theserverrespondsbysendingthewholefile. */ #include<sys/types.h> #include<sys/socket.h> #include<netinet/in.h> #include<netdb.h> #defineSERVER PORT12345 /*arbitrary,butclient&servermustagree*/ #defineBUF SIZE4096 /*blocktransfersize*/ intmain(intargc,char**argv) { intc,s,bytes; charbuf[BUF SIZE]; /*bufferforincomingfile*/ structhostent*h; /*infoaboutserver*/ structsockaddr inchannel; /*holdsIPaddress*/ if(argc!=3)fatal(\"Usage:clientserver-namefile-name\"); h=gethostbyname(argv[1]); /*lookuphost’sIPaddress*/ if(!h)fatal(\"gethostbynamefailed\"); s=socket(PF INET,SOCK STREAM,IPPROTO TCP); if(s<0)fatal(\"socket\"); memset(&channel,0,sizeof(channel)); channel.sin family=AF INET; memcpy(&channel.sin addr.s addr,h->h addr,h->h length); channel.sin port=htons(SERVER PORT); c=connect(s,(structsockaddr*)&channel,sizeof(channel)); if(c<0)fatal(\"connectfailed\"); /*Connectionisnowestablished.Sendfilenameincluding0byteatend.*/ write(s,argv[2],strlen(argv[2])+1); /*Gogetthefileandwriteittostandardoutput.*/ while(1){ bytes=read(s,buf,BUF SIZE); /*readfromsocket*/ if(bytes<=0)exit(0); /*checkforendoffile*/ write(1,buf,bytes); /*writetostandardoutput*/ } } fatal(char*string) { printf(\"%s\\\\n\",string); exit(1); } Figure6-6.

It starts out by initializing a data structure that will hold the server’s IP address. This data structure will soon be bound to the server’s socket. The call to memset sets the data structure to all 0s. The three assignments following it fill in three of its fields. The last of these contains the server’s port. The functions htonl and htons have to do with converting values to a standard format so the code runs correctly on both little-endian machines (e.g., Intel x86) and big-endian machines (e.g., the SPARC). Their exact semantics are notrelevant here. Next, theserver creates asocket andchecks forerrors (indicated bys <0). In aproductionversionofthecode, theerror message couldbeatrifle moreexplana- tory. The call to setsockopt is needed to allow the port to be reused so the server can runindefinitely, fielding request after request. NowtheIPaddress isboundto the socket and a check is made to see if the call to bind succeeded. The final step in the initialization is the call to listen to announce the server’s willingness to ac- cept incoming calls and tell the system to hold up to QUEUE SIZE of them in case new requests arrive while the server is still processing the current one. If the queue isfullandadditionalrequests arrive, theyare quietly discarded. At this point, the server enters its main loop, which it never leaves. The only way to stop it is to kill it from outside. The call to accept blocks the server until some client tries to establish a connection with it. If the accept call succeeds, it returns a socket descriptor that can be used for reading and writing, analogous to howfile descriptors can be used toread from and write to pipes. However, unlike pipes, which are unidirectional, sockets are bidirectional, so sa (the accepted socket) can be used for reading from the connection and also for writing to it. A pipefile descriptor isforreading orwritingbutnotboth. After the connection is established, the server reads the file name from it. If the name is not yet available, the server blocks waiting for it. After getting the file name, the server opens the file and enters a loop that alternately reads blocks from the file and writes them to the socket until the entire file has been copied. Then the server closes the file and the connection and waits for the next con- nection toshowup. Itrepeats thisloopforever. Now let us look at the client code. To understand how it works, it is neces- sarytounderstandhowitisinvoked. Assumingitiscalled client,atypical call is client flits.cs.vu.nl /usr/tom/filename>f This call only works if the server is already running on flits.cs.vu.nl and the file /usr/tom/filename exists and the server has read access to it. If the call is suc- cessful, the file istransferred over the Internet andwrittentof,after which the cli- ent program exits. Since the server continues after a transfer, the client can be started again andagain togetother files. The client code starts with some includes and declarations', 'Execution begins by checking to see if it has been called with the right number of arguments (argc =3means the program name plustwoarguments). Note that argv[1]contains the SEC. 6.1 THETRANSPORT SERVICE 507 name of the server (e.g., flits.cs.vu.nl) and is converted to an IP address by gethostbyname.This function uses DNS to look up the name.We willstudy DNS inChap.7. Next, a socket is created and initialized. After that, the client attempts to es- tablish a TCP connection to the server, using connect. If the server is upand run- ning on the named machine and attached to SERVER PORT and is either idle or has room in its listen queue, the connection will (eventually) be established. Using the connection, the client sends the name of the file by writing on the socket. The number of bytes sent is one larger than the name proper, since the 0 byte terminating the name must also be sent to tell the server where the name ends. Now the client enters a loop, reading the file block by block from the socket andcopyingittostandard output. Whenitisdone,itjustexits. The procedure fatal prints an error message and exits. The server needs the same procedure, but it was omitted due to lack of space on the page. Since the client and server are compiled separately and normally run on different com- puters, theycannotshare thecode offatal. These two programs (as well as other material related to this book) can be fetched fromthebook’sWebsite http://www.pearsonhighered.com/tanenbaum Just for the record, this server is not the last word in serverdom. Its error checking is meager and its error reporting is mediocre. Since it handles all re- quests strictly sequentially (becauseit has only a single thread), its performance is poor. It has clearly never heard about security, and using bare UNIX system calls is not the way to gain platform independence. It also makes some assumptions that are technically illegal, such as assuming that the file name fits in the buffer and is transmitted atomically. These shortcomings notwithstanding, it is a work- ing Internet file server. In the exercises, the reader is invited to improve it. For more information about programming with sockets, see Donahoo and Calvert (2008,2009). 6.2 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS The transport service is implemented by a transport protocol used between the two transport entities. In some ways, transport protocols resemble the data link protocols we studied in detail in Chap. 3. Both have to deal with error con- trol,sequencing, andflowcontrol, amongotherissues. However, significant differences between the two also exist. These dif- ferences are due to major dissimilarities between the environments in which the two protocols operate, as shown in Fig. 6-7. At the data link layer, two routers 508 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 communicate directly via a physical channel, whether wired or wireless, whereas atthetransport layer, thisphysicalchannel isreplacedbytheentire network. This difference hasmanyimportant implications fortheprotocols. Router Router Network Physical communicationchannel Host (a) (b) Figure6-7. (a)Environmentofthedatalinklayer. (b)Environmentofthe transportlayer', 'For one thing, over point-to-point links such as wires or optical fiber, it is usually not necessary for a router tospecify which router itwants totalk to—each outgoing line leads directly to a particular router. In the transport layer, explicit addressing ofdestinations isrequired. For another thing, the process of establishing a connection over the wire of Fig.6-7(a) is simple: the other end is always there (unless it has crashed, inwhich case it is not there). Either way, there is not much to do. Even on wireless links, the process is not much different. Just sending a message is sufficient to have it reach all other destinations. If the message is not acknowledged due to an error, it can beresent. Inthetransport layer, initialconnectionestablishment iscomplicat- ed,aswewillsee. Another (exceedingly annoying) difference between the data link layer and the transport layer is the potential existence of storage capacity in the network. When a router sends a packet over a link, it may arrive or be lost, but it cannot bouncearoundforawhile, gointo hidingina far corner oftheworld,andsudden- ly emerge after other packets that were sent much later. If the network uses data- grams, which are independently routed inside, there is a nonnegligible probability that a packet may take the scenic route and arrive late and out of the expected order, or even that duplicates of the packet will arrive. The consequences of the network’s ability to delay and duplicate packets can sometimes be disastrous and can require theuseofspecial protocols tocorrectly transport information. A final difference between the data link and transport layers is one of degree rather than of kind. Buffering and flow control are needed in both layers, but the presence in the transport layer of a large and varying number of connections with bandwidth that fluctuates as the connections compete with each other may require a different approach than we used in the data link layer. Some of the protocols discussed in Chap. 3 allocate a fixed number of buffers to each line, so that when aframe arrives abufferisalways available. Inthetransport layer, the larger num- ber of connections that must be managed and variations in the bandwidth each SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 509 connectionmayreceive make the idea ofdedicating many buffers toeach oneless attractive. In the following sections, we will examine all of these important is- sues,andothers. 6.2.1 Addressing When an application (e.g., a user) process wishes to set up a connection to a remote application process, it must specify which one to connect to. (Con- nectionless transport has the same problem: to whom should each message be sent?) The method normally used is to define transport addresses to which proc- esses can listen forconnectionrequests. Inthe Internet, these endpointsare called ports. We will use the generic term TSAP (Transport Service Access Point) to mean a specific endpoint in the transport layer. The analogous endpoints in the network layer (i.e., network layer addresses) are not-surprisingly called NSAPs (Network Service AccessPoints). IPaddresses are examples ofNSAPs. Figure 6-8 illustrates the relationship between the NSAPs, the TSAPs, and a transport connection', 'Application processes, both clients and servers, can attach themselves to a local TSAP to establish a connection to a remote TSAP. These connections run through NSAPs on each host, as shown. The purpose of having TSAPs is that in some networks, each computer has a single NSAP, so some way isneeded todistinguishmultipletransport endpointsthatshare thatNSAP.

A mail server process attaches itself to TSAP 1522 on host 2 to wait for an incoming call. Howa process attaches itself toaTSAP isout- side the networking model and depends entirely on the local operat- ingsystem. Acall suchasourLISTEN mightbeused,forexample. 2. An application process on host 1 wants to send an email message, so it attaches itself to TSAP 1208 and issues a CONNECTrequest. The request specifies TSAP 1208 on host 1 as the source and TSAP 1522 on host 2 as the destination. This action ultimately results in a tran- sport connection being established between the application process andtheserver. 3. The application process sendsoverthemail message. 4. The mailserver respondstosaythatitwilldeliver themessage. 5. The transport connectionisreleased. Note that there may well be other servers on host 2 that are attached to other TSAPs andare waitingforincoming connectionsthatarrive overthesame NSAP. The picture painted above is fine, except we have swept one little problem under the rug: how does the user process onhost1knowthat the mail server isat- tached to TSAP 1522? One possibility is that the mail server has been attaching itself to TSAP 1522 for years and gradually all the network users have learned this. In this model, services have stable TSAP addresses that are listed in files in well-known places. For example, the /etc/services file on UNIX systems lists which servers are permanently attached to which ports, including the fact that the mail server isfoundonTCP port25. While stable TSAP addresses work for a small number of key services that never change (e.g., the Web server), user processes, in general, often want to talk to other user processes that do not have TSAP addresses that are known in ad- vance, orthatmayexist foronlyashorttime. To handle this situation, an alternative scheme can be used. In this scheme, there exists a special process called a portmapper. To find the TSAP address correspondingtoagivenservice name, suchas‘‘BitTorrent,’’ausersetsupacon- nection to the portmapper (which listens to a well-known TSAP). The user then sends a message specifying the service name, and the portmapper sends back the TSAP address.Then the user releases the connection with the portmapper and es- tablishes anewonewiththedesired service. In this model, when a new service is created, it must register itself with the portmapper, giving both its service name (typically, an ASCII string) and its TSAP. The portmapper records this information in its internal database so that whenqueries come inlater, itwillknowtheanswers. SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 511 The function of the portmapper is analogous to that of a directory assistance operator in the telephone system—it provides a mapping of names onto numbers', 'Just as in the telephone system, it is essential that the address of the well-known TSAP used by the portmapper is indeed well known. If you do not know the number of the information operator, you cannot call the information operator to find it out. If you think the number you dial for information is obvious, try it in a foreign countrysometime. Many of the server processes that can exist on a machine will be used only rarely. It is wasteful to have each of them active and listening to a stable TSAP address all day long. An alternative scheme is shown in Fig.6-9 in a simplified form. It is known as the initial connection protocol. Instead of every conceiv- able server listening at a well-known TSAP, each machine that wishes to offer services to remote users has a special process server that acts as a proxy for less heavily used servers. This server is called inetd on UNIX systems. It listens to a set ofportsatthesame time, waitingforaconnectionrequest. Potential usersofa service begin by doing a CONNECTrequest, specifying the TSAP address of the service they want. If no server is waiting for them, they get a connection to the process server, asshowninFig.6-9(a).

After it gets the incoming request, the process server spawns the requested server, allowing ittoinherit theexisting connectionwiththeuser. Thenewserver 512 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 does the requested work, while the process server goes back to listening for new requests, as shown in Fig.6-9(b). This method is only applicable when servers can becreated ondemand. 6.2.2 Connection Establishment Establishing a connection sounds easy, but it is actually surprisingly tricky. At first glance, it would seem sufficient for one transport entity to just send a CONNECTIONREQUEST segment tothe destination and wait for aCONNECTION ACCEPTED reply. The problem occurs when the network can lose, delay, corrupt, andduplicatepackets. Thisbehavior causes serious complications. Imagine a network that is so congested that acknowledgements hardly ever get back intime andeachpacket times outand isretransmittedtwoorthree times. Suppose that the network uses datagrams inside and that every packet follows a different route. Some of the packets might get stuck in a traffic jam inside the network and take a long time to arrive. That is, they may be delayed in the net- workandpopoutmuchlater, whenthesender thoughtthattheyhadbeenlost. The worst possible nightmare is as follows. A user establishes a connection with a bank, sends messages telling the bank to transfer a large amount of money totheaccountofanot-entirely-trustworthy person. Unfortunately, the packets de- cide to take the scenic route to the destination and go off exploring a remote corner of the network. The sender then times out and sends them all again. This time the packets take the shortest route and are delivered quickly sothe sender re- leases theconnection', 'Unfortunately, eventually the initial batch of packets finally come out of hid- ing and arrive at the destination in order, asking the bank to establish a new con- nection and transfer money (again). The bank has no way of telling that these are duplicates. It must assume that this is a second, independent transaction, and transfers themoneyagain. This scenario may sound unlikely, or even implausible but the point is this: protocols mustbedesigned tobecorrect inallcases. Onlythecommoncases need be implemented efficiently to obtain good network performance, but the protocol must be able to cope with the uncommon cases without breaking. If it cannot, we have built a fair-weather network that can fail without warning when the condi- tionsgettough. For the remainder of this section, we will study the problem of delayed dupli- cates, with emphasis on algorithms for establishing connections in a reliable way, so that nightmares like the one above cannot happen. The crux of the problem is that the delayed duplicates are thought to be new packets. We cannot prevent packets from being duplicated and delayed. But if and when this happens, the packets mustberejected asduplicatesandnotprocessed asfresh packets. The problem can be attacked in various ways, none of them very satisfactory. One way is to use throwaway transport addresses. In this approach, each time a SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 513 transport address is needed, a new one is generated. When a connection is re- leased, the address is discarded and never used again. Delayed duplicate packets then never find their way to a transport process and can do no damage. However, thisapproach makes itmore difficult toconnectwithaprocess inthefirstplace. Another possibility is to give each connection a unique identifier (i.e., a se- quence number incremented for each connection established) chosen by the ini- tiating party andputineach segment, including the one requesting the connection. After each connection is released, each transport entity can update a table listing obsolete connections as (peer transport entity, connection identifier) pairs. When- ever a connection request comes in, it can be checked against the table to see if it belongstoapreviously released connection. Unfortunately, thisscheme has abasic flaw:it requires each transport entityto maintain a certain amount of history information indefinitely. This history must persist at both the source and destination machines. Otherwise, if a machine crashes and loses its memory, it will no longer know which connection identifiers have already been usedbyitspeers. Instead, we need to take a different tack to simplify the problem. Rather than allowing packets to live forever within the network, we devise a mechanism to kill off aged packets that are still hobbling about. With this restriction, the prob- lembecomes somewhat more manageable. Packet lifetime can be restricted to a known maximum using one (or more) of thefollowing techniques: 1. Restricted network design. 2. Puttingahopcounterineachpacket. 3. Timestamping eachpacket. The first technique includes any method that prevents packets from looping, com- bined with some way of bounding delay including congestion over the (now known) longest possible path. It is difficult, given that internets may range from a single city to international in scope', 'The second method consists of having the hop count initialized to some appropriate value and decremented each time the packet is forwarded. The network protocol simply discards anypacket whose hop counter becomes zero. The third method requires each packet to bear the time it was created, with the routers agreeing to discard any packet older than some agreed-upon time. This latter method requires the router clocks to be synchron- ized, which itself is a nontrivial task, and in practice a hop counter is a close enoughapproximation toage. In practice, we will need to guarantee not only that a packet is dead, but also that all acknowledgements to it are dead, too, so we will now introduce a period T, which is some small multiple of the true maximum packet lifetime. The maxi- mum packet lifetime isaconservative constant fora network; fortheInternet, itis somewhat arbitrarily taken tobe 120seconds. The multiple is protocol dependent 514 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 and simply has the effect of making T longer. If we wait a time T secs after a packet hasbeen sent, wecanbesurethatalltracesofitare nowgoneandthat nei- ther it nor its acknowledgements will suddenly appear out of the blue to compli- cate matters. With packet lifetimes bounded, it is possible to devise a practical and fool- proof way to reject delayed duplicate segments. The method described below is due to Tomlinson (1975), as refined by Sunshine and Dalal (1978). Variants of it are widely usedinpractice, including inTCP. The heart of the method is for the source to label segments with sequence numbers that willnotbereused withinTsecs. The period, T,andtherate ofpack- ets per second determine the size of the sequence numbers. In this way, only one packet with a given sequence number may be outstanding at any given time. Dup- licates of this packet may still occur, and they must be discarded by the destina- tion. However, it is no longer the case that a delayed duplicate of an old packet may beat a new packet with the same sequence number and be accepted by the destination initsstead. To get around the problem of a machine losing all memory of where it was after a crash, one possibility is to require transport entities to be idle for T secs after arecovery. Theidleperiod willletalloldsegments die off, sothe sender can start again with any sequence number. However, in a complex internetwork, T maybelarge, sothisstrategy isunattractive. Instead, Tomlinson proposed equipping each host with a time-of-day clock. The clocks at different hosts need not be synchronized. Each clock is assumed to take the form of a binary counter that increments itself at uniform intervals. Fur- thermore, the number of bits in the counter must equal or exceed the number of bits in the sequence numbers. Last, and most important, the clock is assumed to continue runningevenifthehostgoesdown. When a connection is set up, the low-order k bits of the clock are used as the k-bit initial sequence number. Thus, unlike our protocols of Chap. 3, each con- nection starts numbering its segments with a different initial sequence number', 'The sequence space should be so large that by the time sequence numbers wrap around, old segments with the same sequence number are long gone. This linear relation between time and initial sequence numbers is shown in Fig. 6-10(a). The forbidden region shows the times for which segment sequence numbers are illegal leading up to their use. If any segment is sent with a sequence number in this re- gion, it could be delayed and impersonate a different packet with the same se- quence number that will be issued slightly later. For example, if the host crashes and restarts at time 70 seconds, it will use initial sequence numbers based on the clock to pick up after it left off; the host does not start with a lower sequence number intheforbidden region. Once both transport entities have agreed on the initial sequence number, any sliding window protocol can be used for data flow control. This window protocol will correctly find and discard duplicates of packets after they have already been SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 515 120 80 70 60 0 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 Time Time (a) (b) srebmunecneuqeS srebmunecneuqeS 2k–1 T T n e d d or bi o n F gi e r Restartafter crashwith70 Actualsequence numbersused Figure6-10.

In reality, the initial sequence number curve (shown by the heavy line) is not linear, but a staircase, since the clock advances in discrete steps. For sim- plicity, wewillignorethisdetail. To keep packet sequence numbers out of the forbidden region, we need to take care in two respects. We can get into trouble in two distinct ways. If a host sends too much data too fast on a newly opened connection, the actual sequence number versus time curve may rise more steeply than the initial sequence number versus time curve, causing the sequence number to enter the forbidden region. To prevent this from happening, the maximum data rate on any connection is one segment per clock tick. This also means that the transport entity must wait until the clock ticks before opening a new connectionafter a crash restart, lest the same number be used twice. Both of these points argue in favor of a short clock tick (1 μsec or less). But the clock cannot tick too fast relative to the sequence number. For a clock rate of C and a sequence number space of size S, we must have S/C>Tsothatthesequence numberscannotwrap aroundtooquickly. Entering the forbidden region from underneath by sending too fast is not the only way to get into trouble. From Fig.6-10(b), we see that at any data rate less than the clock rate, the curve of actual sequence numbers used versus time will eventually run into the forbidden region from the left as the sequence numbers wrap around. The greater the slope of the actual sequence numbers, the longer this event will be delayed. Avoiding this situation limits how slowly sequence numberscan advance onaconnection(orhowlongtheconnectionsmaylast)', 'The clock-based method solves the problem of not being able to distinguish delayed duplicate segments from new segments. However, there is a practical snagforusingitforestablishing connections.Since we donotnormally remember sequence numbers across connections at the destination, we still have no way of 516 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 knowing if a CONNECTION REQUEST segment containing an initial sequence number is a duplicate of a recent connection. This snag does not exist during a connection because the sliding window protocol does remember the current se- quence number. To solve this specific problem, Tomlinson (1975) introduced the three-way handshake. This establishment protocol involves one peer checking with the other that the connection request is indeed current. The normal setup procedure when host1initiatesisshowninFig. 6-11(a). Host1choosesasequence number, x, and sends a CONNECTION REQUEST segment containing it to host 2. Host 2 replies with an ACK segment acknowledging x and announcing its own initial se- quence number, y. Finally, host 1 acknowledges host 2’s choice of an initial se- quence numberinthefirstdata segment thatitsends. Nowletussee howthethree-way handshake worksinthepresence ofdelayed duplicate control segments. In Fig.6-11(b), the first segment is a delayed dupli- cate CONNECTION REQUEST from an old connection. This segment arrives at host 2 without host 1’s knowledge. Host 2 reacts to this segment by sending host 1 an ACK segment, in effect asking for verification that host 1 was indeed trying to set up a new connection. When host 1 rejects host 2’s attempt to establish a connection,host2realizes that it was tricked bya delayed duplicateandabandons theconnection. Inthisway,adelayed duplicatedoesnodamage. The worst case is when both a delayed CONNECTION REQUEST and an ACK are floating around in the subnet. This case is shown in Fig. 6-11(c). As in the previous example, host 2 gets a delayed CONNECTION REQUEST and replies to it. At this point, it is crucial to realize that host 2 has proposed using y as the ini- tial sequence number for host 2 to host 1 traffic, knowing full well that no seg- ments containing sequence number y or acknowledgements to y are still in exist- ence. When the second delayed segment arrives at host 2, the fact that z has been acknowledged rather than y tells host 2 that this, too, is an old duplicate. The im- portant thing to realize here is that there is no combination of old segments that can cause the protocol to fail and have a connection set up by accident when no onewants it. TCP uses this three-way handshake to establish connections. Within a con- nection, a timestamp is used to extend the 32-bit sequence number so that it will not wrap within the maximum packet lifetime, even for gigabit-per-second con- nections. This mechanism isa fixtoTCP that was needed as it was usedonfaster and faster links. It is described in RFC 1323 and called PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers). Across connections, for the initial se- quence numbers and before PAWS can come into play, TCP originally used the clock-based scheme just described. However, this turned out to have a security vulnerability', 'The clock made it easy for an attacker to predict the next initial se- quence number and send packets that tricked the three-way handshake and estab- lished a forged connection. To close this hole, pseudorandom initial sequence numbers are used for connections in practice. However, it remains important that SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 517 emiT emiT emiT Host1 Host2 Host1 Host2 Oldduplicate CR(seq=x) CR(seq=x) ACK (seq = y, ACK = x) ACK (seq = y, ACK = x) DATA(seq=x,ACK=y) REJECT(ACK=y) (a) (b) Host1 Host2 CR(seq=x) Oldduplicate A C K = x) A C K (s e q = y, DA A T C A K (s = e z q ) =x, Oldduplicate REJECT(ACK=y) (c) Figure6-11.

Otherwise, delayed duplicatescan wreak havoc. 6.2.3 Connection Release Releasing aconnectioniseasier thanestablishing one. Nevertheless, there are more pitfalls than one might expect here. As we mentioned earlier, there are two styles of terminating a connection: asymmetric release and symmetric release. 518 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 Asymmetric release is the way the telephonesystem works: when oneparty hangs up, the connection is broken. Symmetric release treats the connection as two sep- arate unidirectional connectionsandrequires eachonetobereleased separately. Asymmetric release is abrupt and may result in data loss. Consider the scen- ario of Fig.6-12. After the connection is established, host 1 sends a segment that arrives properly at host 2. Then host 1 sends another segment. Unfortunately, host 2 issues aDISCONNECT before the second segment arrives. The result is that theconnectionisreleased anddata are lost. emiT Host1 Host2 CR ACK DATA DATA DR Nodataare deliveredafter adisconnect request Figure6-12. Abruptdisconnectionwithlossofdata. Clearly, a more sophisticated release protocol is needed to avoid data loss. One way is to use symmetric release, in which each direction is released indepen- dently of the other one. Here, a host can continue to receive data even after it has sentaDISCONNECTsegment. Symmetric release does the job when each process has a fixed amount of data to send and clearly knowswhen it has sent it. Inother situations, determining that all the work has been done and the connection should be terminated is not so ob- vious. One can envision a protocol in which host 1 says ‘‘I am done. Are you done too?’’ If host 2 responds: ‘‘I am done too. Goodbye, the connection can be safely released.’’ Unfortunately, this protocol does not always work. There is a famous prob- lem that illustrates this issue. It is called the two-army problem. Imagine that a white army is encamped in a valley, as shown in Fig. 6-13. On both of the sur- rounding hillsides are blue armies. The white army is larger than either of the blue armies alone, but together the blue armies are larger than the white army. If either blue army attacks byitself, it willbe defeated, butifthe twoblue armies at- tack simultaneously, theywillbevictorious', 'The blue armies want to synchronize their attacks. However, their only com- munication medium is to send messengers on foot down into the valley, where SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 519 Blue Blue B army B army #1 #2 Whitearmy W Figure6-13. Thetwo-armyproblem. they might be captured and the message lost (i.e., they have to use an unreliable communication channel). The question is: does a protocol exist that allows the bluearmies towin? Suppose that the commander of blue army #1 sends a message reading: ‘‘I propose we attack at dawn on March 29. How about it?’’ Now suppose that the message arrives, the commander of blue army #2 agrees, and his reply gets safely back toblue army #1. Willthe attack happen? Probably not,becausecommander #2 does not know if his reply got through. If it did not, blue army #1 will not at- tack, soitwouldbefoolishforhimtocharge intobattle. Now let us improve the protocol by making it a three-way handshake. The initiator of the original proposal must acknowledge the response. Assuming no messages are lost, blue army #2 will get the acknowledgement, but the com- mander of blue army #1 will now hesitate. After all, he does not know if his ac- knowledgementgot through,and if it did not, he knows that blue army #2will not attack. We could now make a four-way handshake protocol, but that does not helpeither. Infact, itcan beproven that noprotocol exists that works. Supposethat some protocol did exist. Either the last message of the protocol is essential, or it is not. Ifitisnot,wecan remove it (and anyother unessential messages) untilwe are left with a protocol in which every message is essential. What happens if the final message does not get through? We just said that it was essential, so if it is lost, the attack does not take place. Since the sender of the final message can never be sure of its arrival, he will not risk attacking. Worse yet, the other blue army knowsthis,soitwillnotattack either. Tosee the relevance of the two-army problem toreleasing connections, rather than tomilitary affairs, just substitute ‘‘disconnect’’for ‘‘attack.’’Ifneither side is 520 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 prepared to disconnect until it is convinced that the other side is prepared to disconnecttoo,thedisconnectionwillnever happen. In practice, we can avoid this quandary by foregoing the need for agreement and pushing the problem up to the transport user, letting each side independently decide when it is done. This is an easier problem to solve. Figure 6-14 illustrates four scenarios of releasing using a three-way handshake. While this protocol is notinfallible,itisusually adequate. In Fig.6-14(a), we see the normal case in which one of the users sends a DR (DISCONNECTION REQUEST) segment to initiate the connection release. When it arrives, the recipient sends back aDR segment and starts a timer, just in case its DR is lost. When thisDR arrives, the original sender sends back anACK segment and releases the connection. Finally, when the ACK segment arrives, the receiver also releases the connection', 'Releasing a connection means that the transport en- tity removes the information about the connection from its table of currently open connections and signals the connection’s owner (the transport user) somehow. Thisaction isdifferent fromatransport userissuingaDISCONNECTprimitive. If the final ACK segment is lost, as shown in Fig.6-14(b), the situation is saved bythetimer. When thetimer expires, theconnectionisreleased anyway. Now consider the case of the second DR being lost. The user initiating the disconnection will not receive the expected response, will time out, and will start all over again. In Fig.6-14(c), we see how this works, assuming that the second time nosegments are lostandallsegments are delivered correctly andontime. Our last scenario, Fig.6-14(d), is the same as Fig.6-14(c) except that now we assume all the repeated attempts to retransmit the DR also fail due to lost seg- ments. After N retries, the sender just gives up and releases the connection. Meanwhile, thereceivertimes outandalso exits. While this protocol usually suffices, in theory it can fail if the initial DR and N retransmissions are all lost. The sender willgive upandrelease the connection, while the other side knows nothing at all about the attempts to disconnect and is stillfullyactive. Thissituation results inahalf-open connection. We could have avoided this problem by not allowing the sender to give up after N retries and forcing it to go on forever until it gets a response. However, if theother side isallowed totime out,the sender willindeed goonforever, because no response will ever be forthcoming. If we do not allow the receiving side to time out,theprotocol hangsinFig. 6-14(d). One way to kill off half-open connections is to have a rule saying that if no segments have arrived foracertain number ofseconds,the connectionisautomat- ically disconnected. That way, if one side ever disconnects, the other side will detect the lack of activity and also disconnect. This rule also takes care of the case where the connection is broken (because the network can no longer deliver packets between the hosts) without either end disconnecting first. Of course, if this rule is introduced, it is necessary for each transport entity to have a timer that is stopped and then restarted whenever a segment is sent. If this timer expires, a SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 521 Host1 Host2 Host1 Host2 SendDR DR SendDR DR +starttimer +starttimer SendDR SendDR DR +starttimer DR +starttimer Release Release connection connection SendACK ACK Release SendACK ACK connection Lost (Timeout) release connection (a) (b) Host1 Host2 Host1 Host2 SendDR DR SendDR DR +starttimer +starttimer SendDR& SendDR& DR starttimer starttimer Lost Lost (Timeout) sendDR DR (Timeout) SendDR& +starttimer sendDR starttimer Lost DR +starttimer Release connection SendACK ACK (NTimeouts) (Timeout) Release release release connection connection connection (c) (d) Figure6-14.

On the other hand, if the automatic disconnect rule is used and toomany dummy seg- ments in a row are lost on an otherwise idle connection, first one side, then the other willautomatically disconnect', 'We will not belabor this point any more, but by now it should be clear that releasing a connection without data loss is not nearly as simple as it first appears. The lesson here is that the transport user must be involved in deciding when to 522 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 disconnect—the problem cannot be cleanly solved by the transport entities them- selves. To see the importance of the application, consider that while TCP nor- mally does a symmetric close (with each side independently closing its half of the connection with a FIN packet when it has sent its data), many Web servers send the client a RST packet that causes an abrupt close of the connection that is more likeanasymmetric close. ThisworksonlybecausetheWeb server knowsthe pat- tern of data exchange. First it receives a request from the client, which is all the data the client will send, and then it sends a response to the client. When the Web server isfinished with itsresponse,allofthedata hasbeen sentineither direction. The server can send the client a warning and abruptly shut the connection. If the client gets this warning, it will release its connection state then and there. If the client doesnotgetthewarning, itwilleventually realize that the server isnolong- er talking to it and release the connection state. The data has been successfully transferred ineither case. 6.2.4 Error Control and Flow Control Having examined connection establishment and release in some detail, let us now look at how connections are managed while they are in use. The key issues are error control and flow control. Error control is ensuring that the data is deliv- ered with the desired level of reliability, usually that all of the data is delivered without any errors. Flow control is keeping a fast transmitter from overrunning a slowreceiver. Both of these issues have come up before, when we studied the data link layer. The solutions that are used at the transport layer are the same mechanisms thatwestudied inChap. 3.Asaverybrief recap: 1. A frame carries an error-detecting code (e.g., a CRC or checksum) thatisusedtocheck iftheinformation wascorrectly received. 2. A frame carries a sequence number to identify itself and is retrans- mitted by the sender until it receives an acknowledgement of suc- cessful receipt from the receiver. This is called ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest). 3. There is a maximum number of frames that the sender will allow to beoutstanding atanytime, pausingifthereceiverisnotacknowledg- ingframes quickly enough. Ifthismaximum isonepacket the proto- col is called stop-and-wait. Larger windows enable pipelining and improve performance onlong,fast links. 4. The sliding window protocol combines these features and is also usedtosupportbidirectional data transfer. Given that these mechanisms are used on frames at the link layer, it is natural to wonder why they would be used on segments at the transport layer as well. SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 523 However, there is little duplication between the link and transport layers in prac- tice. Even thoughthe same mechanisms are used, there are differences infunction anddegree. For a difference in function, consider error detection', 'The link layer check- sum protects a frame while it crosses a single link. The transport layer checksum protects a segment while it crosses an entire network path. It is an end-to-end check, which isnotthesame ashavingacheck onevery link. Saltzer etal.(1984) describe a situation in which packets were corrupted inside a router. The link layer checksums protected the packets only while they traveled across a link, not while they were inside the router. Thus, packets were delivered incorrectly even thoughtheywere correct accordingtothechecks onevery link. This and other examples led Saltzer et al. to articulate the end-to-end argu- ment. According to this argument, the transport layer check that runs end-to-end isessential forcorrectness, andthelink layer checks are notessential butnonethe- less valuable for improving performance (since without them a corrupted packet can besentalongtheentire pathunnecessarily). As a difference in degree, consider retransmissions and the sliding window protocol. Most wireless links, other than satellite links, can have only a single frame outstanding fromthe sender at a time. That is, the bandwidth-delay product for the link is small enough that not even a whole frame can be stored inside the link. In this case, a small window size is sufficient for goodperformance. For ex- ample, 802.11 uses a stop-and-wait protocol, transmitting or retransmitting each frame and waiting for it to be acknowledged before moving on to the next frame. Having a window size larger than one frame would add complexity without im- proving performance. For wired and optical fiber links, such as (switched) Ether- net or ISP backbones, the error-rate is low enough that link-layer retransmissions can be omitted because the end-to-end retransmissions will repair the residual frame loss. On the other hand, many TCP connections have a bandwidth-delay product that is much larger than a single segment. Consider a connection sending data a- cross the U.S. at 1 Mbps with a round-trip time of 100 msec. Even for this slow connection, 200 Kbit of data will be stored at the receiver in the time it takes to send a segment and receive an acknowledgement. For these situations, a large sliding window must be used. Stop-and-wait will cripple performance. In our ex- ample it would limit performance to one segment every 200 msec, or 5 seg- ments/sec nomatter howfastthenetwork really is. Given that transport protocols generally use larger sliding windows, we will look at the issue of buffering data more carefully. Since a host may have many connections, each of which is treated separately, it may need a substantial amount of buffering for the sliding windows. The buffers are needed at both the sender and the receiver. Certainly they are needed at the sender to hold all transmitted but as yet unacknowledged segments. They are needed there because these seg- ments maybelostandneedtoberetransmitted. 524 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 However, since the sender is buffering, the receiver may or may not dedicate specific buffers to specific connections, as it sees fit. The receiver may, for ex- ample, maintain a single buffer pool shared by all connections. When a segment comes in,anattempt ismade todynamicallyacquire anew buffer', 'Ifoneisavail- able, the segment is accepted; otherwise, it is discarded. Since the sender is pre- pared to retransmit segments lost by the network, no permanent harm is done by having the receiver drop segments, although some resources are wasted. The sender justkeeps tryinguntilitgetsanacknowledgement. The besttrade-off between source buffering anddestination buffering depends on the type of traffic carried by the connection. For low-bandwidth bursty traffic, such as that produced by an interactive terminal, it is reasonable not to dedicate any buffers, but rather to acquire them dynamically at both ends, relying on buff- ering at the sender if segments must occasionally be discarded. On the other hand, for file transfer and other high-bandwidth traffic, it is better if the receiver does dedicate a full window of buffers, to allow the data to flow at maximum speed. Thisisthestrategy thatTCP uses. There still remains the question of how to organize the buffer pool. If most segments are nearly the same size, it is natural to organize the buffers as a pool of identically sized buffers, with one segment per buffer, as in Fig.6-15(a). Howev- er, if there is wide variation insegment size, from shortrequests forWeb pages to large packets in peer-to-peer file transfers, a pool of fixed-sized buffers presents problems. If the buffer size is chosen to be equal to the largest possible segment, space will be wasted whenever a short segment arrives. If the buffer size is cho- sen tobe less than the maximum segment size, multiplebuffers willbeneeded for longsegments, withtheattendant complexity. Another approach to the buffer size problem is to use variable-sized buffers, as inFig.6-15(b). The advantage here isbetter memory utilization,at the price of more complicated buffer management. A third possibility is to dedicate a single large circular buffer per connection, as in Fig. 6-15(c). This system is simple and elegant and does not depend on segment sizes, but makes good use of memory onlywhentheconnectionsare heavily loaded. As connections are opened and closed and as the traffic pattern changes, the sender and receiver need to dynamically adjust their buffer allocations. Conse- quently, the transport protocol should allow a sending host to request buffer space at the other end. Buffers could be allocated per connection,orcollectively, forall theconnectionsrunningbetween the twohosts. Alternatively, the receiver,know- ing its buffer situation (but not knowing the offered traffic) could tell the sender ‘‘Ihave reserved Xbuffers foryou.’’ If the number of open connections shouldin- crease, it may be necessary for an allocation to be reduced, so the protocol should provide forthispossibility. A reasonably general way to manage dynamic buffer allocation is to decouple the buffering from the acknowledgements, in contrast to the sliding window pro- tocols of Chap. 3. Dynamic buffer management means, in effect, a variable-sized SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 525 Segment1 Segment2 Segment3 (a) (b) Segment4 Unused space (c) Figure6-15.

The receiver then grants as many ofthese as itcan afford. Every time the sender transmits a segment, it must decrement its allocation, stopping altogether when the allocation reaches zero', 'The receiver separately piggybacks both acknowledgements and buffer allocations onto the reverse traffic. TCP uses thisscheme, carrying bufferallocations inaheader field called Windowsize. Figure 6-16 shows an example of how dynamic window management might work in a datagram network with 4-bit sequence numbers. In this example, data flowsinsegments fromhostAtohostBandacknowledgementsand buffer alloca- tions flow in segments in the reverse direction. Initially, A wants eight buffers, but it is granted only four of these. It then sends three segments, of which the third is lost. Segment 6 acknowledges receipt of all segments up to and including sequence number 1, thus allowing A to release those buffers, and furthermore informs A that it has permission to send three more segments starting beyond 1 (i.e., segments 2,3,and4). Aknowsthat it has already sent number 2,soitthinks that it may send segments 3 and 4, which it proceeds to do. At this point it is blocked and must wait for more buffer allocation. Timeout-induced retransmis- sions (line 9), however, may occur while blocked, since they use buffers that have already been allocated. In line 10, B acknowledges receipt of all segments up to and including 4 but refuses to let A continue. Such a situation is impossible with the fixed-window protocols of Chap. 3. The next segment from B to A allocates 526 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 another buffer and allows A to continue. This will happen when B has buffer space,likely becausethetransport userhasacceptedmore segment data.

Dynamic buffer allocation. The arrows show the direction of transmission. Anellipsis(...)indicatesalostsegment. Problems with buffer allocation schemes of this kind can arise in datagram networks if control segments can get lost—which they most certainly can. Look at line 16. B has now allocated more buffers to A, but the allocation segment was lost. Oops. Since control segments are not sequenced or timed out, A is now deadlocked. To prevent this situation, each host should periodically send control segments giving the acknowledgementand buffer status oneachconnection. That way, thedeadlock willbebroken, soonerorlater. Untilnowwehave tacitly assumed that the onlylimit imposed onthe sender’s data rate is the amount of buffer space available in the receiver. This is often not the case. Memory was once expensive but prices have fallen dramatically. Hosts may be equipped with sufficient memory that the lack of buffers is rarely, if ever, a problem, even for wide area connections. Of course, this depends on the buffer size being set to be large enough, which has not always been the case for TCP (Zhang etal., 2002). When buffer space no longer limits the maximum flow, another bottleneck will appear: the carrying capacity of the network', 'If adjacent routers can ex- change atmostxpackets/sec andthere are kdisjoint paths between apair ofhosts, there is no way that those hosts can exchange more than kx segments/sec, nomat- ter how much buffer space is available at each end. If the sender pushes too hard SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 527 (i.e., sends more than kx segments/sec), the network will become congested be- cause itwillbeunable todeliver segments asfast astheyare comingin. What is needed is a mechanism that limits transmissions from the sender based on the network’s carrying capacity rather than on the receiver’s buffering capacity. Belsnes (1975) proposed using a sliding window flow-control scheme in which the sender dynamically adjusts the window size to match the network’s carrying capacity. Thismeans thatadynamicslidingwindowcan implement both flow control and congestion control. If the network can handle c segments/sec and the round-trip time (including transmission, propagation, queueing, proc- essing at the receiver, and return of the acknowledgement) is r, the sender’s win- dow should be cr. With a window of this size, the sender normally operates with the pipeline full. Any small decrease in network performance will cause it to block. Since the network capacity available to any given flow varies over time, the window size should be adjusted frequently, to track changes in the carrying capacity. Aswewillsee later, TCP usesasimilar scheme. 6.2.5 Multiplexing Multiplexing, or sharing several conversations over connections, virtual cir- cuits, and physical links plays a role in several layers of the network architecture. In the transport layer, the need for multiplexing can arise in a number of ways. For example, if only one network address is available on a host, all transport con- nections on that machine have to use it. When a segment comes in, some way is needed to tell which process to give it to. This situation, called multiplexing, is showninFig.6-17(a). Inthisfigure, fourdistinct transport connectionsallusethe same network connection(e.g., IPaddress) totheremote host. Multiplexingcan also be useful inthe transport layer foranother reason. Sup- pose, for example, that a host has multiple network paths that it can use. If a user needs more bandwidth or more reliability than one of the network paths can pro- vide, a way out is to have a connection that distributes the traffic among multiple network paths on a round-robin basis, as indicated in Fig. 6-17(b). This modus operandi is called inverse multiplexing. With k network connections open, the effective bandwidth might be increased by a factor of k. An example of inverse multiplexing is SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), which can run aconnectionusingmultiplenetwork interfaces.Incontrast, TCP uses asingle net- work endpoint. Inverse multiplexing is also found at the link layer, when several low-rate linksare usedinparallel asonehigh-rate link. 6.2.6 Crash Recovery If hosts and routers are subject to crashes or connections are long-lived (e.g., large software or media downloads), recovery from these crashes becomes an issue. If the transport entity is entirely within the hosts, recovery from network 528 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 Transportaddress Layer Network 4 address 3 2 Routerlines 1 Torouter (a) (b) Figure6-17. (a)Multiplexing.(b)Inversemultiplexing. and router crashes is straightforward', 'The transport entities expect lost segments allthetime andknowhowtocope withthembyusingretransmissions. A more troublesome problem is how to recover from host crashes. In particu- lar, it may be desirable for clients to be able to continue working when servers crash and quickly reboot. To illustrate the difficulty, let us assume that one host, the client, is sending a long file to another host, the file server, using a simple stop-and-wait protocol. The transport layer onthe server just passes the incoming segments to the transport user, one by one. Partway through the transmission, the server crashes. When it comes back up, its tables are reinitialized, so it no longer knowsprecisely where itwas. In an attempt to recover its previous status, the server might send a broadcast segment to all other hosts, announcing that it has just crashed and requesting that itsclients informitofthestatus ofallopenconnections. Each client can beinone of two states: one segment outstanding, S1, or no segments outstanding, S0. Based on only this state information, the client must decide whether to retransmit themostrecentsegment. Atfirst glance, itwouldseem obvious:the client shouldretransmit if and only if it has an unacknowledged segment outstanding (i.e., is in state S1) when it learns of the crash. However, a closer inspection reveals difficulties with this naive approach. Consider, for example, the situation in which the server’s tran- sportentityfirst sends an acknowledgementand then, when the acknowledgement has been sent, writes to the application process. Writing a segment onto the out- put stream and sending an acknowledgement are two distinct events that cannot be done simultaneously. If a crash occurs after the acknowledgement has been sent but before the write has been fully completed, the client will receive the SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTSOFTRANSPORT PROTOCOLS 529 acknowledgement and thus be in state S0 when the crash recovery announcement arrives. The client will therefore not retransmit, (incorrectly) thinking that the segment hasarrived. Thisdecision bytheclient leads toamissingsegment. At this point you may be thinking: ‘‘That problem can be solved easily. All you have to do is reprogram the transport entity tofirst dothe write and then send the acknowledgement.’’ Try again. Imagine that the write has been done but the crash occurs before the acknowledgement can be sent. The client will be in state S1 and thus retransmit, leading to an undetected duplicate segment in the output stream totheserver application process. No matter how the client and server are programmed, there are always situa- tions where the protocol fails to recover properly. The server can be programmed in one of two ways: acknowledge first or write first. The client can be pro- grammed in one of four ways: always retransmit the last segment, never retrans- mit the last segment, retransmit only in state S0, or retransmit only in state S1. This gives eight combinations, but as we shall see, for each combination there is somesetofevents thatmakes theprotocol fail. Three events are possible at the server: sending an acknowledgement (A), writing to the output process (W), and crashing (C)', 'The three events can occur in six different orderings: AC(W), AWC, C(AW), C(WA), WAC, and WC(A), where the parentheses are used to indicate that neither A nor W can follow C (i.e., once it has crashed, it has crashed). Figure 6-18 shows all eight combinations of client and server strategies and the valid event sequences for each one. Notice that for each strategy there is some sequence of events that causes the protocol to fail. For example, if the client always retransmits, the AWC event will generate anundetectedduplicate,even thoughtheothertwoevents workproperly.

Differentcombinationsofclientandserverstrategies. 530 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 Making the protocol more elaborate does not help. Even if the client and ser- ver exchange several segments before the server attempts to write, so that the cli- ent knows exactly what is about to happen, the client has no way of knowing whether a crash occurred just before or just after the write. The conclusion is inescapable: under our ground rules of no simultaneous events—that is, separate events happen one after another not at the same time—host crash and recovery cannotbemade transparent tohigher layers. Put in more general terms, this result can be restated as ‘‘recovery from a layer N crash can only be done by layer N +1,’’ and then only if the higher layer retains enough status information to reconstruct where it was before the problem occurred. This is consistent with the case mentioned above that the transport layer can recover from failures in the network layer, provided that each end of a connectionkeeps track ofwhere itis. This problem gets us into the issue of what a so-called end-to-end acknowl- edgement really means. In principle, the transport protocol is end-to-end and not chained like the lower layers. Now consider the case of a user entering requests fortransactions against a remote database. Supposethattheremote transport enti- ty is programmed to first pass segments to the next layer up and then acknow- ledge. Even in this case, the receipt of an acknowledgement back at the user’s machine does not necessarily mean that the remote host stayed up long enough to actually updatethe database. Atrulyend-to-end acknowledgement,whose receipt means that the work has actually been doneand lack thereof means that it has not, is probably impossible to achieve. This point is discussed in more detail by Saltzer etal.(1984). 6.3 CONGESTION CONTROL Ifthe transport entitiesonmany machines send too many packets into the net- work tooquickly, the network willbecome congested,withperformance degraded as packets are delayed and lost. Controlling congestion to avoid this problem is the combined responsibility of the network and transport layers. Congestion oc- curs at routers, so it is detected at the network layer. However, congestion is ulti- mately caused by traffic sent into the network by the transport layer', 'The only ef- fective way to control congestion is for the transport protocols to send packets intothenetwork more slowly. In Chap. 5, we studied congestion control mechanisms in the network layer. In this section, we will study the other half of the problem, congestion control mechanisms in the transport layer. After describing the goals of congestion con- trol, we will describe how hosts can regulate the rate at which they send packets into the network. The Internet relies heavily on the transport layer for congestion control, andspecific algorithms are builtintoTCP andotherprotocols. SEC. 6.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL 531 6.3.1 Desirable Bandwidth Allocation Before we describe how to regulate traffic, we must understand what we are trying to achieve by running a congestion control algorithm. That is, we must specify the state in which a good congestion control algorithm will operate the network. The goal ismore than tosimply avoid congestion. Itistofindagoodal- location of bandwidth to the transport entities that are using the network. A good allocation will deliver good performance because it uses all the available band- widthbutavoids congestion,itwillbefairacross competing transport entities,and it will quickly track changes in traffic demands. We will make each of these cri- teria more precise inturn. Efficiency andPower An efficient allocation of bandwidth across transport entities will use all of the network capacity that isavailable. However, it isnotquite right tothink that if there is a 100-Mbps link, five transport entities should get 20 Mbps each. They should usually get less than 20Mbps for goodperformance. The reason is that the traffic is often bursty. Recall that in Sec. 5.3 we described the goodput (or rate of useful packets arriving at the receiver) as a function of the offered load. This curve and a matching curve for the delay as a function of the offered load are giveninFig.6-19. Capacity Congestion collapse Offeredload(packets/sec) Offeredload(packets/sec) (a) )ces/stekcap(tupdooG Desired response )sdnoces(yaleD Onsetof congestion (b) Figure6-19. (a)Goodputand(b)delayasafunctionofofferedload. As the load increases in Fig.6-19(a) goodput initially increases at the same rate, but as the load approaches the capacity, goodput rises more gradually. This falloff is because bursts of traffic can occasionally mount up and cause some losses at buffers inside the network. If the transport protocol is poorly designed and retransmits packets that have been delayed but not lost, the network can enter congestion collapse. In this state, senders are furiously sending packets, but in- creasingly littleusefulworkisbeingaccomplished. 532 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 The corresponding delay is given in Fig.6-19(b) Initially the delay is fixed, representing the propagation delay across the network. Asthe load approaches the capacity, the delay rises, slowly at first and then much more rapidly. This is again because of bursts of traffic that tend to mound up at high load. The delay cannot really go to infinity, except in a model in which the routers have infinite buffers. Instead, packets willbelostafter experiencing themaximum buffering delay. For both goodput and delay, performance begins to degrade at the onset of congestion. Intuitively, we will obtain the best performance from the network if we allocate bandwidth up until the delay starts to climb rapidly', 'This point is be- low the capacity. To identify it, Kleinrock (1979) proposed the metric of power, where load power = delay Power will initially rise with offered load, as delay remains small and roughly constant, butwillreachamaximum and fall as delay growsrapidly. The loadwith the highest power represents an efficient load for the transport entity to place on thenetwork. Max-Min Fairness In the preceding discussion, we did not talk about how to divide bandwidth between different transport senders. This sounds like a simple question to answer—give all the senders an equal fraction of the bandwidth—but it involves several considerations. Perhaps the first consideration is to ask what this problem has to do with con- gestion control. After all, ifthenetwork givesasender someamountofbandwidth to use, the sender should just use that much bandwidth. However, it is often the case that networks do not have a strict bandwidth reservation for each flow or connection. They may for some flows if quality of service is supported, but many connections will seek to use whatever bandwidth is available or be lumped toget- her by the network under a common allocation. For example, IETF’s differentiat- ed services separates traffic into two classes and connections compete for band- width within each class. IP routers often have all connections competing for the same bandwidth. In this situation, it is the congestion control mechanism that is allocating bandwidth tothecompeting connections. A second consideration is what a fair portion means for flows in a network. It is simple enough if N flows use a single link, in which case they can all have 1/N of the bandwidth (although efficiency will dictate that they use slightly less if the traffic is bursty). But what happens if the flows have different, but overlapping, network paths? For example, one flow may cross three links, and the other flows may cross one link. The three-link flow consumes more network resources. It might be fairer in some sense to give it less bandwidth than the one-link flows. It SEC. 6.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL 533 should certainly be possible to support more one-link flows by reducing the band- width of the three-link flow. This point demonstrates an inherent tension between fairness andefficiency. However, we will adopt a notion of fairness that does not depend on the length of the network path. Even with this simple model, giving connections an equal fraction of bandwidth is a bit complicated because different connections will take different paths throughthe network and these paths willthemselves have different capacities. In this case, it is possible for a flow to be bottlenecked on a downstream link and take a smaller portion of an upstream link than other flows; reducing the bandwidth of the other flows would slow them down but would not helpthebottleneckedflowatall. The form of fairness that is often desired for network usage is max-min fair- ness. An allocation is max-min fair if the bandwidth given to one flow cannot be increased without decreasing the bandwidth given to another flow with an alloca- tion that is no larger', 'That is, increasing the bandwidth of a flow will only make thesituation worse forflowsthatare lesswell off. Let ussee an example. A max-min fair allocation is shown for a network with four flows, A,B, C, and D, in Fig.6-20. Each of the linksbetween routers has the same capacity, taken to be 1 unit, though in the general case the links will have different capacities. Three flows compete for the bottom-left link between routers R4 and R5. Each of these flows therefore gets 1/3 of the link. The remaining flow, A, competes with B on the link from R2 to R3. Since B has an allocation of 1/3, A gets the remaining 2/3 of the link. Notice that all of the other links have spare capacity. However, thiscapacity cannotbegiventoanyoftheflowswithout decreasing the capacity of another, lower flow. For example, if more of the band- width onthe link between R2andR3isgiven toflow B,there willbelessforflow A. This is reasonable as flow A already has more bandwidth. However, the ca- pacity of flow C or D (or both) must be decreased to give more bandwidth to B, and these flows will have less bandwidth than B. Thus, the allocation is max-min fair. A 2/3 2/3 A R1 R2 1/3 R3 B 1/3 B 1/3 1/3 1/3 C C R4 1/3 R5 1/3 R6 D D Figure6-20. Max-minbandwidthallocationforfourflows. Max-min allocations can be computed given a global knowledge of the net- work. Anintuitiveway tothinkaboutthem istoimagine that therate forallofthe 534 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 flowsstarts atzero andisslowlyincreased. Whentherate reachesa bottleneckfor any flow, then that flow stops increasing. The other flows all continue toincrease, sharing equally in the available capacity, until they too reach their respective bot- tlenecks. A third consideration is the level over which to consider fairness. A network could be fair at the level of connections, connections between a pair of hosts, or all connections per host. We examined this issue when we were discussing WFQ (Weighted Fair Queueing) in Sec. 5.4 and concluded that each ofthese definitions has its problems. For example, defining fairness per host means that a busy server will fare no better than a mobile phone, while defining fairness per connection encourages hosts to open more connections. Given that there is no clear answer, fairness is often considered per connection, but precise fairness is usually not a concern. It is more important in practice that no connection be starved of band- width than that all connections get precisely the same amount of bandwidth. In fact, with TCP it is possible to open multiple connections and compete for band- width more aggressively. This tactic is used by bandwidth-hungry applications suchasBitTorrent forpeer-to-peer file sharing. Convergence Afinal criterion isthat the congestion control algorithm converge quickly toa fair and efficient allocation of bandwidth. The discussion of the desirable operat- ing point above assumes a static network environment. However, connections are always coming and goingin a network, andthe bandwidth needed byagiven con- nection will vary over time too, for example, as a user browses Web pages and occasionallydownloads large videos', 'Because of the variation in demand, the ideal operating point for the network varies over time. A good congestion control algorithm should rapidly converge to the ideal operating point, and it should track that point as it changes over time. If the convergence is too slow, the algorithm will never be close to the changing op- erating point. If the algorithm is not stable, it may fail to converge to the right pointinsome cases, oreven oscillatearoundtherightpoint. An example of a bandwidth allocation that changes over time and converges quickly is shown in Fig.6-21. Initially, flow 1 has all of the bandwidth. One sec- ond later, flow 2 starts. It needs bandwidth as well. The allocation quickly changes to give each of these flows half the bandwidth. At 4seconds, a third flow joins. However, this flow uses only 20% of the bandwidth, which is less than its fair share (which is a third). Flows 1 and 2 quickly adjust, dividing the available bandwidth to each have 40% of the bandwidth. At 9 seconds, the second flow leaves, andthethirdflowremains unchanged. The firstflowquicklycaptures 80% of the bandwidth. At all times, the total allocated bandwidth is approximately 100%, so that the network is fully used, and competing flows get equal treatment (butdonothave tousemorebandwidth thantheyneed).

Changingbandwidthallocationovertime. 6.3.2 Regulating the Sending Rate Now it is time for the main course. How do we regulate the sending rates to obtain a desirable bandwidth allocation? The sending rate may be limited by two factors. The first is flow control, in the case that there is insufficient buffering at the receiver.The secondiscongestion,inthe case that there isinsufficient capaci- ty in the network. In Fig. 6-22, we see this problem illustrated hydraulically. In Fig.6-22(a), we see a thick pipe leading to a small-capacity receiver. This is a flow-control limited situation. As long as the sender does not send more water than the bucket can contain, no water will be lost. In Fig. 6-22(b), the limiting factor isnotthe bucket capacity, but the internal carrying capacity of the network. If too much water comes in too fast, it will back up and some will be lost (in this case, byoverflowing thefunnel). These cases may appear similar to the sender, as transmitting too fast causes packets to be lost. However, they have different causes and call for different solu- tions. We have already talked about a flow-control solution with a variable-sized window. Now we will consider a congestion control solution. Since either of these problems can occur, the transport protocol will in general need to run both solutionsandslowdownifeither problem occurs. The way that a transport protocol should regulate the sending rate depends on the form of the feedback returned by the network. Different network layers may return different kindsoffeedback. The feedback may beexplicit orimplicit, andit maybeprecise orimprecise. An example of an explicit, precise design is when routers tell the sources the rate at which they may send', 'Designs intheliteraturesuchasXCP(eXplicit Con- gestion Protocol) operate in this manner (Katabi et al., 2002). An explicit, impre- cise design is the use of ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) with TCP. Inthis design, routers set bits on packets that experience congestion to warn the senders toslowdown,buttheydonottell themhowmuchtoslowdown. 536 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 Transmission rateadjustment Transmission network Internal congestion Small-capacity Large-capacity receiver receiver (a) (b) Figure6-22. (a) A fast network feeding a low-capacity receiver. (b) A slow networkfeedingahigh-capacityreceiver. In other designs, there is no explicit signal. FAST TCP measures the round- trip delay and uses that metric as a signal to avoid congestion (Wei et al., 2006). Finally, in the form of congestion control most prevalent in the Internet today, TCP with drop-tail or RED routers, packet loss is inferred and used to signal that the network has become congested. There are many variants of this form of TCP, including CUBIC TCP, which is used in Linux (Ha et al., 2008). Combinations are also possible. For example, Windows includes Compound TCP that uses both packet loss and delay as feedback signals (Tan et al., 2006). These designs are summarized inFig.6-23. If an explicit and precise signal is given, the transport entity can use that sig- nal to adjust its rate to the new operating point. For example, if XCP tells senders the rate to use, the senders may simply use that rate. In the other cases, however, some guesswork is involved. In the absence of a congestion signal, the senders should decrease their rates. When a congestion signal is given, the senders should decrease their rates. The way in which the rates are increased or decreased is givenbyacontrol law. These laws have amajor effect onperformance. SEC. 6.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL 537 Protocol Signal Explicit? Precise?

Signalsofsomecongestioncontrolprotocols. Chiu and Jain (1989) studied the case of binary congestion feedback and con- cluded that AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) is the appropr- iate control law to arrive at the efficient and fair operating point. To argue this case, they constructed a graphical argument for the simple case of two con- nections competing for the bandwidth of a single link. The graph in Fig.6-24 shows the bandwidth allocated to user 1 on the x-axis and to user 2 on the y-axis. When theallocation isfair, bothusers willreceivethe same amountofbandwidth. This is shown by the dotted fairness line. When the allocations sum to 100%, the capacity of the link, the allocation is efficient. This is shown by the dotted effi- ciency line. A congestion signal is given by the network to both users when the sum of their allocations crosses this line. The intersection of these lines is the de- sired operating point, when bothusers have the same bandwidth andallofthenet- workbandwidth isused.

Additiveandmultiplicativebandwidthadjustments. Consider what happens from some starting allocation if bothuser 1and user 2 additively increase their respective bandwidths over time', 'For example, the users may each increase their sending rate by 1 Mbps every second. Eventually, the 538 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 operating point crosses the efficiency line andbothusers receiveacongestionsig- nal from the network. At this stage, they must reduce their allocations. However, an additive decrease would simply cause them to oscillate along an additive line. This situation is shown in Fig. 6-24. The behavior will keep the operating point close toefficient, butitwillnotnecessarilybefair. Similarly, consider the case when both users multiplicatively increase their bandwidth over time untilthey receiveacongestionsignal. For example, theusers may increase their sending rate by 10% every second. If they then multiplica- tively decrease their sending rates, the operating point of the users will simply oscillate along a multiplicative line. This behavior is also shown in Fig.6-24. The multiplicativelinehasadifferent slope thantheadditiveline. (Itpointstothe origin, while the additive line has an angle of 45 degrees.) But it is otherwise no better. Inneither case willthe users convergetothe optimal sending rates thatare bothfair andefficient. Now consider the case that the users additively increase their bandwidth al- locations and then multiplicatively decrease them when congestion is signaled. This behavior is the AIMD control law, and it is shown in Fig.6-25. It can be seen that the path traced by this behavior does converge to the optimal point that is both fair and efficient. This convergence happens no matter what the starting point, making AIMD broadly useful. By the same argument, the only other com- bination, multiplicative increase and additive decrease, would diverge from the optimal point.

AIMD is the control law that is used by TCP, based on this argument and an- other stability argument (that it is easy to drive the network into congestion and difficult to recover, so the increase policy should be gentle and the decrease poli- cy aggressive). It is not quite fair, since TCP connections adjust their window size bya given amount every round-trip time. Different connections will have dif- ferent round-trip times. This leads to a bias in which connections to closer hosts receivemorebandwidth thanconnectionstodistant hosts,allelse beingequal. SEC. 6.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL 539 In Sec. 6.5, we will describe in detail how TCP implements an AIMD control law to adjust the sending rate and provide congestion control. This task is more difficult than it sounds because rates are measured over some interval and traffic is bursty. Instead of adjusting the rate directly, a strategy that is often used in practice is to adjust the size of a sliding window. TCP uses this strategy. If the window size is W and the round-trip time is RTT, the equivalent rate is W/RTT. This strategy is easy to combine with flow control, which already uses a window, and has the advantage that the sender paces packets using acknowledgements and hence slows down in one RTT if it stops receiving reports that packets are leaving thenetwork. As a final issue, there may be many different transport protocols that send traffic into the network', 'What will happen if the different protocols compete with different control laws toavoid congestion? Unequal bandwidth allocations, that is what. Since TCP is the dominant form of congestion control in the Internet, there is significant community pressure for new transport protocols to be designed so that they compete fairly withit. The early streaming media protocols caused prob- lems by excessively reducing TCP throughput because they did not compete fairly. This led to the notion of TCP-friendly congestion control in which TCP and non-TCP transport protocols can be freely mixed with no ill effects (Floyd et al., 2000). 6.3.3 Wireless Issues Transport protocols such as TCP that implement congestion control should be independent of the underlying network and link layer technologies. That is a good theory, but in practice there are issues with wireless networks. The main issue is that packet loss is often used as a congestion signal, including by TCP as we have justdiscussed. Wireless networks lose packets all the time duetotransmission er- rors. With the AIMD control law, high throughput requires very small levels of packet loss. Analyses by Padhye et al. (1998) show that the throughput goes upas the inverse square-root of the packet loss rate. What this means in practice is that the loss rate for fast TCP connections is very small; 1% is a moderate loss rate, and by the time the loss rate reaches 10% the connection has effectively stopped working. However, for wireless networks such as 802.11 LANs, frame loss rates of at least 10% are common. This difference means that, absent protective meas- ures, congestion control schemes that use packet loss as a signal will unneces- sarily throttleconnectionsthatrunover wireless linkstoverylowrates. To function well, the only packet losses that the congestion control algorithm should observe are losses due to insufficient bandwidth, not losses due to trans- mission errors. One solution to this problem is to mask the wireless losses by using retransmissions over the wireless link. For example, 802.11 uses a stop- and-wait protocol to deliver each frame, retrying transmissions multiple times if 540 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 need be before reporting apacket loss tothe higher layer. Inthenormal case, each packet is delivered despite transient transmission errors that are not visible to the higher layers. Fig.6-26 shows a path with a wired and wireless link for which the masking strategy is used. There are two aspects to note. First, the sender does not neces- sarily knowthat the path includes a wireless link, since all it sees is the wired link to which it is attached. Internet paths are heterogeneous and there is no general method for the sender to tell what kind of links comprise the path. This compli- cates the congestion control problem, as there is no easy way to use one protocol forwireless linksandanother protocol forwired links. Transportwithend-to-endcongestioncontrol(loss=congestion) Wiredlink Wirelesslink Sender Receiver Linklayerretransmission (loss=transmissionerror) Figure6-26. Congestioncontroloverapathwithawirelesslink. The second aspect is a puzzle. The figure shows two mechanisms that are driven by loss: link layer frame retransmissions, and transport layer congestion control. The puzzle is how these two mechanisms can co-exist without getting confused', 'After all, a loss should cause only one mechanism to take action be- cause it is either a transmission error or a congestion signal. It cannot be both. If both mechanisms take action (by retransmitting the frame and slowing down the sending rate) then we are back to the original problem of transports that run far too slowly over wireless links. Consider this puzzle for a moment and see if you can solveit. The solution is that the two mechanisms act at different timescales. Link layer retransmissions happen on the order of microseconds to milliseconds for wireless links such as 802.11. Loss timers in transport protocols fire on the order of milliseconds to seconds. The difference is three orders of magnitude. This al- lows wireless links to detect frame losses and retransmit frames to repair trans- missionerrors longbefore packet lossisinferred bythetransport entity. The masking strategy is sufficient to let most transport protocols run well across most wireless links. However, it is not always a fitting solution. Some wireless links have long round-trip times, such as satellites. For these links other techniques must beused tomask loss, such as FEC (Forward ErrorCorrection), or thetransport protocol mustuseanon-losssignal forcongestioncontrol. SEC. 6.3 CONGESTIONCONTROL 541 A second issue with congestion control over wireless links is variable capaci- ty. That is, the capacity of a wireless link changes over time, sometimes abruptly, as nodes move and the signal-to-noise ratio varies with the changing channel con- ditions. This is unlike wired links whose capacity is fixed. The transport protocol must adapt tothe changing capacity of wireless links, otherwise it will either con- gestthenetwork orfail tousetheavailable capacity. One possible solution to this problem is simply not to worry about it. This strategy is feasible because congestion control algorithms must already handle the case of new users entering the network or existing users changing their sending rates. Even though the capacity of wired links is fixed, the changing behavior of other users presents itself as variability in the bandwidth that is available to a given user. Thus it is possible to simply run TCP over a path with an802.11wire- lesslinkandobtainreasonable performance. However, when there is much wireless variability, transport protocols de- signed forwired links may have troublekeeping upand deliver poorperformance. The solution in this case is a transport protocol that is designed for wireless links. A particularly challenging setting is a wireless mesh network in which multiple, interfering wireless links must be crossed, routes change due to mobility, and there is lots of loss. Research in this area is ongoing. See Li et al. (2009) for an example ofwireless transport protocol design. 6.4 THE INTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: UDP The Internet has two main protocols in the transport layer, a connectionless protocol and a connection-oriented one. The protocols complement each other. The connectionless protocol is UDP. It does almost nothing beyond sending pack- ets between applications, letting applications build their own protocols on top as needed. The connection-oriented protocol is TCP. It does almost everything. It makes connections and adds reliabilitywith retransmissions, along with flow con- trolandcongestioncontrol, all onbehalf oftheapplications thatuseit', 'In the following sections, we will study UDP and TCP. We will start with UDP because it is simplest. We will also look at two uses of UDP. Since UDP is a transport layer protocol that typically runs in the operating system and protocols that use UDP typically run in user space, these uses might be considered applica- tions. However, the techniques they use are useful for many applications and are better considered tobelongtoatransport service, sowewillcover themhere. 6.4.1 Introduction to UDP The Internet protocol suite supports a connectionless transport protocol called UDP (User Datagram Protocol). UDP provides a way for applications to send encapsulated IP datagrams without having to establish a connection. UDP is de- scribed inRFC 768. 542 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 UDP transmits segments consisting of an 8-byte header followed by the pay- load. The header is shown in Fig.6-27. The two ports serve to identify the end- points within the source and destination machines. When a UDP packet arrives, its payload is handed to the process attached to the destination port. This attach- ment occurs when the BIND primitive or something similar is used, as we saw in Fig.6-6 for TCP (the binding process is the same for UDP). Think of ports as mailboxes that applications can rent to receive packets. We will have more to say about them when we describe TCP, which also uses ports. In fact, the main value of UDP over just using raw IP is the addition of the source and destination ports. Without the port fields, the transport layer would not know what to do with each incoming packet. With them, it delivers the embedded segment to the correct ap- plication. 32Bits Sourceport Destinationport UDPlength UDPchecksum Figure6-27. TheUDPheader. The source port is primarily needed when a reply must be sent back to the source. By copying the Source port field from the incoming segment into the Destination port field of the outgoing segment, the process sending the reply can specify which process onthesendingmachine istogetit. The UDP length field includes the 8-byte header and the data. The minimum length is8bytes, tocover the header. The maximum lengthis65,515bytes, which is lower than the largest number that willfit in16bits because of the size limit on IPpackets. An optional Checksum is also provided for extra reliability. It checksums the header, the data, and a conceptual IP pseudoheader. When performing this com- putation, the Checksum field is set tozero and the data field is padded out with an additional zero byte if its length is an odd number. The checksum algorithm is simply to add up all the 16-bit words in one’s complement and to take the one’s complement ofthe sum. Asaconsequence, whenthereceiverperforms thecalcu- lation on the entire segment, including the Checksum field, the result should be 0. If the checksum is not computed, it is stored as a 0, since by a happy coincidence of one’s complement arithmetic a true computed 0 is stored as all 1s. However, turning itoffisfoolish unlessthequalityofthedata doesnotmatter (e.g., fordigi- tized speech). The pseudoheader for the case of IPv4 is shown in Fig.6-28', 'It contains the 32-bit IPv4 addresses ofthe source anddestination machines, theprotocol number for UDP (17), and the byte count for the UDP segment (including the header). It SEC. 6.4 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: UDP 543 is different but analogous for IPv6. Including the pseudoheader in the UDP checksum computation helps detect misdelivered packets, but including it also violates the protocol hierarchy since the IP addresses in it belong to the IP layer, nottotheUDPlayer. TCP usesthesame pseudoheaderforitschecksum. 32Bits Sourceaddress Destinationaddress 00000000 Protocol=17 UDPlength Figure6-28. TheIPv4pseudoheaderincludedintheUDPchecksum. It is probably worth mentioning explicitly some of the things that UDP does not do. It does not do flow control, congestion control, or retransmission upon receipt of a bad segment. All of that is up to the user processes. What it does do is provide an interface to the IP protocol with the added feature of demultiplexing multipleprocesses usingthe portsand optional end-to-end error detection. That is allitdoes. For applications that need to have precise control over the packet flow, error control, or timing, UDP provides just what the doctor ordered. One area where it isespecially useful isinclient-server situations. Often, the client sends a shortre- quest to the server and expects a short reply back. If either the request or the reply is lost, the client can just time out and try again. Not only is the code sim- ple, but fewer messages are required (one in each direction) than with a protocol requiring aninitialsetuplikeTCP. An application that uses UDP this way is DNS (Domain Name System), which we will study in Chap. 7. In brief, a program that needs to look up the IP address of some host name, for example, www.cs.berkeley.edu, can send a UDP packet containing the host name to a DNS server. The server replies with a UDP packet containing the host’s IP address. No setup is needed in advance and no re- lease isneeded afterward. Justtwomessages gooverthenetwork. 6.4.2 Remote Procedure Call Inacertain sense, sendingamessage toaremote hostandgettingareply back is a lot like making a function call ina programming language. Inbothcases, you start with one or more parameters and you get back a result. This observation has led people totrytoarrange request-reply interactions onnetworks tobecast inthe 544 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 form of procedure calls. Such an arrangement makes network applications much easier to program and more familiar to deal with. For example, just imagine a procedure named get IP address(host name) that works by sending a UDP packet to a DNS server and waiting for the reply, timing out and trying again if one is not forthcoming quickly enough. In this way, all the details of networking can behiddenfromtheprogrammer. The key work in this area was done by Birrell and Nelson (1984). In a nut- shell, what Birrell and Nelson suggested was allowing programs to call proce- dures located onremote hosts. When aprocess onmachine 1calls a procedure on machine 2, the calling process on 1 is suspended and execution of the called pro- cedure takes placeon2. Information can betransported from the caller to the cal- lee inthe parameters andcan come back intheprocedure result', 'Nomessage pas- sing is visible to the application programmer. This technique is known as RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and has become the basis for many networking appli- cations. Traditionally, the calling procedure is known as the client and the called procedure isknownastheserver, andwewillusethosenames here too. The idea behind RPC istomake a remote procedure call lookas much as pos- sible like a local one. In the simplest form, to call a remote procedure, the client program must beboundwitha small library procedure, called the client stub, that represents the server procedure in the client’s address space. Similarly, the server is bound with a procedure called the server stub. These procedures hide the fact thattheprocedure call fromtheclient totheserver isnotlocal. The actual steps in making an RPC are shown in Fig.6-29. Step 1 is the cli- ent calling the client stub. This call is a local procedure call, with the parameters pushed onto the stack in the normal way. Step 2 is the client stub packing the pa- rameters into a message and making a system call to send the message. Packing the parameters is called marshaling. Step 3 is the operating system sending the message from the client machine to the server machine. Step 4 is the operating system passingtheincoming packet totheserver stub. Finally, step5isthe server stub calling the server procedure with the unmarshaled parameters. The reply tracesthe same pathintheother direction. The key item tonote here is that the client procedure, written by the user, just makes a normal (i.e., local) procedure call to the client stub, which has the same name astheserver procedure. Since the client procedure andclient stubare inthe same address space, the parameters are passed in the usual way. Similarly, the server procedure is called by a procedure in its address space with the parameters it expects. To the server procedure, nothing is unusual. In this way, instead of I/O being done on sockets, network communication is done by faking a normal procedure call. Despite the conceptual elegance of RPC, there are a few snakes hiding under the grass. A big one is the use ofpointer parameters. Normally, passing a pointer to a procedure is not a problem. The called procedure can use the pointer in the same way the caller can because both procedures live in the same virtual address SEC. 6.4 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: UDP 545 ClientCPU ServerCPU Client Server 1 5 stub stub Client Server 2 4 Operatingsystem Operatingsystem 3 Network Figure6-29. Stepsinmakingaremoteprocedurecall.Thestubsareshaded. space. With RPC, passing pointers is impossible because the client and server are indifferent address spaces. In some cases, tricks can be used to make it possible to pass pointers. Sup- pose that the first parameter is a pointer to an integer, k. The client stub can marshal kandsend italongtothe server. The server stubthen creates a pointer to k and passes it to the server procedure, just as it expects. When the server proce- dure returns control to the server stub, the latter sends k back to the client, where the new k is copied over the old one, just in case the server changed it', 'In effect, the standard calling sequence of call-by-reference has been replaced by call-by- copy-restore. Unfortunately, this trick does not always work, for example, if the pointer points to a graph or other complex data structure. For this reason, some restrictions must be placed on parameters to procedures called remotely, as we shall see. A second problem is that in weakly typed languages, like C, it is perfectly legal to write a procedure that computes the inner productof two vectors (arrays), without specifying how large either one is. Each could be terminated by a special value known only to the calling and called procedures. Under these circum- stances, it isessentially impossible forthe client stub tomarshal the parameters: it hasnowayofdetermining howlarge theyare. A third problem is that it is not always possible to deduce the types of the pa- rameters, not even from a formal specification or the code itself. An example is printf, which may have any number of parameters (at least one), and the parame- ters can be anarbitrary mixture ofintegers, shorts,longs,characters, strings, float- ing-point numbers of various lengths, and other types. Trying to call printf as a remote procedure would be practically impossible because C is so permissive. However, a rule saying that RPC can be used provided that youdonot program in C(orC++) wouldnotbepopularwithalotofprogrammers. 546 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 A fourth problem relates to the use of global variables. Normally, the calling and called procedure can communicate by using global variables, in addition to communicating via parameters. But if the called procedure is moved to a remote machine, thecode willfail becausethe globalvariables are nolongershared. These problems are not meant to suggest that RPC is hopeless. In fact, it is widely used,butsomerestrictions are needed tomake itworkwell inpractice. In terms of transport layer protocols, UDP is a good base on which to imple- ment RPC. Both requests and replies may be sent as a single UDP packet in the simplest case andtheoperation can befast. However, animplementation mustin- clude other machinery as well. Because the request or the reply may be lost, the client must keep a timer to retransmit the request. Note that a reply serves as an implicit acknowledgement for a request, so the request need not be separately acknowledged. Sometimes the parameters or results may be larger than the maxi- mum UDP packet size, in which case some protocol is needed to deliver large messages. If multiple requests and replies can overlap (as in the case of concur- rent programming), anidentifier isneeded tomatch therequest withthereply. A higher-level concern is that the operation may not be idempotent (i.e., safe to repeat). The simple case is idempotent operations such as DNS requests and replies. The client can safely retransmit these requests again and again if no replies are forthcoming. It does not matter whether the server never received the request, or it was the reply that was lost. The answer, when it finally arrives, will be the same (assuming the DNS database is not updated in the meantime)', 'How- ever, not all operations are idempotent, for example, because they have important side-effects such as incrementing a counter. RPC for these operations requires stronger semantics so that when the programmer calls a procedure it is not exe- cuted multiple times. In this case, it may be necessary to set up a TCP connection andsendtherequest overitrather thanusingUDP. 6.4.3 Real-Time Transport Protocols Client-server RPC is one area in which UDP is widely used. Another one is for real-time multimedia applications. In particular, as Internet radio, Internet te- lephony, music-on-demand, videoconferencing, video-on-demand, and other mul- timedia applications became more commonplace, people have discovered that each application was reinventing more or less the same real-time transport proto- col. It gradually became clear that having a generic real-time transport protocol formultipleapplications wouldbeagoodidea. Thuswas RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) born. It is described inRFC 3550 and is now in widespread use for multimedia applications. We will describe two aspects of real-time transport. The first is the RTP protocol for transporting audio and video data in packets. The second is the processing that takes place, mostly at the receiver, to play out the audio and video at the right time. These functions fitintotheprotocol stack asshowninFig.6-30. SEC. 6.4 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: UDP 547 Ethernet IP UDP RTP User Multimediaapplication header headerheader header space RTP Socketinterface RTPpayload UDP OS IP UDPpayload Kernel Ethernet IPpayload Ethernetpayload (a) (b) Figure6-30. (a)ThepositionofRTPintheprotocolstack.(b)Packetnesting. RTP normally runsinuser spaceover UDP (in the operating system). It oper- ates as follows. The multimedia application consists of multiple audio, video, text, and possibly other streams. These are fed into the RTP library, which is in user space along with the application. This library multiplexes the streams and encodes them in RTP packets, which it stuffs into a socket. On the operating sys- tem side of the socket, UDP packets are generated to wrap the RTP packets and handed to IP for transmission over a link such as Ethernet. The reverse process happens at the receiver. The multimedia application eventually receives multi- media data from the RTP library. It is responsible for playing out the media. The protocol stack for this situation is shown in Fig.6-30(a). The packet nesting is showninFig.6-30(b). As a consequence of this design, it is a little hard to say which layer RTP is in. Since itrunsinuser spaceand is linkedtotheapplication program, itcertainly looks like an application protocol. On the other hand, it is a generic, application- independent protocol that just provides transport facilities, so it also looks like a transport protocol. Probably the best description is that it is a transport protocol that just happens to be implemented in the application layer, which is why we are covering itinthischapter. RTP—The Real-time Transport Protocol The basic function of RTP is to multiplex several real-time data streams onto a single stream of UDP packets. The UDP stream can be sent to a single destina- tion(unicasting) ortomultipledestinations (multicasting). BecauseRTP just uses normal UDP, its packets are not treated specially by the routers unless some nor- mal IP quality-of-service features are enabled', 'In particular, there are no special guarantees aboutdelivery, andpackets maybelost,delayed, corrupted, etc. The RTP format contains several features to help receivers work with multi- media information. Each packet sent in an RTP stream is given a number one 548 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 higher than its predecessor. This numbering allows the destination todetermine if any packets are missing. If a packet is missing, the best action for the destination to take is up to the application. It may be to skip a video frame if the packets are carrying video data, or to approximate the missing value by interpolation if the packets are carrying audio data. Retransmission is not a practical option since the retransmitted packet would probably arrive too late to be useful. As a conse- quence, RTP has noacknowledgements, and no mechanism to request retransmis- sions. Each RTP payload may contain multiple samples, and they may be coded any way that the application wants. To allow for interworking, RTP defines several profiles (e.g., a single audio stream), and for each profile, multiple encoding for- mats may be allowed. For example, a single audio stream may be encoded as 8- bit PCM samples at 8 kHz using delta encoding, predictive encoding, GSM en- coding, MP3 encoding, and so on. RTP provides a header field in which the source can specify the encoding but is otherwise not involved in how encoding is done. Another facility many real-time applications need is timestamping. The idea here is to allow the source to associate a timestamp with the first sample in each packet. The timestamps are relative to the start of the stream, so only the dif- ferences between timestamps are significant. The absolute values have no mean- ing. As we will describe shortly, this mechanism allows the destination to do a small amount of buffering and play each sample the right number of milliseconds after the start ofthe stream, independently ofwhen the packet containing the sam- plearrived. Not only does timestamping reduce the effects of variation in network delay, but it also allows multiple streams to be synchronized with each other. For ex- ample, a digital television program might have a video stream and two audio streams. The two audio streams could be for stereo broadcasts or for handling films with an original language soundtrackand a soundtrack dubbed into the local language, giving the viewer a choice. Each stream comes from a different physi- cal device, but if they are timestamped from a single counter, they can be played back synchronously,even if the streams are transmittedand/or receivedsomewhat erratically. The RTP header is illustrated in Fig. 6-31. It consists of three 32-bit words and potentially some extensions. The first word contains the Version field, which is already at 2. Let us hope this version is very close to the ultimate version since there is only one code point left (although 3 could be defined as meaning that the real versionwas inanextension word). The P bit indicates that the packet has been padded to a multiple of 4 bytes', 'The last padding byte tells how many bytes were added. The X bit indicates that an extension header is present. The format and meaning of the extension header are not defined. The only thing that is defined is that the first word of the exten- siongivesthelength. Thisisanescape hatch foranyunforeseen requirements. SEC. 6.4 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: UDP 549 32bits Ver. P X CC M Payloadtype Sequencenumber Timestamp Synchronizationsourceidentifier Contributingsourceidentifier Figure6-31. TheRTPheader. The CC field tells how many contributing sources are present, from 0 to 15 (see below). The M bit is an application-specific marker bit. It can be used to mark the start of a video frame, the start of a word in an audio channel, or some- thing else that the application understands. The Payload type field tells which en- coding algorithm has been used (e.g., uncompressed 8-bit audio, MP3, etc.). Since every packet carries thisfield, theencoding can change duringtransmission. The Sequence number is just a counter that is incremented on each RTP packet sent. Itisusedtodetect lostpackets. The Timestamp isproducedbythe stream’s source to note when the first sam- ple in the packet was made. This value can help reduce timing variability called jitterat the receiver bydecoupling the playback from the packet arrival time. The Synchronization source identifier tells which stream the packet belongs to. It is the method used to multiplex and demultiplex multiple data streams onto a single stream of UDP packets. Finally, the Contributing source identifiers, if any, are used when mixers are present in the studio. In that case, the mixer is the syn- chronizing source, andthestreams beingmixedare listed here. RTCP—The Real-time Transport Control Protocol RTP has a little sister protocol (little sibling protocol?) called RTCP (Real- time Transport Control Protocol). It is defined along with RTP in RFC 3550 and handles feedback, synchronization, and the user interface. It does not tran- sportanymedia samples. The first function can be used toprovide feedback ondelay, variation in delay or jitter, bandwidth, congestion, and other network properties to the sources. This information can be used by the encoding process to increase the data rate (and give better quality) when the network is functioning well and to cut back the data 550 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 rate when there is trouble in the network. By providing continuous feedback, the encoding algorithms can be continuously adapted to provide the best quality pos- sible under the current circumstances. For example, if the bandwidth increases or decreases during the transmission, the encoding may switch from MP3 to 8-bit PCMtodelta encoding asrequired. The Payloadtype field isusedtotellthedest- ination what encoding algorithm is used for the current packet, making it possible tovaryitondemand. An issue with providing feedback is that the RTCP reports are sent to all par- ticipants. For a multicast application with a large group, the bandwidth used by RTCP would quickly grow large. To prevent this from happening, RTCP senders scale down the rate of their reports to collectively consume nomore than, say, 5% of the media bandwidth', 'To do this, each participant needs to know the media bandwidth, which it learns from the sender, and the number of participants, which itestimates bylistening toother RTCP reports. RTCP also handles interstream synchronization. The problem is that different streams may use different clocks, with different granularities and different drift rates. RTCP canbeusedtokeep theminsync. Finally, RTCP provides a way for naming the various sources (e.g., in ASCII text). This information can be displayed on the receiver’s screen to indicate who istalking atthemoment. Moreinformation aboutRTP can befoundinPerkins (2003). PlayoutwithBuffering andJitter Control Once the media information reaches the receiver, it must be played out at the right time. In general, this will not be the time at which the RTP packet arrived at the receiver because packets will take slightly different amounts of time to transit the network. Even if the packets are injected with exactly the right intervals be- tween them at the sender, they will reach the receiver with different relative times. Thisvariation indelay iscalled jitter. Even asmall amountofpacket jitter can cause distracting media artifacts, such as jerky video frames andunintelligible audio,ifthemedia issimplyplayed outasitarrives. The solution to this problem is to buffer packets at the receiver before they are played outto reduce the jitter. As an example, inFig. 6-32we see astream of packets being delivered with a substantial amount of jitter. Packet 1 is sent from the server at t =0 sec and arrives at the client at t =1 sec. Packet 2 undergoes more delay and takes 2 sec to arrive. As the packets arrive, they are buffered on theclient machine. At t =10 sec, playback begins. At this time, packets 1 through 6 have been buffered so that they can be removed from the buffer at uniform intervals for smooth play. In the general case, it is not necessary to use uniform intervals be- cause theRTP timestamps tellwhenthemedia shouldbeplayed.

Smoothingtheoutputstreambybufferingpackets. Unfortunately, we can see that packet 8 has been delayed so much that it is not available when its play slot comes up. There are two options. Packet 8can be skipped and the player can move on to subsequent packets. Alternatively, play- back can stop until packet 8 arrives, creating an annoying gap in the music or movie. In a live media application like a voice-over-IP call, the packet will typi- cally be skipped. Live applications do not work well on hold. In a streaming me- dia application, the player might pause. This problem can be alleviated by delay- ingthe starting time even more, byusingalarger buffer. For astreaming audioor video player, buffers of about 10 seconds are often used to ensure that the player receives all of the packets (that are not dropped in the network) in time. For live applications likevideoconferencing, shortbuffers are needed forresponsiveness', 'Akey consideration for smooth playout is the playback point, or how long to wait at the receiver for media before playing it out. Deciding how long to wait depends on the jitter. The difference between a low-jitter and high-jitter con- nection is shown in Fig.6-33. The average delay may not differ greatly between the two, but if there is high jitter the playback point may need to be much further outtocapture 99%ofthepackets thanifthere islowjitter. To pick a good playback point, the application can measure the jitter by look- ing at the difference between the RTP timestamps and the arrival time. Each dif- ference gives a sample of the delay (plus an arbitrary, fixed offset). However, the delay can change over time due to other, competing traffic and changing routes. To accommodate this change, applications can adapt their playback point while they are running.However, if not done well, changing the playback pointcan pro- duce an observable glitch to the user. One way to avoid this problem for audio is to adapt the playback point between talkspurts, in the gaps in a conversation. No one will notice the difference between a short and slightly longer silence. RTP lets applications set the M marker bit to indicate the start of a new talkspurt for thispurpose. If the absolute delay until media is played out is too long, live applications willsuffer.

If this is not ac- ceptable, the only way to pull in the playback point is to reduce the jitter by using a better quality of service, for example, the expedited forwarding differentiated service. That is,abetter network isneeded. 6.5 THE INTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP UDP is a simple protocol and it has some very important uses, such as client- server interactions and multimedia, but for most Internet applications, reliable, se- quenced delivery is needed. UDP cannot provide this, so another protocol is re- quired. It is called TCP and is the main workhorse of the Internet. Let us now studyitindetail. 6.5.1 Introduction to TCP TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) was specifically designed to provide a reliable end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork. An internet- work differs from a single network because different parts may have wildly dif- ferent topologies, bandwidths, delays, packet sizes, and other parameters. TCP was designed to dynamically adapt to properties of the internetwork and to be robustinthefaceofmanykindsoffailures. TCP was formally defined in RFC 793 in September 1981. As time went on, many improvements have been made, and various errors and inconsistencies have been fixed. To give you a sense of the extent of TCP, the important RFCs are SEC', '6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 553 now RFC 793 plus: clarifications and bug fixes in RFC 1122; extensions for high-performance in RFC 1323; selective acknowledgements in RFC 2018; con- gestion control in RFC 2581; repurposing of header fields for quality of service in RFC 2873; improved retransmission timers in RFC 2988; and explicit congestion notification in RFC 3168. The full collection is even larger, which led to a guide tothemanyRFCs, publishedofcourse asanother RFC document, RFC 4614. Each machine supportingTCP has a TCP transport entity, either a library pro- cedure, a user process, or most commonly part of the kernel. In all cases, it man- ages TCP streams and interfaces to the IP layer. A TCP entity accepts user data streams from local processes, breaks them upinto pieces notexceeding 64KB (in practice, often 1460 data bytes in order to fit in a single Ethernet frame with the IP and TCP headers), and sends each piece as a separate IP datagram. When datagrams containing TCP data arrive at a machine, they are given to the TCP en- tity, which reconstructs the original byte streams. For simplicity, we will some- times use just ‘‘TCP’’ to mean the TCP transport entity (a piece of software) or the TCP protocol (a set of rules).From the context it willbe clear which is meant. For example, in ‘‘The user gives TCP the data,’’ the TCP transport entity is clear- lyintended. The IP layer gives noguarantee that datagrams will be delivered properly, nor any indication of how fast datagrams may be sent. It is up to TCP to send data- grams fast enough to make use of the capacity but not cause congestion, and to time out and retransmit any datagrams that are not delivered. Datagrams that do arrive may well do so in the wrong order; it is also up to TCP to reassemble them into messages in the proper sequence. In short, TCP must furnish good per- formance with the reliability that most applications want and that IP does not pro- vide. 6.5.2 The TCP Service Model TCP service is obtained by both the sender and the receiver creating end points, called sockets, as discussed in Sec. 6.1.3. Each socket has a socket num- ber (address) consisting of the IP address of the host and a 16-bit number local to that host, called a port. A port is the TCP name for a TSAP. For TCP service to be obtained, a connection must be explicitly established between a socket on one machine andasocket onanother machine. Thesocket calls are listed inFig. 6-5. A socket may be used for multiple connections at the same time. In other words, two or more connections may terminate at the same socket. Connections are identified bythe socket identifiers at both ends, that is, (socket1, socket2). No virtual circuit numbersorother identifiers are used. Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for standard services that can usually only be started by privileged users (e.g., root in UNIX systems). They are called well-known ports', 'For example, any process wishing to remotely retrieve mail from a host can connect to the destination host’s port 143 to contact its IMAP 554 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 daemon. The list of well-known ports is given at www.iana.org. Over 700 have been assigned. Afew ofthebetter-knownonesare listed inFig. 6-34.

Someassignedports. Other ports from 1024 through 49151 can be registered with IANA for use by unprivileged users, but applications can and do choose their own ports. For ex- ample, the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file-sharing application (unofficially) uses ports6881–6887,butmayrunonotherportsaswell. It would certainly be possible to have the FTP daemon attach itself to port 21 at boot time, the SSH daemon attach itself to port 22 at boot time, and so on. However, doing sowould clutter up memory with daemons that were idle most of the time. Instead, what is commonly done is to have a single daemon, called inetd (Internet daemon) in UNIX, attach itself to multiple ports and wait for the first incoming connection. When that occurs, inetd forks off a new process and executes the appropriate daemon in it, letting that daemon handle the request. In this way, the daemons other than inetd are only active when there is work for them to do. Inetd learns which ports it is to use from a configuration file. Conse- quently, the system administrator can set up the system to have permanent dae- monsonthebusiest ports(e.g., port80)andinetdontherest. All TCP connections are full duplex and point-to-point. Full duplex means that traffic can go in both directions at the same time. Point-to-point means that eachconnectionhasexactly twoendpoints. TCP doesnotsupportmulticastingor broadcasting. A TCP connection is a byte stream, not a message stream. Message bound- aries are not preserved end to end. For example, if the sending process does four 512-byte writes to a TCP stream, these data may be delivered to the receiving process as four512-bytechunks,two1024-bytechunks,one2048-bytechunk(see Fig.6-35), or some other way. There is no way for the receiver to detect the unit(s)inwhichthedata were written,nomatter howhardittries.

(b)The 2048bytesofdatadeliveredtotheapplicationinasingleREADcall. Files inUNIX have this property too. The reader of a file cannot tell whether the file was written a block at a time, a byte at a time, or all in one blow. As with aUNIX file, the TCP software has no idea of what the bytes mean and no interest infindingout. Abyteisjustabyte. When an application passes data to TCP, TCP may send it immediately or buffer it (in order to collect a larger amount to send at once), at its discretion. However, sometimes the application really wants the data to be sent immediately. For example, suppose a user of an interactive game wants to send a stream of updates. It is essential that the updates be sent immediately, not buffered until there is a collection of them', 'To force data out, TCP has the notion of a PUSH flag that is carried on packets. The original intent was to let applications tell TCP implementations via the PUSH flag not to delay the transmission. However, ap- plications cannot literally set the PUSH flag when they send data. Instead, dif- ferent operating systems have evolved different options to expedite transmission (e.g., TCP NODELAYinWindowsandLinux). For Internet archaeologists, we will also mention one interesting feature of TCP service that remains in the protocol but is rarely used: urgent data. When anapplication has highpriority data that shouldbe processed immediately, for ex- ample, if an interactive user hits the CTRL-C key to break off a remote computa- tion that has already begun, the sending application can put some control infor- mation in the data stream and give it to TCP along with the URGENT flag. This event causes TCP tostopaccumulatingdata and transmit everything it has forthat connectionimmediately. When the urgent data are received at the destination, the receiving application is interrupted (e.g., given a signal in UNIX terms) so it can stop whatever it was doing and read the data stream to find the urgent data. The end of the urgent data is marked so the application knows when it is over. The start of the urgent data is notmarked. Itisuptotheapplication tofigurethatout. Thisscheme provides acrude signaling mechanism andleaves everything else upto the application. However, while urgent data is potentially useful, it foundno compelling application early on and fell into disuse. Its use is now discouraged because of implementation differences, leaving applications to handle their own signaling. Perhaps future transport protocols willprovidebetter signaling. 556 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 6.5.3 The TCP Protocol In this section, we will give a general overview of the TCP protocol. In the nextone,wewillgoovertheprotocol header, field byfield. A key feature of TCP, and one that dominates the protocol design, is that every byte on a TCP connection has its own 32-bit sequence number. When the Internet began, the lines between routers were mostly 56-kbps leased lines, so a host blasting away at full speed took over 1 week to cycle through the sequence numbers. At modern network speeds, the sequence numbers can be consumed at an alarming rate, as we will see later. Separate 32-bit sequence numbers are car- ried on packets for the sliding window position in one direction and for acknowl- edgements inthereverse direction, asdiscussed below. The sending and receiving TCP entities exchange data in the form of seg- ments. A TCP segment consists of a fixed 20-byte header (plus an optional part) followed by zero or more data bytes. The TCP software decides how big seg- ments should be. It can accumulate data from several writes into one segment or can split data from one write over multiple segments. Two limits restrict the seg- ment size. First, each segment, including the TCP header, must fit in the 65,515- byte IP payload. Second, each link has an MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit)', 'Each segment must fit in the MTU at the sender and receiver sothat it can be sent and received in a single, unfragmented packet. In practice, the MTU is generally 1500 bytes (the Ethernet payload size) and thus defines the upper bound on seg- mentsize. However, it is still possible for IP packets carrying TCP segments to be frag- mented when passing over a network path for which some link has a small MTU. If this happens, it degrades performance and causes other problems (Kent and Mogul, 1987). Instead, modern TCP implementations perform path MTU discovery by using the technique outlined in RFC 1191 that we described in Sec. 5.5.5. Thistechnique uses ICMPerror messages tofindthesmallest MTUforany link on the path. TCP then adjusts the segment size downwards to avoid frag- mentation. The basic protocol used by TCP entities is the sliding window protocol with a dynamic window size. When a sender transmits a segment, it also starts a timer. When the segment arrives at the destination, the receiving TCP entity sends back asegment (withdata ifanyexist, andotherwise without)bearing anacknowledge- ment number equal to the next sequence number it expects to receive and the re- maining window size. If the sender’s timer goes off before the acknowledgement isreceived,thesender transmits thesegment again. Although this protocol sounds simple, there are many sometimes subtle ins and outs, which we will cover below. Segments can arrive out of order, so bytes 3072–4095can arrive butcannotbe acknowledgedbecausebytes 2048–3071have not turned up yet. Segments can also be delayed so long in transit that the sender times out and retransmits them. The retransmissions may include different byte SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 557 ranges than the original transmission, requiring careful administration to keep track of which bytes have been correctly received so far. However, since each byteinthestream hasitsownuniqueoffset, itcan bedone. TCP must be prepared to deal with these problems and solve them in an effi- cient way. A considerable amount of effort has gone into optimizing the per- formance ofTCP streams, eveninthe faceofnetwork problems. Anumber ofthe algorithms usedbymanyTCP implementations willbediscussed below. 6.5.4 The TCP Segment Header Figure 6-36showsthelayoutofaTCP segment. Every segment begins witha fixed-format, 20-byte header. The fixed header may be followed by header op- tions. After the options, if any, up to 65,535−20−20=65,495 data bytes may follow, where the first 20refer to the IP header andthe secondtothe TCP header. Segments without any data are legal and are commonly used for acknowledge- ments andcontrol messages. 32Bits Sourceport Destinationport Sequencenumber Acknowledgementnumber TCP C E U A P R S F header W C R C S S Y I Windowsize length R E G K H T N N Checksum Urgentpointer Options(0ormore32-bitwords) Data(optional) Figure6-36. TheTCPheader. Let us dissect the TCP header field byfield. The Source port and Destination port fields identify the local end points of the connection. A TCP port plus its host’s IP address forms a 48-bit unique end point. The source and destination end points together identify the connection', 'This connection identifier is called a 5 tuple because it consists of five pieces of information: the protocol (TCP), source IPandsource port,anddestination IPanddestination port. 558 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 The Sequence number and Acknowledgement number fields perform their usual functions. Note that the latter specifies the next in-order byte expected, not the last byte correctly received. It is a cumulative acknowledgement because it summarizes the received data with a single number. It does not go beyond lost data. Bothare 32bitsbecauseevery byteofdata isnumbered inaTCP stream. The TCP header length tells howmany 32-bit wordsare contained inthe TCP header. Thisinformation isneeded becausethe Optionsfield isofvariable length, so the header is, too. Technically, this field really indicates the start of the data within the segment, measured in 32-bit words, but that number is just the header lengthinwords,sotheeffect isthesame. Next comes a 4-bit field that is not used. The fact that these bits have remained unused for 30 years (as only 2 of the original reserved 6 bits have been reclaimed) is testimony to how well thought out TCP is. Lesser protocols would have needed these bitstofixbugsintheoriginal design. Now come eight 1-bit flags. CWR and ECE are used to signal congestion when ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) is used, as specified in RFC 3168. ECE is set to signal an ECN-Echo to a TCP sender to tell it to slow down when the TCP receiver gets a congestion indication from the network. CWR is set to signal Congestion Window Reduced from the TCP sender to the TCP receiver so that it knows the sender has slowed down and can stop sending the ECN-Echo. We discuss therole ofECNinTCP congestioncontrol inSec. 6.5.10. URG is set to 1 if the Urgent pointer is in use. The Urgent pointer is used to indicate a byte offset from the current sequence number at which urgent data are to be found. This facility is in lieu of interrupt messages. As we mentioned above, this facility is a bare-bones way of allowing the sender to signal the re- ceiver without getting TCP itself involved in the reason for the interrupt, but it is seldom used. The ACK bit is set to 1 to indicate that the Acknowledgement number is valid. This is the case for nearly all packets. If ACK is 0, the segment does not contain anacknowledgement,sotheAcknowledgement number field isignored. The PSH bit indicates PUSHed data. The receiver is hereby kindly requested to deliver the data tothe application uponarrival and notbuffer ituntila full buff- erhasbeenreceived(which itmightotherwise doforefficiency). The RST bit is used to abruptly reset a connection that has become confused due to a host crash or some other reason. It is also used to reject an invalid seg- ment or refuse an attempt to open a connection. In general, if you get a segment withtheRSTbiton,youhaveaproblem onyourhands. The SYN bit is used to establish connections. The connection request has SYN =1andACK =0toindicate thatthepiggybackacknowledgementfield isnot in use. The connection reply does bear an acknowledgement, however, so it has SYN =1 and ACK =1', 'In essence, the SYN bit is used to denote both CONNEC- TION REQUEST and CONNECTION ACCEPTED, with the ACK bit used to distin- guishbetween thosetwopossibilities. SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 559 The FIN bit is used torelease a connection. It specifies that the sender has no more data to transmit. However, after closing a connection, the closing process may continue to receive data indefinitely. Both SYN and FIN segments have se- quence numbersandare thusguaranteed tobeprocessed inthecorrect order. Flow control in TCP is handled using a variable-sized sliding window. The Window size field tells how many bytes may be sent starting at the byte acknow- ledged. A Window size field of 0is legal and says that the bytes uptoand includ- ing Acknowledgement number −1 have been received, but that the receiver has not had a chance to consume the data and would like no more data for the mo- ment, thank you. The receivercan later grant permission tosendbytransmittinga segment with the same Acknowledgement number and a nonzero Window size field. In the protocols of Chap. 3, acknowledgements of frames received and per- mission to send new frames were tied together. This was a consequence of a fixed window size for each protocol. In TCP, acknowledgements and permission to send additional data are completely decoupled. In effect, a receiver can say: ‘‘I have received bytes up through k but I do not want any more just now, thank you.’’ This decoupling (in fact, a variable-sized window) gives additional flexibil- ity. Wewillstudyitindetail below. A Checksum is also provided for extra reliability. It checksums the header, the data, and a conceptual pseudoheader in exactly the same way as UDP, except that the pseudoheader has the protocol number for TCP (6) and the checksum is mandatory. Please see Sec. 6.4.1fordetails. The Options field provides a way to add extra facilities not covered by the regular header. Many options have been defined and several are commonly used. The options are of variable length, fill a multiple of 32 bits by using padding with zeros, and may extend to 40 bytes to accommodate the longest TCP header that can be specified. Some options are carried when a connection is established to ne- gotiate or inform the other side of capabilities. Other options are carried on pack- ets during the lifetime of the connection. Each option has a Type-Length-Value encoding. A widely used option is the one that allows each host to specify the MSS (Maximum Segment Size) it is willing to accept. Using large segments is more efficient than using small ones because the 20-byte header can be amortized over more data, but small hosts may not be able to handle big segments. During con- nection setup, eachsidecan announceitsmaximum andsee its partner’s. Ifa host does not use this option, it defaults to a 536-byte payload. All Internet hosts are required to accept TCP segments of 536+20=556 bytes. The maximum seg- mentsize inthetwodirections need notbethesame. For lines with highbandwidth, high delay, or both, the 64-KB window corres- ponding toa 16-bit field is a problem', 'For example, onanOC-12 line (ofroughly 600 Mbps), it takes less than 1 msec to output a full 64-KB window. If the round-trip propagation delay is 50 msec (which is typical for a transcontinental 560 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 fiber), thesender willbeidlemore than98%ofthetimewaitingforacknowledge- ments. A larger window size would allow the sender to keep pumping data out. The window scale option allows the sender and receiver to negotiate a window scale factor at the start of aconnection. Bothsides use the scale factor toshift the Window size field up to 14 bits to the left, thus allowing windows of up to 230 bytes. MostTCP implementations supportthisoption. The timestamp option carries a timestamp sent by the sender and echoed by the receiver. It is included in every packet, once its use is established during con- nection setup, and used to compute round-trip time samples that are used to esti- mate when a packet has been lost. It is also used as a logical extension of the 32- bit sequence number. On a fast connection, the sequence number may wrap around quickly, leading to possible confusion between old and new data. The PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers) scheme discards ar- rivingsegments witholdtimestamps toprevent thisproblem. Finally, the SACK (Selective ACKnowledgement) option lets a receiver tell a sender the ranges of sequence numbers that it has received. It supplements the Acknowledgement number and is used after a packet has been lost but subsequent (orduplicate)data hasarrived. The newdata isnotreflected bytheAcknowledge- ment number field in the header because that field gives only the next in-order byte that is expected. With SACK, the sender is explicitly aware of what data the receiver has and hence can determine what data should be retransmitted. SACK is defined in RFC 2108 and RFC 2883 and is increasingly used. We describe the useofSACK alongwithcongestioncontrol inSec. 6.5.10. 6.5.5 TCP Connection Establishment Connectionsare established inTCP bymeans ofthe three-way handshake dis- cussed in Sec. 6.2.2. To establish a connection, one side, say, the server, pas- sively waits for an incoming connection by executing the LISTEN and ACCEPT primitivesinthatorder, either specifying aspecific source ornobodyinparticular. The other side, say, the client, executes a CONNECT primitive, specifying the IP address and port to which it wants to connect, the maximum TCP segment size it is willingto accept, and optionally some user data (e.g., a password). TheCON- NECT primitive sends a TCP segment with the SYN bit on and ACK bit off and waits foraresponse. When this segment arrives at the destination, the TCP entity there checks to see ifthere isa process thathasdoneaLISTEN ontheportgivenintheDestination portfield. Ifnot,itsendsareplywiththeRSTbitontoreject theconnection. If some process is listening to the port, that process is given the incoming TCP segment. It can either accept or reject the connection. If it accepts, an ac- knowledgement segment is sent back. The sequence of TCP segments sent in the normal case is shown in Fig.6-37(a). Note that a SYN segment consumes 1 byte ofsequence spacesothat itcan beacknowledgedunambiguously.

(a) TCP connection establishment in the normal case. (b) Simul- taneousconnectionestablishmentonbothsides. In the event that two hosts simultaneously attempt to establish a connection between the same two sockets, the sequence of events is as illustrated in Fig.6- 37(b). The result of these events is that just one connection is established, not two, because connections are identified by their end points. If the first setup re- sults in a connection identified by (x, y) and the second one does too, only one table entry ismade, namely, for(x,y). Recall that the initial sequence number chosen by each host should cycle slowly, rather than be a constant such as 0. This rule is to protect against delayed duplicatepackets, as we discussed in Sec 6.2.2. Originally this was accomplished withaclock-based scheme inwhichtheclock ticked every 4μsec. However, a vulnerability with implementing the three-way handshake is that the listening process mustremember itssequence number as soonit respondswith its own SYN segment. This means that a malicious sender can tie up resources on a host by sending a stream of SYN segments and never following through to com- plete the connection. This attack is called a SYN flood, and it crippled many Web servers inthe1990s. One way to defend against this attack is to use SYN cookies. Instead of remembering the sequence number, a host chooses a cryptographically generated sequence number, putsitonthe outgoingsegment, andforgets it. Ifthe three-way handshake completes, this sequence number (plus 1) will be returned to the host. It can then regenerate the correct sequence number by running the same crypto- graphic function, as longas theinputstothatfunction are known,forexample, the other host’s IP address andport, and a local secret. This procedure allows the host to check that an acknowledged sequence number is correct without having to 562 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 remember the sequence number separately. There are some caveats, such as the inability to handle TCP options, so SYN cookies may be used only when the host is subject to a SYN flood. However, they are an interesting twist on connection establishment. Formore information, see RFC 4987andLemon (2002). 6.5.6 TCP Connection Release AlthoughTCP connectionsare full duplex,tounderstandhow connections are released it is best tothink of them as a pair ofsimplex connections. Each simplex connectionisreleased independently ofitssibling. Torelease aconnection,either party can send a TCP segment with the FIN bit set, which means that it has no more data totransmit. When theFIN isacknowledged,that direction isshutdown for new data. Data may continue to flow indefinitely in the other direction, how- ever. When both directions have been shut down, the connection is released. Normally, four TCP segments are needed to release a connection: one FIN and oneACK foreach direction. However, it ispossible for the first ACK and the sec- ondFINtobecontained inthesame segment, reducing thetotalcounttothree', 'Justaswithtelephonecalls inwhichbothpeople saygoodbyeand hangupthe phone simultaneously, both ends of a TCP connection may send FIN segments at the same time. These are each acknowledged in the usual way, and the con- nection is shut down. There is, in fact, no essential difference between the two hostsreleasing sequentially orsimultaneously. Toavoidthetwo-army problem (discussed inSec. 6.2.3), timers are used. Ifa response to a FIN is not forthcoming within two maximum packet lifetimes, the sender of the FIN releases the connection. The other side will eventually notice that nobody seems to be listening to it anymore and will time out as well. While this solution is not perfect, given the fact that a perfect solution is theoretically impossible, itwillhave todo. Inpractice, problems rarely arise. 6.5.7 TCP Connection Management Modeling The stepsrequired toestablish andrelease connectionscan be represented ina finite state machine with the 11 states listed in Fig. 6-38. In each state, certain events are legal. When alegal event happens, some action may be taken. If some other event happens, anerror isreported. Each connection starts in the CLOSED state. It leaves that state when it does either a passive open (LISTEN) or an active open (CONNECT). If the other side does the opposite one, a connection is established and the state becomes ESTA- BLISHED. Connection release can be initiated by either side. When it is com- plete, thestate returns toCLOSED. The finite state machine itself is shown in Fig.6-39. The common case of a client actively connecting to a passive server is shown with heavy lines—solid for the client, dotted for the server. The lightface lines are unusual event sequences.

ThestatesusedintheTCPconnectionmanagementfinitestatemachine. Each line in Fig.6-39 is marked by an event/action pair. The event can either be a user-initiatedsystem call (CONNECT,LISTEN,SEND,orCLOSE), asegment arrival (SYN,FIN,ACK,orRST),or, inonecase, a timeout oftwice the maximum packet lifetime. The action is the sending of a control segment (SYN, FIN, or RST) or nothing,indicated by—. Comments are showninparentheses. One can best understand the diagram by first following the path of a client (the heavy solid line), then later following the path of a server (the heavy dashed line). When an application program on the client machine issues a CONNECT re- quest, the local TCP entity creates a connection record, marks it as being in the SYN SENT state, and shoots off a SYN segment. Note that many connections may be open (or being opened) at the same time on behalf of multiple applications, so the state is per connection and recorded in the connection record. When the SYN+ACK arrives, TCP sends the final ACK of the three-way handshake and switches intotheESTABLISHED state. Data can nowbesentandreceived. When an application is finished, it executes a CLOSE primitive, which causes the local TCP entity to send a FIN segment and wait for the corresponding ACK (dashed box marked ‘‘active close’’)', 'When the ACK arrives, a transition is made to the state FIN WAIT 2 and one direction of the connection is closed. When the other side closes, too, a FIN comes in, which is acknowledged. Now both sides are closed, but TCP waits a time equal to twice the maximum packet lifetime to guarantee that all packets from the connection have died off, just in case the ac- knowledgement was lost. When the timer goes off, TCP deletes the connection record. Now let us examine connection management from the server’s viewpoint. The server does a LISTEN and settles down to see who turns up. When a SYN 564 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 (Start) CONNECT/SYN(Step1ofthe3-wayhandshake) CLOSED CLOSE/– LISTEN/– CLOSE/– SYN/SYN+ACK (Step2 ofthe3-wayhandshake) LISTEN RST/– SEND/SYN SYN SYN RCVD SENT SYN/SYN+ACK (simultaneousopen) (Datatransferstate) ACK/– SYN+ACK/ACK ESTABLISHED (Step3ofthe3-wayhandshake) CLOSE/FIN CLOSE/FIN FIN/ACK (Activeclose) (Passive close) FIN/ACK FIN CLOSE CLOSING WAIT1 WAIT ACK/– ACK/– CLOSE/FIN FIN+ACK/ACK FIN TIME LAST WAIT2 WAIT ACK FIN/ACK (Timeout/) ACK/– CLOSED (Gobacktostart) Figure6-39.

When the server’s SYN is itself acknowledged, the three-way handshake is complete and theserver goestotheESTABLISHED state. Data transfer can nowoccur. When the client is done transmitting its data, it does aCLOSE, which causes a FIN to arrive at the server (dashed box marked ‘‘passive close’’). The server is then signaled. When it, too, does a CLOSE, a FIN is sent to the client. When the SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 565 client’s acknowledgement shows up, the server releases the connection and deletes theconnectionrecord. 6.5.8 TCP Sliding Window As mentioned earlier, window management in TCP decouples the issues of acknowledgement of the correct receipt of segments and receiver buffer alloca- tion. For example, suppose the receiver has a 4096-byte buffer, as shown in Fig.6-40. If the sender transmits a 2048-byte segment that is correctly received, the receiver will acknowledge the segment. However, since it now has only 2048 bytes of buffer space (until the application removes some data from the buffer), it willadvertise awindowof2048starting atthenextbyteexpected.

WindowmanagementinTCP. Now the sender transmits another 2048 bytes, which are acknowledged, but the advertised window is of size 0. The sender must stop until the application 566 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 process on the receiving host has removed some data from the buffer, at which time TCP can advertise alarger windowandmore data can besent. When the window is 0, the sender may not normally send segments, with two exceptions', 'First, urgent data may be sent, for example, to allow the user to kill theprocess runningontheremote machine. Second,thesender maysenda1-byte segment to force the receiver to reannounce the next byte expected and the win- dow size. This packet is called a window probe. The TCP standard explicitly providesthisoptiontoprevent deadlock ifawindowupdateever getslost. Senders are not required to transmit data as soon as they come in from the ap- plication. Neither are receivers required to send acknowledgements as soon as possible. For example, in Fig.6-40, when the first 2 KB of data came in, TCP, knowing that it had a 4-KB window, would have been completely correct in just buffering the data until another 2 KB came in, to be able to transmit a segment witha4-KBpayload. Thisfreedom can beusedtoimprove performance. Consider a connection to a remote terminal, for example using SSH or telnet, that reacts on every keystroke. In the worst case, whenever a character arrives at the sending TCP entity, TCP creates a 21-byte TCP segment, which it gives to IP to send as a 41-byte IP datagram. Atthe receivingside, TCP immediately sends a 40-byte acknowledgement (20 bytes of TCP header and 20 bytes of IP header). Later, when the remote terminal has read the byte, TCP sends a window update, moving the window 1 byte to the right.This packet is also 40 bytes.Finally, when the remote terminal has processed the character, it echoes the character for local display using a 41-byte packet. In all, 162 bytes of bandwidth are used and four segments are sent for each character typed. When bandwidth is scarce, this meth- odofdoingbusiness isnotdesirable. One approach that many TCP implementations use to optimize this situation is called delayed acknowledgements. The idea is to delay acknowledgements and window updates for up to 500 msec in the hope of acquiring some data on which to hitch a free ride. Assuming the terminal echoes within 500 msec, only one 41-byte packet now need be sent back by the remote side, cutting the packet countandbandwidth usage inhalf. Although delayed acknowledgements reduce the load placed on the network by the receiver, a sender that sends multiple short packets (e.g., 41-byte packets containing 1 byte of data) is still operating inefficiently. A way to reduce this usage is known as Nagle’s algorithm (Nagle, 1984). What Nagle suggested is simple: when data come into the sender in small pieces, just send the first piece and buffer all the rest until the first piece is acknowledged. Then send all the buffered data inoneTCP segment and start buffering again until the next segment is acknowledged. That is, only one short packet can be outstanding at any time. If many pieces of data are sent by the application in one round-trip time, Nagle’s algorithm will put the many pieces in one segment, greatly reducing the band- width used. The algorithm additionally says that a new segment should be sent if enoughdata have trickled intofillamaximum segment. SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 567 Nagle’s algorithm iswidely usedbyTCP implementations, butthere are times when it is better to disable it', 'In particular, in interactive games that are run over the Internet, the players typically want a rapid stream of short update packets. Gathering the updates to send them in bursts makes the game respond erratically, which makes for unhappy users. A more subtle problem is that Nagle’s algorithm can sometimes interact with delayed acknowledgements to cause a temporary deadlock: the receiverwaits fordata onwhich to piggyback an acknowledgement, and the sender waits on the acknowledgement to send more data. This interaction can delay the downloads of Web pages. Because of these problems, Nagle’s algo- rithm can be disabled (which is called the TCP NODELAY option). Mogul and Minshall (2001)discuss thisandothersolutions. Another problem that can degrade TCP performance is the silly window syn- drome (Clark, 1982). This problem occurs when data are passed to the sending TCP entity in large blocks, but an interactive application on the receiving side reads data only 1 byte at a time. To see the problem, look at Fig. 6-41. Initially, the TCP buffer onthe receivingside is full(i.e., it has awindowofsize 0)and the sender knows this. Then the interactive application reads one character from the TCP stream. This action makes the receiving TCP happy, so it sends a window update to the sender saying that it is all right to send 1 byte. The sender obliges and sends 1 byte. The buffer is now full, so the receiver acknowledges the 1-byte segment andsetsthewindowto0. Thisbehavior can goonforever. Clark’s solutionistoprevent the receiver fromsending awindowupdatefor1 byte. Instead, it is forced to wait until it has a decent amount of space available and advertise that instead. Specifically, the receiver should not send a window update until it can handle the maximum segment size it advertised when the con- nection was established or until its buffer is half empty, whichever is smaller. Furthermore, the sender can also help by not sending tiny segments. Instead, it should wait until it can send a full segment, or at least one containing half of the receiver’sbuffersize. Nagle’s algorithm and Clark’s solution to the silly window syndrome are complementary. Nagle was trying to solve the problem caused bythe sending ap- plication delivering data to TCP a byte at a time. Clark was trying to solve the problem of the receiving application sucking the data up from TCP a byte at a time. Both solutions are valid and can work together. The goal is for the sender nottosendsmall segments andthereceivernottoaskforthem. The receiving TCP can go further in improving performance than just doing window updates in large units. Like the sending TCP, it can also buffer data, soit can block a READ request from the application until it has a large chunk of data for it. Doing so reduces the number of calls to TCP (and the overhead). It also increases the response time, but for noninteractive applications like file transfer, efficiency maybemoreimportant thanresponsetimetoindividual requests. Another issue that the receiver must handle is that segments may arrive out of order. The receiver will buffer the data until it can be passed up to the application 568 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP', \"6 Receiver'sbufferisfull Applicationreads1byte Roomforonemorebyte Header Windowupdatesegmentsent Header Newbytearrives 1Byte Receiver'sbufferisfull Figure6-41. Sillywindowsyndrome. in order. Actually, nothing bad would happen if out-of-order segments were dis- carded, since they would eventually be retransmitted by the sender, but it would bewasteful. Acknowledgements can be sent only when all the data up to the byte acknow- ledged have been received. This is called a cumulative acknowledgement. If thereceivergetssegments 0,1,2,4,5,6,and7,it can acknowledgeeverything up to and including the last byte in segment 2. When the sender times out, it then retransmits segment 3. As the receiver has buffered segments 4 through 7, upon receiptofsegment 3itcan acknowledgeall bytesuptotheendofsegment 7. 6.5.9 TCP Timer Management TCP uses multiple timers (at least conceptually) todo its work. The most im- portant of these is the RTO (Retransmission TimeOut). When a segment is sent, a retransmission timer is started. If the segment is acknowledged before the timer expires, the timer isstopped. If, onthe other hand, the timer goes offbefore the acknowledgement comes in, the segment is retransmitted (and the timer os started again). The question thatarises is:howlongshouldthetimeout be? This problem is much more difficult in the transport layer than in data link protocols such as 802.11. In the latter case, the expected delay is measured in SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 569 microseconds and is highly predictable (i.e., has a low variance), so the timer can be set to go off just slightly after the acknowledgement is expected, as shown in Fig.6-42(a). Since acknowledgements are rarely delayed in the data link layer (due to lack of congestion), the absence of an acknowledgement at the expected time generally means either theframe ortheacknowledgementhasbeen lost. 0.3 T T T 1 2 0.2 0.1 0 0 10 20 Round-triptime(microseconds) (a) (b) ytilibaborP 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 ytilibaborP 30 40 50 0 10 20 30 40 50 Round-triptime(milliseconds) Figure6-42. (a) Probability density of acknowledgement arrival times in the datalinklayer.(b)ProbabilitydensityofacknowledgementarrivaltimesforTCP. TCP is faced with a radically different environment. The probability density function for the time it takes for a TCP acknowledgement to come back looks more like Fig.6-42(b) than Fig.6-42(a). It is larger and more variable. Deter- mining the round-trip time to the destination is tricky. Even when it is known, deciding on the timeout interval is also difficult. If the timeout is set too short, say, T in Fig.6-42(b), unnecessary retransmissions will occur, clogging the In- 1 ternet with useless packets. If it is set too long (e.g., T ), performance will suffer 2 due to the long retransmission delay whenever a packet is lost. Furthermore, the mean and variance of the acknowledgement arrival distribution can change rapid- lywithin afew secondsascongestionbuildsuporisresolved. The solution is to use a dynamic algorithm that constantly adapts the timeout interval, based on continuous measurements of network performance. The algo- rithm generally used byTCP is due toJacobson (1988)and works as follows. For each connection, TCP maintains a variable, SRTT (Smoothed Round-Trip Time), that is the best current estimate of the round-trip time to the destination in ques- tion\", 'When a segment is sent, a timer is started, both to see how long the ac- knowledgement takes and also to trigger a retransmission if it takes too long. If 570 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 the acknowledgement gets back before the timer expires, TCP measures how long theacknowledgementtook,say, R. ItthenupdatesSRTT accordingtotheformula SRTT =αSRTT +(1−α)R where α is a smoothing factor that determines how quickly the old values are for- gotten. Typically, α=7/8. This kind of formula is an EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)orlow-pass filterthatdiscards noiseinthesamples. Even given a good value of SRTT, choosing a suitable retransmission timeout is a nontrivial matter. Initialimplementations ofTCP used 2xRTT,butexperience showed that a constant value was too inflexible because it failed to respond when the variance went up. In particular, queueing models of random (i.e., Poisson) traffic predict that when the load approaches capacity, the delay becomes large and highly variable. This can lead tothe retransmission timer firing anda copyof the packet being retransmitted although the original packet is still transiting the network. It is all the more likely tohappen underconditionsofhighload, which is theworsttimeatwhichtosendadditionalpackets intothenetwork. To fix this problem, Jacobson proposed making the timeout value sensitive to the variance in round-trip times as well as the smoothed round-trip time. This change requires keeping track of another smoothed variable, RTTVAR (Round- TripTime VARiation) thatisupdatedusingtheformula RTTVAR =βRTTVAR +(1−β) |SRTT −R| This is an EWMA as before, and typically β=3/4. The retransmission timeout, RTO,issettobe RTO =SRTT +4×RTTVAR The choice of the factor 4 is somewhat arbitrary, but multiplication by 4 can be done with a single shift, and less than 1% of all packets come in more than four standard deviations late. NotethatRTTVARisnotexactly thesame asthestandard deviation (it is really the mean deviation), but it is close enough in practice. Jacobson’s paper is full of clever tricks to compute timeouts using only integer adds, subtracts, and shifts. This economy is not needed for modern hosts, but it has become part of the culture that allows TCP to run on all manner of devices, from supercomputers down to tiny devices. So far nobody has put it on an RFID chip,butsomeday? Whoknows. More details of how to compute this timeout, including initial settings of the variables, are given inRFC 2988. The retransmission timer isalso held toamini- mum of 1 second, regardless of the estimates. This is a conservative value chosen to prevent spurious retransmissions based on measurements (Allman and Paxson, 1999). One problem that occurs with gathering the samples, R, of the round-trip time is what to do when a segment times out and is sent again. When the acknowl- edgement comes in, it is unclear whether the acknowledgement refers to the first SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 571 transmission or a later one. Guessing wrong can seriously contaminate the re- transmission timeout. Phil Karn discovered this problem the hard way. Karn is an amateur radio enthusiast interested in transmitting TCP/IP packets by ham radio, a notoriously unreliable medium. He made a simple proposal: do not up- date estimates on any segments that have been retransmitted', 'Additionally, the timeout is doubled on each successive retransmission until the segments get through the first time. This fix is called Karn’s algorithm (Karn and Partridge, 1987). MostTCP implementations useit. The retransmission timer is not the only timer TCP uses. A second timer is the persistence timer. It is designed to prevent the following deadlock. The re- ceiver sends an acknowledgement with a window size of 0, telling the sender to wait. Later, the receiver updates the window, but the packet with the update is lost. Now the sender and the receiver are each waiting for the other to do some- thing. When the persistence timer goes off, the sender transmits a probe tothe re- ceiver. The response to the probe gives the window size. If it is still 0, the per- sistence timer is set again and the cycle repeats. If it is nonzero, data can now be sent. A third timer that some implementations use is the keepalive timer. When a connection has been idle for a long time, the keepalive timer may go off to cause oneside to checkwhetherthe other sideisstillthere. If it fails to respond, the con- nection is terminated. This feature is controversial because it adds overhead and may terminate an otherwise healthy connection due to a transient network parti- tion. The last timer used on each TCP connection is the one used in the TIME WAIT state while closing. It runs for twice the maximum packet lifetime to make surethatwhenaconnectionisclosed, allpackets created byithave diedoff. 6.5.10 TCP Congestion Control We have saved one of the key functions of TCP for last: congestion control. When the load offered to any network is more than it can handle, congestion builds up. The Internet is no exception. The network layer detects congestion when queues grow large at routers and tries to manage it, if only by dropping packets. It is up to the transport layer to receive congestion feedback from the network layer and slow down the rate of traffic that it is sending into the network. In the Internet, TCP plays the main role in controlling congestion, as well as the mainrole inreliable transport. That iswhyitissuchaspecial protocol. We covered the general situation of congestion control in Sec. 6.3. One key takeaway was that a transport protocol using an AIMD (Additive Increase Multi- plicative Decrease) control law in response to binary congestion signals from the network would converge to a fair and efficient bandwidth allocation. TCP con- gestion control is based on implementing this approach using a window and with packet loss as the binary signal. To do so, TCP maintains a congestion window 572 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 whose size isthe number ofbytes the sender may have inthe network at any time. The corresponding rate is the window size divided by the round-trip time of the connection. TCP adjuststhesize ofthewindowaccordingtotheAIMDrule. Recall that the congestion window is maintained in addition to the flow con- trol window, which specifies the number of bytes that the receiver can buffer', 'Both windows are tracked in parallel, and the number of bytes that may be sent is the smaller of the two windows. Thus, the effective window is the smaller of what the sender thinks isall right and what the receiver thinks is all right. It takes two to tango. TCP will stop sending data if either the congestion or the flow con- trol window is temporarily full. If the receiver says ‘‘send 64 KB’’ but the sender knows that bursts of more than 32 KB clog the network, it will send 32 KB. On the other hand, if the receiver says ‘‘send 64 KB’’ and the sender knows that bursts of up to 128 KB get through effortlessly, it will send the full 64 KB re- quested. The flow control window was described earlier, and in what follows we willonlydescribe thecongestionwindow. Modern congestion control was added to TCP largely through the efforts of Van Jacobson (1988). It is a fascinating story. Starting in 1986, the growing pop- ularity of the early Internet led to the first occurrence of what became known as a congestion collapse, a prolonged period during which goodput dropped precipi- tously(i.e., bymore than afactor of100)duetocongestionin the network. Jacob- son (and many others) set out to understand what was happening and remedy the situation. The high-level fix that Jacobson implemented was to approximate an AIMD congestionwindow.The interesting part, andmuchofthecomplexity ofTCP con- gestion control, ishowheaddedthistoanexisting implementation withoutchang- ing any of the message formats, which made it instantly deployable. To start, he observed that packet loss is a suitable signal of congestion. This signal comes a little late (as the network is already congested) but it is quite dependable. After all, it isdifficult tobuild arouter that does notdroppackets when it is overloaded. This fact is unlikely to change. Even when terabyte memories appear to buffer vast numbers of packets, we will probably have terabit/sec networks to fill up thosememories. However, usingpacket lossasacongestionsignaldepends ontransmission er- rors being relatively rare. This is not normally the case for wireless links such as 802.11,which iswhythey include their ownretransmission mechanism at the link layer. Because of wireless retransmissions, network layer packet loss due to transmission errors is normally masked on wireless networks. It is also rare on other linksbecausewires andoptical fibers typically havelowbit-error rates. All the Internet TCP algorithms assume that lost packets are caused by con- gestion and monitor timeouts and look for signs of trouble the way miners watch their canaries. Agoodretransmission timer isneeded todetect packet loss signals accurately and in a timely manner. We have already discussed how the TCP re- transmission timer includes estimates of the mean and variation in round-trip SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 573 times. Fixing thistimer, byincluding thevariation factor, wasanimportant step in Jacobson’s work. Given a good retransmission timeout, the TCP sender can track the outstanding number of bytes, which are loading the network. It simply looks at the difference between the sequence numbers that are transmitted and acknow- ledged. Now it seems that our task is easy', 'All we need to do is to track the conges- tion window, using sequence and acknowledgement numbers, and adjust the con- gestion window using an AIMD rule. As you might have expected, it is more complicated than that. A first consideration is that the way packets are sent into the network, even over short periods of time, must be matched to the network path. Otherwise the traffic will cause congestion. For example, consider a host with a congestion window of 64 KB attached to a 1-Gbps switched Ethernet. If the host sends the entire window at once, this burst of traffic may travel over a slow 1-Mbps ADSL line further along the path. The burst that took only half a millisecond on the 1-Gbps line will clog the 1-Mbps line for half a second, com- pletely disrupting protocols such as voice over IP. This behavior might be a good idea for a protocol designed to cause congestion, but not for a protocol to control it. However, it turns out that we can use small bursts of packets to our advan- tage. Fig. 6-43 shows what happens when a sender on a fast network (the 1-Gbps link) sends a small burst of four packets to a receiver on a slow network (the 1- Mbps link) that is the bottleneck or slowest part of the path. Initially the four packets travel over the link as quickly as they can be sent by the sender. At the router, they are queued while being sent because it takes longer to send a packet overtheslowlinkthantoreceivethe next packet over the fast link. Butthe queue is not large because only a small number of packets were sent at once. Note the increased length of the packets onthe slow link.

Sender Receiver 4:Ackspreserveslow 3:Receiveackspackets linktimingatsender Ackclock atslowlinkrate Figure6-43. Aburstofpacketsfromasenderandthereturningackclock. Eventually the packets get to the receiver, where they are acknowledged. The times for the acknowledgements reflect the times at which the packets arrived at the receiver after crossing the slow link. They are spread out compared to the original packets on the fast link. As these acknowledgements travel over the net- workandback tothesender theypreserve thistiming. 574 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 The key observation is this: the acknowledgements return to the sender at about the rate that packets can be sent over the slowest link in the path. This is precisely the rate that the sender wants to use. If it injects new packets into the network at thisrate, they willbe sent as fast as the slow linkpermits, butthey will not queue up and congest any router along the path. This timing is known as an ack clock. It is an essential part of TCP. By using an ack clock, TCP smoothes outtraffic andavoidsunnecessaryqueues atrouters', 'A second consideration is that the AIMD rule will take a very long time to reach a good operating point on fast networks if the congestion window is started from a small size. Consider a modest network path that can support 10 Mbps with an RTT of 100 msec. The appropriate congestion window is the bandwidth-delay product,which is1Mbitor100packets of1250bytes each.Ifthe congestionwin- dow starts at 1 packet and increases by 1 packet every RTT, it will be 100 RTTs or 10 seconds before the connection is running at about the right rate. That is a long time to wait just to get to the right speed for a transfer. We could reduce this startup time by starting with a larger initial window, say of 50 packets. But this window would be far too large for slow or short links. It would cause congestion ifusedallatonce, aswehavejustdescribed. Instead, the solution Jacobson chose to handle both of these considerations is a mix of linear and multiplicative increase. When a connection is established, the sender initializes the congestion window to a small initial value of at most four segments; the details are described in RFC 3390, and the use of four segments is an increase from an earlier initial value of one segment based on experience. The sender then sends the initial window. The packets will take a round-trip time to be acknowledged. For each segment that is acknowledged before the retransmis- sion timer goes off, the sender adds one segment’s worth of bytes to the conges- tion window. Plus, as that segment has been acknowledged, there is now one less segment in the network. The upshot is that every acknowledged segment allows two more segments to be sent. The congestion window is doubling every round- triptime. This algorithm is called slow start, but it is not slow at all—it is exponential growth—except in comparison to the previous algorithm that let an entire flow control window be sent all at once. Slow start is shown in Fig. 6-44. In the first round-trip time, the sender injects one packet into the network (and the receiver receives one packet). Two packets are sent in the next round-trip time, then four packets inthethirdround-triptime. Slow-start works well over a range of link speeds and round-trip times, and uses an ack clock to match the rate of sender transmissions to the network path. Take a look at the way acknowledgements return from the sender to the receiver in Fig. 6-44. When the sender gets an acknowledgement, it increases the conges- tion window by one and immediately sends two packets into the network. (One packet is the increase by one; the other packet is a replacement for the packet that has been acknowledged and left the network. At all times, the number of SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 575 TCPsender TCPreceiver cwnd=1 Data Acknowledgement 1RTT,1packet cwnd=2 1RTT,2packets cwnd=3 cwnd=4 1RTT,4packets cwnd=5 cwnd=6 cwnd=7 1RTT,4packets cwnd=8 (pipeisfull) Figure6-44. Slowstartfromaninitialcongestionwindowofonesegment. unacknowledgedpackets isgiven bythe congestionwindow.)However, these two packets will not necessarily arrive at the receiver as closely spaced as when they were sent', 'For example, suppose the sender is on a 100-Mbps Ethernet. Each packet of1250bytes takes 100μsec tosend.Sothedelay between thepackets can be as small as 100 μsec. The situation changes if these packets go across a 1- Mbps ADSL link anywhere along the path. It now takes 10msec tosend the same packet. This means that the minimum spacing between the two packets has grown bya factor of 100. Unless the packets have towait together inaqueue ona later link,thespacing willremain large. In Fig. 6-44, this effect is shown by enforcing a minimum spacing between data packets arriving at the receiver. The same spacing is kept when the receiver sends acknowledgements, and thus when the sender receives the acknowledge- ments. If the network path is slow, acknowledgements will come in slowly (after a delay of an RTT). If the network path is fast, acknowledgements will come in quickly (again, after the RTT). All the sender has todoisfollow the timing ofthe ack clock asitinjects newpackets, whichiswhatslowstart does. Because slow start causes exponential growth, eventually (and sooner rather than later) it will send too many packets into the network too quickly. When this happens, queues will build up in the network. When the queues are full, one or more packets will be lost. After this happens, the TCP sender will time out when an acknowledgement fails to arrive in time. There is evidence of slow start grow- ing toofast inFig. 6-44. After three RTTs, fourpackets are inthe network. These four packets take an entire RTT to arrive at the receiver. That is, a congestion window of four packets is the right size for this connection. However, as these packets are acknowledged, slow start continues to grow the congestion window, reaching eight packets in another RTT. Only four of these packets can reach the receiver in one RTT, no matter how many are sent. That is, the network pipe is full. Additional packets placed into the network by the sender will build up in 576 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 router queues, since they cannotbe delivered tothe receiver quickly enough.Con- gestion andpacket losswilloccur soon. Tokeepslow start undercontrol, the sender keeps athreshold forthe connect- ion called the slow start threshold. Initially this value is set arbitrarily high, to the size of the flow control window, so that it will not limit the connection. TCP keeps increasing the congestion window in slow start until a timeout occurs or the congestionwindowexceedsthethreshold (orthereceiver’swindowisfilled). Whenever a packet loss is detected, for example, by a timeout, the slow start threshold is set to be half of the congestion window and the entire process is restarted. The idea is that the current window is too large because it caused con- gestion previously that is only now detected by a timeout. Half of the window, which was used successfully at an earlier time, is probably a better estimate for a congestion window that is close to the path capacity but will not cause loss', 'In our example in Fig.6-44, growing the congestion window to eight packets may cause loss, while the congestion window of four packets in the previous RTT was the right value. The congestion window is then reset to its small initial value and slowstart resumes. Whenever the slow start threshold is crossed, TCP switches from slow start to additive increase. In this mode, the congestion window is increased by one seg- ment every round-trip time. Like slow start, this is usually implemented with an increase for every segment that is acknowledged, rather than an increase once per RTT. Call the congestion window cwnd and the maximum segment size MSS. A common approximation istoincrease cwndby(MSS ×MSS)/cwnd foreachofthe cwnd/MSS packets that may be acknowledged. This increase does not need to be fast. The whole idea is for a TCP connection to spend a lot of time with its con- gestion window close to the optimum value—not so small that throughput will be low,andnotsolarge thatcongestionwilloccur. Additiveincrease isshowninFig.6-45forthe same situation as slow start. At the end of every RTT, the sender’s congestion window has grown enough that it can inject an additional packet into the network. Compared to slow start, the linear rate of growth is much slower. It makes little difference for small conges- tion windows, as is the case here, but a large difference in the time taken to grow thecongestionwindowto100segments, forexample. There is something else that we can do to improve performance too. The defect in the scheme so far is waiting for a timeout. Timeouts are relatively long because they must be conservative. After a packet is lost, the receiver cannot acknowledge past it, so the acknowledgement number will stay fixed, and the sender will not be able to send any new packets into the network because its con- gestion window remains full. This condition can continue for a relatively long period untilthe timer fires andthe lost packet is retransmitted. At that stage, TCP slowstarts again. There is a quick way for the sender to recognize that one of its packets has been lost. As packets beyond the lost packet arrive at the receiver, they trigger SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 577 TCPsender TCPreceiver cwnd=1 Data Acknowledgement cwnd=2 1RTT,1packet 1RTT,2packets cwnd=3 1RTT,3packets cwnd=4 1RTT,4packets cwnd=5 1RTT,4packets (pipeisfull) Figure6-45. Additiveincreasefromaninitialcongestionwindowofonesegment. acknowledgements that return to the sender. These acknowledgements bear the same acknowledgement number. They are called duplicate acknowledgements. Each time the sender receives a duplicate acknowledgement, it is likely that an- other packet hasarrived atthereceiverandthelostpacket stillhasnotshownup. Because packets can take different paths through the network, they can arrive out of order. This will trigger duplicate acknowledgements even though no pack- ets have been lost. However, this is uncommon in the Internet much of the time. When there is reordering across multiple paths, the received packets are usually notreordered toomuch. Thus, TCP somewhat arbitrarily assumes that three dupli- cate acknowledgements imply that a packet has been lost. The identity of the lost packet can be inferred from the acknowledgement number as well. It is the very next packet in sequence', 'This packet can then be retransmitted right away, before theretransmission timeout fires. This heuristic is called fast retransmission. After it fires, the slow start threshold is still set to half the current congestion window, just as with a timeout. Slow start can be restarted by setting the congestion window to one packet. With this window size, a new packet will be sent after the one round-trip time that it takes to acknowledge the retransmitted packet along with all data that had been sentbefore thelosswasdetected. Anillustrationofthe congestionalgorithm we have built upso far is shown in Fig.6-46. This version of TCP is called TCP Tahoe after the 4.2BSD Tahoe re- lease in1988inwhich it was included. The maximum segment size here is 1KB. Initially, the congestion window was 64 KB, but a timeout occurred, so the thres- hold is set to 32 KB and the congestion window to 1 KB for transmission 0. The congestion window grows exponentially until it hits the threshold (32 KB). The 578 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 window is increased every time a new acknowledgement arrives rather than con- tinuously, which leads to the discrete staircase pattern.

This isdetected whenthree duplicateacknowledge- ments arrive. At that time, the lost packet is retransmitted, the threshold is set to half the current window (by now 40 KB, so half is 20 KB), and slow start is ini- tiated alloveragain. Restarting with acongestionwindowofonepacket takes one round-trip time for all of the previously transmitted data to leave the network and be acknowledged, including the retransmitted packet. The congestion window grows with slow start as it did previously, until it reaches the new threshold of 20 KB. At that time, the growth becomes linear again. It will continue in this fashion until another packet loss is detected via duplicate acknowledgements or a timeout (orthereceiver’swindowbecomes thelimit). TCP Tahoe (which included good retransmission timers) provided a working congestion control algorithm that solved the problem of congestion collapse. Jacobson realized that it is possible to do even better. At the time of the fast re- transmission, the connection is running with a congestion window that is too large, but it is still running with a working ack clock. Every time another dupli- cate acknowledgementarrives, it islikely that another packet has left the network. Using duplicate acknowledgements to count the packets in the network, makes it possible to let some packets exit the network and continue to send a new packet foreachadditionalduplicateacknowledgement. Fast recovery is the heuristic that implements this behavior. It is a temporary mode that aims to maintain the ack clock running with a congestion window that is the new threshold, or half the value of the congestion window at the time of the SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 579 fast retransmission', 'To do this, duplicate acknowledgements are counted (includ- ing the three that triggered fast retransmission) until the number of packets in the network has fallen to the new threshold. This takes about half a round-trip time. From then on, a new packet can be sent for each duplicate acknowledgement that is received. One round-trip time after the fast retransmission, the lost packet will have been acknowledged.Atthat time, the stream of duplicate acknowledgements will cease and fast recovery mode will be exited. The congestion window will be settothenewslowstart threshold andgrowsbylinear increase. The upshot of this heuristic is that TCP avoids slow start, except when the connection is first started and when a timeout occurs. The latter can still happen when more than one packet is lost and fast retransmission does not recover ade- quately. Instead of repeated slow starts, the congestion window of a running con- nection follows a sawtooth pattern of additive increase (by one segment every RTT) and multiplicative decrease (by half in one RTT). This is exactly the AIMD rule thatwesoughttoimplement. This sawtooth behavior is shown in Fig.6-47. It is produced by TCP Reno, named after the 4.3BSD Reno release in 1990 in which it was included. TCP Reno is essentially TCP Tahoe plus fast recovery. After an initial slow start, the congestion window climbs linearly until a packet loss is detected by duplicate ac- knowledgements. The lost packet is retransmitted and fast recovery is used to keep the ack clock running until the retransmission isacknowledged.At that time, the congestion window is resumed from the new slow start threshold, rather than from 1. This behavior continues indefinitely, and the connection spends most of the time with its congestion window close to the optimum value of the band- width-delay product.

FastrecoveryandthesawtoothpatternofTCPReno. TCP Reno with its mechanisms for adjusting the congestion window has formed the basis for TCP congestion control for more than two decades. Most of 580 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 the changes in the intervening years have adjusted these mechanisms in minor ways, for example, by changing the choices of the initial window and removing various ambiguities. Some improvements have been made for recovering from two or more losses in a window of packets. For example, the TCP NewReno ver- sionuses apartial advance ofthe acknowledgementnumber after a retransmission to find and repair another loss (Hoe, 1996), as described in RFC 3782. Since the mid-1990s,several variations have emerged thatfollow the principles we have de- scribed but use slightly different control laws. For example, Linux uses a variant called CUBIC TCP (Ha et al., 2008)and Windows includes a variant called Com- poundTCP (Tan etal., 2006). Two larger changes have also affected TCP implementations. First, much of the complexity of TCP comes from inferring from a stream of duplicate acknowl- edgements which packets have arrived and which packets have been lost', 'The cumulative acknowledgement number does not provide this information. A sim- ple fix is the use of SACK (Selective ACKnowledgements), which lists up to three ranges of bytes that have been received. With this information, the sender can more directly decide what packets to retransmit and track the packets in flight toimplement thecongestionwindow. When the sender and receiver set up a connection, they each send the SACK permitted TCP option to signal that they understand selective acknowledgements. Once SACK is enabled for a connection, it works as shown in Fig. 6-48. A re- ceiver uses the TCP Acknowledgement number field in the normal manner, as a cumulative acknowledgement of the highest in-order byte that has been received. When it receives packet 3 out of order (because packet 2 was lost), it sends a SACK option forthe received data alongwiththe (duplicate) cumulative acknowl- edgement for packet 1. The SACK option gives the byte ranges that have been re- ceived above the number given by the cumulative acknowledgement. The first range is the packet that triggered the duplicate acknowledgement. The next ranges, if present, are older blocks. Up to three ranges are commonly used. By the time packet 6 is received, two SACK byte ranges are used to indicate that packet 6 and packets 3 to 4 have been received, in addition to all packets up to packet 1. From the information in each SACK option that it receives, the sender can decide which packets to retransmit. In this case, retransmitting packets 2 and 5wouldbeagoodidea. SACK isstrictly advisory information. The actual detection of loss using dup- licate acknowledgements and adjustments to the congestion window proceed just as before. However, with SACK, TCP can recover more easily from situations in which multiple packets are lost at roughly the same time, since the TCP sender knows which packets have not been received. SACK is now widely deployed. It is described in RFC 2883, and TCP congestion control using SACK is described inRFC 3517. The second change is the use of ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) in addition to packet loss as a congestion signal. ECN is an IP layer mechanism to SEC. 6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: TCP 581 Retransmit2and5! Lostpackets 6 5 4 3 2 1 Sender Receiver ACK:1 ACK:1 ACK:1 ACK:1 SACK:3 SACK:3-4 SACK:6,3-4 Figure6-48. Selectiveacknowledgements. notify hosts of congestion that we described in Sec. 5.3.4. With it, the TCP re- ceiver canreceivecongestionsignalsfromIP. The useofECNisenabled foraTCP connectionwhenboththesender and re- ceiver indicate that they are capable of using ECN by setting the ECE and CWR bits during connection establishment. If ECN is used, each packet that carries a TCP segment is flagged in the IP header to show that it can carry an ECN signal. Routers that support ECN will set a congestion signal on packets that can carry ECN flags when congestion is approaching, instead of dropping those packets after congestionhasoccurred. The TCP receiver is informed if any packet that arrives carries an ECN con- gestion signal. The receiver then uses the ECE (ECN Echo) flag tosignal the TCP sender that its packets have experienced congestion', 'The sender tells the receiver thatithasheard thesignal byusingtheCWR(CongestionWindowReduced) flag. The TCP sender reacts to these congestion notifications in exactly the same way as it does to packet loss that is detected via duplicate acknowledgements. However, the situation is strictly better. Congestion has been detected and no packet was harmed in any way. ECN is described in RFC 3168. It requires both hostandrouter support,andisnotyetwidely usedontheInternet. For more information onthe complete set of congestion control behaviors that are implemented inTCP, see RFC 5681. 6.5.11 The Future of TCP As the workhorse of the Internet, TCP has been used for many applications and extended over time to give good performance over a wide range of networks. Many versions are deployed with slightly different implementations than the clas- sic algorithms we have described, especially forcongestioncontrol androbustness against attacks. Itislikely thatTCP willcontinue toevolve with the Internet. We willmentiontwoparticular issues. The first one is that TCP does not provide the transport semantics that all ap- plications want. For example, some applications want tosend messages orrecords whose boundaries need to be preserved. Other applications work with a group of 582 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 related conversations, such as a Web browser that transfers several objects from thesame server. Stillotherapplications want better control over the network paths that they use. TCP with its standard sockets interface does not meet these needs well. Essentially, the application has the burden of dealing with any problem not solved by TCP. This has led to proposals for new protocols that would provide a slightly different interface. Two examples are SCTP (Stream Control Transmis- sion Protocol), defined in RFC 4960, and SST (Structured Stream Transport) (Ford, 2007). However, whenever someone proposes changing something that has worked so well for so long, there is always a huge battle between the ‘‘Users are demanding more features’’and‘‘Ifitain’t broke, don’tfixit’’camps. The second issue is congestion control. You may have expected that this is a solved problem after our deliberations and the mechanisms that have been devel- oped over time. Not so. The form of TCP congestion control that we described, and which is widely used, is based on packet losses as a signal of congestion. When Padhye et al. (1998) modeled TCP throughput based on the sawtooth pat- tern, they found that the packet loss rate must drop off rapidly with increasing speed. Toreachathroughputof1Gbpswitharound-triptime of100msand1500 byte packets, one packet can be lost approximately every 10 minutes. That is a packet loss rate of 2×10 −8, which is incredibly small. It is too infrequent to serve as a good congestion signal, and any other source of loss (e.g., packet transmis- sionerror rates of10 −7)can easily dominate it,limitingthethroughput. This relationship has not been a problem in the past, but networks are getting faster and faster, leading many people to revisit congestion control. One possibil- ity is to use an alternate congestion control in which the signal is not packet loss at all. We gave several examples inSec. 6.2. The signal might beround-triptime, which grows when the network becomes congested, as is used by FAST TCP (Wei et al., 2006)', 'Other approaches are possible too, and time will tell which is thebest. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES Performance issues are veryimportant incomputer networks. When hundreds or thousands of computers are interconnected, complex interactions, with unfore- seen consequences, are common. Frequently, this complexity leads to poor per- formance and no one knows why. In the following sections, we will examine many issues related to network performance to see what kinds of problems exist andwhatcan bedoneaboutthem. Unfortunately, understanding network performance is more an art than a sci- ence. There is little underlying theory that is actually of any use in practice. The best we can doisgive some rules ofthumb gained fromhard experience and pres- ent examples taken from the real world. We have delayed thisdiscussion untilwe studied the transport layer because the performance that applications receive SEC. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES 583 depends on the combined performance of the transport, network and link layers, andtobeable touseTCP asanexample invarious places. Inthenextsections, wewilllookatsixaspects ofnetwork performance: 1. Performance problems. 2. Measuring network performance. 3. Hostdesignforfastnetworks. 4. Fast segment processing. 5. Header compression. 6. Protocols for‘‘longfat’’networks. These aspects consider network performance both at the host and across the net- work,andasnetworks are increased inspeed andsize. 6.6.1 Performance Problems in Computer Networks Some performance problems, such as congestion,are caused by temporary re- source overloads. If more traffic suddenly arrives at a router than the router can handle, congestionwill build upand performance will suffer. We studied conges- tionindetail inthisandtheprevious chapter. Performance also degrades when there is a structural resource imbalance. For example, if a gigabit communication line is attached to a low-end PC, the poor host will not be able to process the incoming packets fast enough and some will be lost. These packets will eventually be retransmitted, adding delay, wasting bandwidth, andgenerally reducing performance. Overloads can also be synchronously triggered. As an example, if a segment contains a badparameter (e.g., the portforwhich it isdestined), inmanycases the receiver will thoughtfully send back an error notification. Now consider what could happen if a bad segment is broadcast to 1000 machines: each one might send back an error message. The resulting broadcast storm could cripple the network. UDP suffered from this problem until the ICMP protocol was changed tocause hoststorefrain fromrespondingtoerrors inUDP segments sent tobroad- cast addresses. Wireless networks must be particularly careful toavoid unchecked broadcast responses because broadcast occurs naturally and the wireless band- widthislimited. Asecondexample ofsynchronousoverload iswhat happens after an electrical power failure. When the power comes back on, all the machines simultaneously start rebooting. A typical reboot sequence might require first going to some (DHCP) server to learn one’s true identity, and then to some file server to get a copy of the operating system. If hundreds of machines in a data center all do this atonce, theserver willprobably collapse undertheload. 584 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 Even in the absence of synchronous overloads and the presence of sufficient resources, poor performance can occur due to lack of system tuning', 'For ex- ample, if a machine has plenty of CPU power and memory but not enough of the memory has been allocated forbuffer space,flow control willslow downsegment reception and limit performance. This was a problem for many TCP connections as the Internet became faster but the default size of the flow control window stayed fixed at64KB. Another tuning issue is setting timeouts. When a segment is sent, a timer is set to guard against loss of the segment. If the timeout is set too short, unneces- sary retransmissions will occur, clogging the wires. If the timeout is set too long, unnecessary delays will occur after a segment is lost. Other tunable parameters include howlongtowait fordata onwhichtopiggybackbefore sending a separate acknowledgement,andhowmanyretransmissions tomake before givingup. Another performance problem that occurs with real-time applications like audio and video is jitter. Having enough bandwidth on average is not sufficient for good performance. Short transmission delays are also required. Consistently achieving short delays demands careful engineering of the load on the network, quality-of-servicesupportatthelinkandnetwork layers, orboth. 6.6.2 Network Performance Measurement When anetwork performs poorly,itsusers oftencomplain tothe folksrunning it, demanding improvements. To improve the performance, the operators must first determine exactly what isgoingon. Tofindoutwhat isreally happening, the operators must make measurements. In this section, we will look at network per- formance measurements. Much of the discussion below is based on the seminal workofMogul(1993). Measurements can be made in different ways and at many locations (both in the protocol stack andphysically). The most basic kindofmeasurement istostart a timer when beginning some activity and see how long that activity takes. For example, knowing how long it takes for a segment to be acknowledged is a key measurement. Other measurements are made with counters that record how often some event has happened (e.g., number oflost segments). Finally, oneisoftenin- terested in knowing the amount of something, such as the number of bytes proc- essed inacertain timeinterval. Measuring network performance and parameters has many potential pitfalls. We list a few of them here. Any systematic attempt to measure network per- formance shouldbecareful toavoidthese. Make Sure That the Sample Size IsLarge Enough Do not measure the time to send one segment, but repeat the measurement, say, one million times and take the average. Startup effects, such as the 802.16 NIC or cable modem getting a bandwidth reservation after an idle period, can SEC. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES 585 slow the first segment, and queueing introduces variability. Having a large sam- plewillreduce theuncertainty inthemeasured mean andstandard deviation. This uncertainty can becomputed usingstandard statistical formulas. Make Sure That the Samples Are Representative Ideally, the whole sequence of one million measurements should be repeated at different times of the day and the week to see the effect of different network conditions on the measured quantity. Measurements of congestion, for example, are of little use if they are made at a moment when there is nocongestion. Some- times the results may be counterintuitive at first, such as heavy congestion at 11 A.M.,and1P.M.,butnocongestionatnoon(when alltheusers are atlunch). With wireless networks, location is an important variable because of signal propagation', 'Even a measurement node placed close to a wireless client may not observe the same packets as the client due todifferences in the antennas. It is best to take measurements from the wireless client under study to see what it sees. Failingthat, itis possible touse techniques tocombine the wireless measurements taken at different vantage points to gain a more complete picture of what is going on(Mahajan etal., 2006). Caching CanWreak Havocwith Measurements Repeating a measurement many times willreturn an unexpectedly fast answer if the protocols use caching mechanisms. For instance, fetching a Web page or looking up a DNS name (to find the IP address) may involve a network exchange the first time, and then return the answer from a local cache without sending any packets over the network. The results from such a measurement are essentially worthless (unless youwanttomeasure cacheperformance). Buffering can have a similar effect. TCP/IP performance tests have been known to report that UDP can achieve a performance substantially higher than the network allows. How does this occur? A call to UDP normally returns control as soon as the message has been accepted by the kernel and added to the transmis- sion queue. If there is sufficient buffer space, timing 1000 UDP calls does not mean that all the data have been sent. Most ofthem may stillbe inthe kernel, but theperformance test program thinkstheyhave allbeen transmitted. Caution is advised to be absolutely sure that you understand how data can be cachedandbuffered aspartofanetwork operation. BeSure That Nothing Unexpected IsGoingOnduring Your Tests Making measurements at the same time that some user has decided to run a video conference over your network will often give different results than if there is no video conference. It is best to run tests on an idle network and create the 586 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 entire workload yourself. Even this approach has pitfalls, though. While you might think nobody will be using the network at 3 A.M., that might be when the automatic backup program begins copying all the disks to tape. Or, there might beheavy traffic foryourwonderfulWeb pages fromdistant timezones. Wireless networks are challenging in this respect because it is often not pos- sible to separate them from all sources of interference. Even if there are no other wireless networks sending traffic nearby, someone may microwave popcorn and inadvertently cause interference that degrades 802.11 performance. For these rea- sons, it is a good practice to monitor the overall network activity so that you can atleast realize whensomething unexpected doeshappen. BeCareful When Using aCoarse-Grained Clock Computer clocks function by incrementing some counter at regular intervals. For example, a millisecond timer adds 1 to a counter every 1 msec. Using such a timer tomeasure anevent thattakes lessthan1msec ispossible butrequires some care. Some computers have more accurate clocks, of course, but there are always shorter events to measure too. Note that clocks are not always as accurate as the precision withwhichthetimeisreturned whentheyare read', 'To measure the time to make a TCP connection, for example, the clock (say, in milliseconds) should be read out when the transport layer code is entered and again when it is exited. If the true connection setup time is 300 μsec, the dif- ference between the two readings will be either 0 or 1, both wrong. However, if the measurement is repeated one million times and the total of all measurements is added up and divided by one million, the mean time will be accurate to better than1μsec. BeCareful aboutExtrapolating the Results Suppose that you make measurements with simulated network loads running from 0 (idle) to 0.4 (40% of capacity). For example, the response time to send a voice-over-IP packet over an 802.11 network might be as shown by the data points and solid line through them in Fig.6-49. It may be tempting to extrapolate linearly, as shown by the dotted line. However, many queueing results involve a factor of 1/(1−ρ), where ρ is the load, so the true values may look more like the dashed line, which rises much faster than linearly when the load gets high. That is,beware contention effects thatbecome muchmore pronouncedathighload. 6.6.3 Host Design for Fast Networks Measuring andtinkering can improve performance considerably, butthey can- not substitute for good design in the first place. A poorly designed network can beimproved onlysomuch. Beyondthat, ithastoberedesigned fromscratch.

In this section, we will present some rules of thumb for software imple- mentation of network protocols on hosts. Surprisingly, experience shows that this is often a performance bottleneck on otherwise fast networks, for two reasons. First, NICs (Network Interface Cards) and routers have already been engineered (with hardware support) to run at ‘‘wire speed.’’ This means that they can process packets as quickly as the packets can possibly arrive on the link. Second, the relevant performance is that which applications obtain. It is not the link capacity, butthethroughputanddelay after network andtransport processing. Reducing software overheads improves performance byincreasing throughput and decreasing delay. It can also reduce the energy that is spent on networking, which is an important consideration for mobile computers. Most of these ideas have been common knowledge to network designers for years. They were first stated explicitly by Mogul (1993); our treatment largely follows his. Another relevant source isMetcalfe (1993). HostSpeed IsMore Important ThanNetwork Speed Long experience has shown that in nearly all fast networks, operating system and protocol overhead dominate actual time on the wire. For example, in theory, the minimum RPC time on a 1-Gbps Ethernet is 1 μsec, corresponding to a mini- mum (512-byte) request followed by a minimum (512-byte) reply. In practice, overcoming the software overhead and getting the RPC time anywhere near there isasubstantial achievement. Itrarely happens inpractice. 588 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP', '6 Similarly, the biggest problem in running at 1 Gbps is often getting the bits from the user’s buffer out onto the network fast enough and having the receiving host process them as fast as they come in. If youdouble the host (CPU and mem- ory) speed, you often can come close to doubling the throughput. Doubling the network capacity hasnoeffect ifthebottleneckisinthehosts. Reduce Packet Count toReduce Overhead Each segment has a certain amount of overhead (e.g., the header) as well as data (e.g., the payload). Bandwidth is required for bothcomponents. Processing is also required for both components (e.g., header processing and doing the check- sum). When 1 million bytes are being sent, the data cost is the same no matter what the segment size is. However, using 128-byte segments means 32 times as much per-segment overhead as using 4-KB segments. The bandwidth and proc- essingoverheads addupfast toreduce throughput. Per-packet overhead in the lower layers amplifies this effect. Each arriving packet causes a fresh interrupt if the host is keeping up. On a modern pipelined processor, each interrupt breaks the CPU pipeline, interferes with the cache, re- quires a change to the memory management context, voids the branch prediction table, and forces a substantial number of CPU registers tobe saved. An n-fold re- duction in segments sent thus reduces the interrupt and packet overhead by a fac- torofn. You might say that both people and computers are poor at multitasking. This observation underliesthe desire tosend MTU packets thatare aslarge aswillpass alongthenetwork path withoutfragmentation. Mechanisms such as Nagle’s algo- rithmandClark’s solutionare alsoattempts toavoidsendingsmall packets. Minimize DataTouching The most straightforward way to implement a layered protocol stack is with one module for each layer. Unfortunately, this leads to copying (or at least ac- cessing the data on multiple passes) as each layer does its own work. For ex- ample, after apacket isreceivedbythe NIC,itistypically copied toakernel buff- er. Fromthere, itiscopied toanetwork layer buffer fornetwork layer processing, then toa transport layer buffer for transport layer processing, andfinally tothe re- ceiving application process. It is not unusual for an incoming packet to be copied three orfourtimes before thesegment enclosed initisdelivered. All this copying can greatly degrade performance because memory operations are an order of magnitude slower than register–register instructions. For example, if 20% of the instructions actually go to memory (i.e., are cache misses), which is likely when touching incoming packets, the average instruction execution time is slowed down by a factor of 2.8 (0.8×1+0.2×10). Hardware assistance will not helphere. The problem istoomuchcopyingbytheoperating system. SEC. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES 589 A clever operating system will minimize copying by combining the proc- essing of multiple layers. For example, TCP and IP are usually implemented to- gether (as ‘‘TCP/IP’’) so that it is not necessary to copy the payload of the packet as processing switches from network to transport layer. Another common trick is to perform multiple operations within a layer in a single pass over the data. For example, checksums are often computed while copyingthe data (when ithastobe copied) andthenewlycomputed checksum isappended totheend', 'Minimize Context Switches A related rule is that context switches (e.g., from kernel mode to user mode) are deadly. They have the bad properties of interrupts and copying combined. This cost is why transport protocols are often implemented in the kernel. Like reducing packet count, context switches can be reduced by having the library pro- cedure that sends data do internal buffering until it has a substantial amount of them. Similarly, on the receiving side, small incoming segments should be col- lected together and passed to the user in one fell swoop instead of individually, to minimize context switches. In the best case, an incoming packet causes a context switch from the current user to the kernel, and then a switch to the receiving process to give it the newly arrived data. Unfortunately, with some operating systems, additional context switches happen. For example, if the network manager runs as a special process in user space, a packet arrival is likely to cause a context switch from the current user to the kernel, then another one from the kernel to the network manager, fol- lowed byanother oneback to the kernel, and finally one from the kernel tothe re- ceiving process. This sequence is shown in Fig.6-50. All these context switches oneachpacket are wasteful ofCPUtime andcan have a devastating effect onnet- workperformance.

When a network is congested, packets are lost, bandwidth is wasted, useless delays are introduced, and more. All of these costs are unnecessary, and recovering from congestion takes time and patience. Not having it occur in the first place is better. Congestion avoidance is like getting your DTP vaccination: it hurts a little at the time you get it, but it prevents some- thingthatwouldhurtalotmoreinthefuture. Avoid Timeouts Timers are necessaryinnetworks, butthey shouldbeused sparingly andtime- outs should be minimized. When a timer goes off, some action is generally re- peated. If it is truly necessary to repeat the action, so be it, but repeating it unnecessarilyiswasteful. The way to avoid extra work is to be careful that timers are set a little bit on the conservative side. A timer that takes too long to expire adds a small amount ofextra delay tooneconnectioninthe (unlikely) event ofa segment being lost. A timer that goes off when it should not have uses up host resources, wastes band- width,andputsextra loadonperhaps dozens ofrouters fornogoodreason. 6.6.4 Fast Segment Processing Now that we have covered general rules, we will look at some specific meth- ods for speeding up segment processing. For more information, see Clark et al. (1989),andChase etal.(2001). Segment processing overhead has twocomponents:overhead per segment and overhead per byte. Both must be attacked. The key to fast segment processing is to separate out the normal, successful case (one-way data transfer) and handle it specially', 'Many protocols tend to emphasize what to do when something goes wrong(e.g., a packet getting lost), but tomake the protocols run fast, the designer should aim to minimize processing time when everything goes right. Minimizing processing time whenanerror occurs issecondary. Although a sequence of special segments is needed to get into the ESTAB- LISHED state, once there, segment processing is straightforward until one side starts to close the connection. Let us begin by examining the sending side in the ESTABLISHED state when there are data to be transmitted. For the sake of clar- ity, we assume here that the transport entity is in the kernel, although the same ideas apply if it is a user-space process or a library inside the sending process. In Fig.6-51, the sending process traps into the kernel to dotheSEND. The first thing the transport entity does is test to see if this is the normal case: the state is ESTA- BLISHED, neither side is trying to close the connection, a regular (i.e., not an SEC. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES 591 out-of-band) full segment is being sent, and enough window space is available at thereceiver. Ifallconditionsare met, nofurther tests are needed and the fast path through the sending transport entity can be taken. Typically, this path is taken mostofthetime. Sending Receivingprocess S S process Segmentpassedtothereceivingprocess Trapintothekerneltosendsegment Test Test Network Figure6-51. The fast pathfrom sender toreceiver isshownwith a heavy line. Theprocessingstepsonthispathareshaded. In the usual case, the headers of consecutive data segments are almost the same. To take advantage of this fact, a prototype header is stored within the tran- sport entity. At the start of the fast path, it is copied as fast as possible to a scratch buffer, word by word. Those fields that change from segment to segment are overwritteninthebuffer. Frequently, these fields are easily derived fromstate variables, such as the next sequence number. Apointer tothe full segment header plus a pointer to the user data are then passed to the network layer. Here, the same strategy can be followed (not shown in Fig. 6-51). Finally, the network layer givestheresultingpacket tothedata linklayer fortransmission. Asanexample ofhowthisprinciple worksinpractice, letusconsider TCP/IP. Fig.6-52(a) shows the TCP header. The fields that are the same between consec- utivesegments ona one-way flow are shaded. All the sending transport entityhas to do is copy the five words from the prototype header into the output buffer, fill inthe next sequence number (by copying it from a word in memory), compute the checksum, and increment the sequence number in memory. It can then hand the header and data to a special IP procedure for sending a regular, maximum seg- ment. IP then copies its five-word prototype header [see Fig. 6-52(b)] into the buffer, fills in the Identification field, and computes its checksum. The packet is nowready fortransmission. Now let us look at fast path processing on the receiving side of Fig.6-51. Step 1 is locating the connection record for the incoming segment. For TCP, the 592 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 Sourceport Destination port VER', 'IHL Sequencenumber Identification Fragmentoffset Acknowledgementnumber Headerchecksum Len Unused Windowsize Checksum Urgentpointer (a) (b) D iff.

Inbothcases, theyare takenfrom theprototypewithoutchange. connection record can be stored in a hash table for which some simple function of the two IP addresses and two ports is the key. Once the connection record has been located, both addresses and both ports must be compared to verify that the correct record hasbeenfound. An optimization that often speeds up connection record lookup even more is to maintain a pointer to the last one used and try that one first. Clark et al. (1989) tried thisandobserved ahitrate exceeding90%. The segment is checked to see if it is a normal one: the state is ESTAB- LISHED, neither side is trying to close the connection, the segment is a full one, nospecial flags are set, and the sequence number is the one expected. These tests take just a handful of instructions. If all conditions are met, a special fast path TCP procedure iscalled. The fast path updates the connection record and copies the data to the user. While it is copying,it also computes the checksum, eliminating an extra pass over the data. If the checksum is correct, the connection record is updated and an ac- knowledgementissent back. The general scheme offirst makingaquickcheck to see if the header is what is expected and then having a special procedure handle that case is called header prediction. Many TCP implementations use it. When thisoptimization and all the other ones discussed inthis chapter are used together, it is possible to get TCP to run at 90% of the speed of a local memory-to-memory copy,assumingthenetwork itself isfastenough. Two other areas where major performance gains are possible are buffer man- agement and timer management. The issue in buffer management is avoiding unnecessary copying, as mentioned above. Timer management is important be- cause nearly all timers set do not expire. They are set to guard against segment loss, butmost segments and their acknowledgements arrive correctly. Hence, it is important tooptimize timer management forthecase oftimers rarely expiring. A common scheme is to use a linked list of timer events sorted by expiration time. The head entry contains a countertelling how many ticks away from expiry it is. Each successive entry contains a counter telling how many ticks after the SEC. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES 593 previous entry it is. Thus, if timers expire in 3, 10, and 12 ticks, respectively, the three countersare 3,7,and2,respectively. At every clock tick, the counter in the head entry is decremented. When it hits zero, its event isprocessed andthe next item onthe list becomes the head. Its counter does not have to be changed. This way, inserting and deleting timers are expensive operations, withexecution times proportionaltothelengthofthelist. A much more efficient approach can be used if the maximum timer interval is bounded and known in advance. Here, an array called a timing wheel can be used, as shown in Fig.6-53. Each slot corresponds to one clock tick. The current time shown is T =4', 'Timers are scheduled to expire at 3, 10, and 12 ticks from now. If a new timer suddenly is set to expire in seven ticks, an entry is just made in slot11. Similarly, ifthe timer set forT +10has tobe canceled, the list starting in slot 14 has to be searched and the required entry removed. Note that the array ofFig.6-53cannotaccommodatetimers beyondT +15.

When the clock ticks, the current time pointer is advanced by one slot (circu- larly). If the entry now pointed to is nonzero, all of its timers are processed. Manyvariations onthebasic idea are discussed byVarghese andLauck (1987). 6.6.5 Header Compression We have been looking at fast networks for too long. There is more out there. Let us now consider performance on wireless and other networks in which band- width is limited. Reducing software overhead can help mobile computers run 594 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 more efficiently, but it does nothing to improve performance when the network linksare thebottleneck. To use bandwidth well, protocol headers and payloads should be carried with the minimum of bits. For payloads, this means using compact encodings of infor- mation, such as images that are inJPEG format rather than a bitmap, or document formats such as PDF that include compression. It also means application-level cachingmechanisms, suchasWebcachesthatreduce transfers inthefirst place. What about for protocol headers? At the link layer, headers for wireless net- worksare typically compact because they were designed withscarce bandwidth in mind. For example, 802.16 headers have short connection identifiers instead of longer addresses. However, higher layer protocols such as IP, TCP and UDP come in one version for all link layers, and they are not designed with compact headers. In fact, streamlined processing to reduce software overhead often leads to headers that are not as compact as they could otherwise be (e.g., IPv6 has a more looselypacked headers thanIPv4). The higher-layer headers can be a significant performance hit. Consider, for example, voice-over-IP data that is being carried with the combination of IP, UDP, and RTP. These protocols require 40 bytes of header (20 for IPv4, 8 for UDP, and12forRTP). With IPv6 the situation iseven worse: 60bytes, including the 40-byte IPv6 header. The headers can wind up as the majority of the trans- mitteddata andconsume morethanhalfthebandwidth. Header compression is used to reduce the bandwidth taken over links by higher-layer protocol headers. Specially designed schemes are used instead of general purpose methods. This is because headers are short, so they do not compress well individually, and decompression requires all prior data to be re- ceived. Thiswillnotbethecase ifapacket islost. Header compression obtains large gains by using knowledge of the protocol format. One of the first schemes was designed by Van Jacobson (1990) for com- pressing TCP/IP headers over slow serial links. It is able to compress a typical TCP/IP header of 40 bytes down to an average of 3 bytes', 'The trick to this meth- od is hinted at in Fig.6-52. Many of the header fields do not change from packet to packet. There is no need, for example, to send the same IP TTL or the same TCP port numbers in each and every packet. They can be omitted on the sending sideofthelinkandfilledinonthereceivingside. Similarly, other fields change in a predictable manner. For example, barring loss, the TCP sequence number advances with the data. In these cases, the re- ceiver can predict the likely value. The actual number only needs to be carried when it differs from what is expected. Even then, it may be carried as a small change from the previous value, as when the acknowledgement number increases whennewdata isreceivedinthereverse direction. With header compression, it ispossible tohave simple headers inhigher-layer protocols and compact encodings over low bandwidth links. ROHC (RObust Header Compression) is a modern version of header compression that is defined SEC. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES 595 as a framework in RFC 5795. It is designed to tolerate the loss that can occur on wireless links. There is a profile for each set of protocols to be compressed, such as IP/UDP/RTP. Compressed headers are carried by referring to a context, which is essentially a connection; header fields may easily be predicted for packets of the same connection, but not for packets of different connections. In typical oper- ation, ROHCreduces IP/UDP/RTP headers from40bytesto1to3bytes. While header compression is mainly targeted at reducing bandwidth needs, it can also be useful for reducing delay. Delay is comprised of propagation delay, which is fixed given a network path, and transmission delay, which depends on the bandwidth and amount of data tobe sent. For example, a 1-Mbps linksends 1 bitin1μsec. Inthecase ofmedia overwireless networks, the network isrelative- lyslowsotransmission delay maybeanimportant factor inoverall delay andcon- sistently lowdelay isimportant forqualityofservice. Header compression can help by reducing the amount of data that is sent, and hence reducing transmission delay. The same effect can be achieved by sending smaller packets. This will trade increased software overhead for decreased trans- mission delay. Note that another potential source of delay is queueing delay toac- cess the wireless link. Thiscan also besignificant because wireless links are often heavily used as the limited resource in a network. In this case, the wireless link musthave quality-of-servicemechanisms that give lowdelay toreal-time packets. Header compression alone isnotsufficient. 6.6.6 Protocols for Long Fat Networks Since the 1990s, there have been gigabit networks that transmit data over large distances. Because of the combination of a fast network, or ‘‘fat pipe,’’ and long delay, these networks are called long fat networks. When these networks arose, people’s first reaction was to use the existing protocols on them, but vari- ous problems quickly arose. In this section, we will discuss some of the problems withscaling upthespeed anddelay ofnetwork protocols. The first problem is that many protocols use 32-bit sequence numbers. When the Internet began, the lines between routers were mostly 56-kbps leased lines, so a host blasting away at full speed took over 1 week to cycle through the sequence numbers', 'Tothe TCP designers, 232 was a pretty decentapproximation ofinfinity because there was little danger of old packets still being around a week after they were transmitted. With 10-Mbps Ethernet, the wrap time became 57 minutes, much shorter, butstillmanageable. With a 1-Gbps Ethernet pouringdata out onto the Internet, the wrap time is about 34 seconds, well under the 120-sec maximum packet lifetime on the Internet. All of a sudden, 232 is not nearly as good an approximation toinfinity since a fast sender can cycle through the sequence space while oldpackets stillexist. The problem is that many protocol designers simply assumed, without stating it, that the time required to use upthe entire sequence space would greatly exceed 596 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 the maximum packet lifetime. Consequently, there was no need to even worry about the problem of old duplicates still existing when the sequence numbers wrapped around. Atgigabit speeds, that unstated assumption fails. Fortunately, it proved possible to extend the effective sequence number by treating the time- stamp that can be carried as an option in the TCP header of each packet as the high-order bits. This mechanism is called PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers) andisdescribed inRFC 1323. A second problem is that the size of the flow control window must be greatly increased. Consider, for example, sending a 64-KB burst of data from San Diego to Boston in order to fill the receiver’s 64-KB buffer. Suppose that the link is 1 Gbps and the one-way speed-of-light-in-fiber delay is 20 msec. Initially, at t =0, the pipe is empty, as illustrated in Fig. 6-54(a). Only 500 μsec later, in Fig.6- 54(b), all the segments are out on the fiber. The lead segment will now be some- where in the vicinity of Brawley, still deep in Southern California. However, the transmittermuststopuntilitgetsawindowupdate. Data (a) (b) Acknowledgements (c) (d) Figure6-54. Thestateoftransmitting1MbitfromSanDiegotoBoston.

Finally, 40 msec after starting, the first acknowledgement gets SEC. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES 597 back tothesender andthesecondburstcanbetransmitted. Since the transmission line was used for 1.25 msec out of 100, the efficiency is about 1.25%. This situa- tionistypical ofanolderprotocols runningovergigabitlines. A useful quantityto keep in mind when analyzing network performance is the bandwidth-delay product. It is obtained by multiplying the bandwidth (in bits/sec) by the round-trip delay time (in sec). The product is the capacity of the pipefromthesender tothereceiverandback (inbits). For the example of Fig. 6-54, the bandwidth-delay product is 40 million bits. In other words, the sender would have to transmit a burst of 40 million bits to be able to keep going full speed until the first acknowledgement came back. It takes this many bits to fill the pipe (in both directions). This is why a burst of half a millionbitsonlyachieves a1.25%efficiency: itisonly1.25%ofthepipe’scapac- ity. The conclusion that can be drawn here is that for good performance, the re- ceiver’s window must be at least as large as the bandwidth-delay product, and preferably somewhat larger since the receiver may not respond instantly', 'For a transcontinental gigabitline, atleast 5MBare required. Athird and related problem isthat simple retransmission schemes, such as the go-back-n protocol, perform poorlyonlineswithalarge bandwidth-delay product. Consider, the 1-Gbps transcontinental link with a round-trip transmission time of 40 msec. A sender can transmit 5 MB in one round trip. If an error is detected, it will be 40msec before the sender is told aboutit. If go-back-n is used, the sender will have toretransmit not justthe badpacket, butalso the 5MB worth ofpackets that came afterward. Clearly, this is a massive waste of resources. More complex protocols suchasselective-repeat are needed. A fourth problem is that gigabit lines are fundamentally different from mega- bit lines in that long gigabit lines are delay limited rather than bandwidth limited. In Fig. 6-55 we show the time it takes totransfer a 1-Mbit file 4000 km at various transmission speeds. At speeds up to 1 Mbps, the transmission time is dominated bythe rate at which the bitscan be sent. By1Gbps, the 40-msec round-trip delay dominates the 1 msec it takes to put the bits on the fiber. Further increases in bandwidth have hardlyanyeffect atall. Figure 6-55 has unfortunate implications for network protocols. It says that stop-and-wait protocols, such as RPC, have an inherent upper bound on their per- formance. This limit is dictated by the speed of light. No amount of technologi- cal progress in optics will ever improve matters (new laws of physics would help, though). Unless some other use can be found for a gigabit line while a host is waiting for a reply, the gigabit line is no better than a megabit line, just more ex- pensive. Afifth problem isthat communication speeds have improved faster than com- puting speeds. (Note to computer engineers: go out and beat those communica- tion engineers! We are counting on you.) In the 1970s, the ARPANET ran at 56 kbps and had computers that ran at about 1 MIPS.

Time to transfer and acknowledge a 1-Mbit file over a 4000-km line. 1000-MIPScomputers exchanging packets over a 1-Gbps line. The number of in- structions per byte has decreased by more than a factor of 10. The exact numbers are debatable depending ondates and scenarios, butthe conclusion is this: there is less time available forprotocol processing than there usedtobe,soprotocols must become simpler. Let us now turn from the problems to ways of dealing with them. The basic principle thatallhigh-speed network designers shouldlearn byheart is: Design forspeed, notforbandwidthoptimization. Old protocols were often designed to minimize the number of bits on the wire, frequently by using small fields and packing them together into bytes and words. This concern is still valid for wireless networks, but not for gigabit networks. Protocol processing is the problem, so protocols should be designed to minimize it. TheIPv6designers clearly understoodthisprinciple. Atempting waytogofast istobuild fast network interfacesinhardware', 'The difficulty with this strategy is that unless the protocol is exceedinglysimple, hard- ware just means a plug-in board with a second CPU and its own program. To make sure the network coprocessor is cheaper than the main CPU, it is often a slower chip. The consequence of this design is that much of the time the main (fast) CPU is idle waiting for the second (slow) CPU to do the critical work. It is a myth to think that the main CPU has other work to do while waiting. Fur- thermore, when two general-purpose CPUs communicate, race conditions can oc- cur, so elaborate protocols are needed between the two processors to synchronize SEC. 6.6 PERFORMANCE ISSUES 599 them correctly and avoid races. Usually, the best approach is to make the proto- colssimple andhave themainCPUdothework. Packet layout is an important consideration in gigabit networks. The header should contain as few fields as possible, to reduce processing time, and these fields should be big enough to do the job and be word-aligned for fast processing. In this context, ‘‘big enough’’ means that problems such as sequence numbers wrapping around while old packets still exist, receivers being unable to advertise enoughwindowspacebecausethe windowfield istoosmall, etc. donotoccur. The maximum data size shouldbelarge, toreduce software overhead and per- mit efficient operation. 1500 bytes is too small for high-speed networks, which is why gigabit Ethernet supports jumbo frames of up to 9 KB and IPv6 supports jumbogrampackets inexcess of64KB. Let us now look at the issue of feedback in high-speed protocols. Due to the (relatively) long delay loop, feedback should be avoided: it takes too long for the receivertosignal the sender. One example offeedback is governing the transmis- sion rate by using a sliding window protocol. Future protocols may switch to rate-based protocols to avoid the (long) delays inherent in the receiver sending window updates to the sender. In such a protocol, the sender can send all it wants to, provided it does not send faster than some rate the sender and receiver have agreed uponinadvance. A second example of feedback is Jacobson’s slow start algorithm. This algo- rithm makes multiple probes to see how much the network can handle. With high-speed networks, making half a dozen or so small probes to see how the net- work respondswastes a hugeamountofbandwidth. Amoreefficient scheme isto have the sender, receiver, and network all reserve the necessary resources at con- nection setup time. Reserving resources in advance also has the advantage ofma- king it easier to reduce jitter. In short, going tohigh speeds inexorably pushes the designtoward connection-orientedoperation, orsomething fairly close toit. Another valuable feature is the ability to send a normal amount of data along withtheconnectionrequest. Inthisway, oneround-triptime can besaved. 6.7 DELAY-TOLERANT NETWORKING We willfinishthis chapter bydescribing a new kind of transport that may one daybeanimportant componentoftheInternet. TCP andmostother transport pro- tocols are based on the assumption that the sender and the receiver are continu- ously connected by some working path, or else the protocol fails and data cannot bedelivered. Insomenetworks there isoften noend-to-end path', 'Anexample isa space network as LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) satellites pass in and out of range of groundstations. Agiven satellite may be able tocommunicate toa ground station onlyat particular times, and twosatellitesmaynever beable tocommunicate with each other at any time, even via a ground station, because one of the satellites 600 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 may always be out of range. Other example networks involve submarines, buses, mobile phones, and other devices with computers for which there is intermittent connectivityduetomobilityorextreme conditions. In these occasionally connected networks, data can still be communicated by storing them at nodes and forwarding them later when there is a working link. This technique is called message switching. Eventually the data will be relayed tothe destination. Anetwork whose architecture isbased onthisapproach iscall- edaDTN(Delay-Tolerant Network,oraDisruption-Tolerant Network). Work on DTNs started in 2002 when IETF set up a research group on the topic. The inspiration for DTNs came from an unlikely source: efforts to send packets in space. Space networks must deal with intermittent communication and very long delays. Kevin Fall observed that the ideas for these Interplanetary In- ternets could be applied to networks on Earth in which intermittent connectivity was the norm (Fall, 2003). This model gives a useful generalization of the Inter- net in which storage and delays can occur during communication. Data delivery is akin to delivery in the postal system, or electronic mail, rather than packet switching atrouters. Since 2002,theDTNarchitecture has been refined, andthe applications ofthe DTN model have grown. As a mainstream application, consider large datasets of many terabytes that are produced by scientific experiments, media events, or Web-based services and need to be copied to datacenters at different locations around the world. Operators would like to send this bulk traffic at off-peak times to make use of bandwidth that has already been paid forbutisnotbeing used, and are willing totolerate some delay. It is like doing the backups at night when other applications are not making heavy use of the network. The problem is that, for global services, the off-peak times are different at locations around the world. There may be little overlap in the times when datacenters in Boston and Perth have off-peaknetwork bandwidth becausenightforonecityisdayfortheother. However, DTN models allow for storage and delays during transfer. With this model, it becomes possible to send the dataset from Boston to Amsterdam using off-peak bandwidth, as the cities have time zones that are only 6 hours apart. The dataset is then stored in Amsterdam until there is off-peak bandwidth between Amsterdam and Perth. It is then sent to Perth to complete the transfer. Laoutaris et al. (2009) have studied this model and find that it can provide sub- stantial capacity at little cost, and that the use of a DTN model often doubles that capacity compared withatraditionalend-to-end model. Inwhatfollows, wewilldescribe theIETF DTN architecture andprotocols. 6.7.1 DTN Architecture The main assumption in the Internet that DTNs seek to relax is that an end- to-end path between a source and a destination exists for the entire duration of a communication session', 'When this is not the case, the normal Internet protocols SEC. 6.7 DELAY-TOLERANT NETWORKING 601 fail. DTNs get around the lack of end-to-end connectivity with an architecture that is based on message switching, as shown in Fig.6-56. It is also intended to tolerate links withlowreliabilityandlarge delays. Thearchitecture isspecified in RFC 4838. Sent Contact Intermittentlink bundle (workinglink) (notworking) DTN node Storage Stored bundle Source Destination Figure6-56. Delay-tolerant networkingarchitecture. In DTN terminology, a message is called a bundle. DTN nodes are equipped with storage, typically persistent storage such as a disk or flash memory. They storebundlesuntillinks become available andthen forward the bundles.The links work intermittently. Fig.6-56 shows five intermittent links that are not currently working, and two links that are working. A working link is called a contact. Fig.6-56 also shows bundles stored at two DTN nodes awaiting contacts to send the bundles onward. In this way, the bundles are relayed via contacts from the source totheir destination. The storing and forwarding of bundles at DTN nodes sounds similar to the queueing and forwarding of packets at routers, but there are qualitative dif- ferences. In routers in the Internet, queueing occurs for milliseconds or at most seconds. At DTN nodes, bundles may be stored for hours, until a bus arrives in town, while an airplane completes a flight, until a sensor node harvests enough solar energy to run, until a sleeping computer wakes up, and so forth. These ex- amples also point to a second difference, which is that nodes may move (with a bus or plane) while they hold stored data, and this movement may even be a key part of data delivery. Routers in the Internet are not allowed to move. The whole process ofmovingbundlesmightbebetter knownas‘‘store-carry-forward.’’ As an example, consider the scenario shown in Fig.6-57 that was the first use of DTN protocols in space (Wood et al., 2008). The source of bundles is an LEO satellite that is recording Earth images as part of the Disaster Monitoring Constel- lation of satellites. The images mustbe returned tothe collection point. However, the satellite has onlyintermittent contact with three groundstations as it orbits the Earth. It comes into contact with each ground station inturn. Each of the satellite, ground stations, and collection point act as a DTN node. At each contact, a 602 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 bundle (or a portion of a bundle) is sent to a ground station. The bundles are then sent over a backhaul terrestrial network to the collection point to complete the transfer. Satellite Intermittentlink Contact (notworking) (workinglink) Bundle Storageat DTNnodes Ground station Collectionpoint Figure6-57. UseofaDTNinspace. The primary advantage of the DTN architecture in this example is that it nat- urally fits the situation of the satellite needing to store images because there is no connectivity at the time the image is taken. There are two further advantages. First, there may be no single contact long enough to send the images. However, they can be spread across the contacts with three ground stations. Second, the use ofthe linkbetween the satelliteand groundstation isdecoupledfromthelinkover the backhaul network', 'This means that the satellite download is not limited by a slow terrestrial link. It can proceed at full speed, with the bundle stored at the groundstation untilitcan berelayed tothecollection point. Animportant issuethatisnotspecified bythe architecture ishowtofindgood routes via DTN nodes. A route in this path to use. Good routes depend on the nature of the architecture describes when to send data, and also which contacts. Some contacts are known ahead of time. A good example is the motion of heavenly bodies in the space example. For the space experiment, it was known ahead of time when contacts would occur, that the contact intervals ranged from5 to 14 minutes per pass with each ground station, and that the downlink capacity was 8.134 Mbps. Given this knowledge, the transport of a bundle of images can beplanned ahead oftime. Inother cases, thecontacts can bepredicted, butwith less certainty. Examples include buses that make contact with each other in mostly regular ways, due to a timetable, yet with some variation, and the times and amount of off-peak band- width in ISP networks, which are predicted from past data. At the other extreme, the contacts are occasional and random. One example is carrying data from user SEC. 6.7 DELAY-TOLERANT NETWORKING 603 to user on mobile phones depending on which users make contact with each other during the day. When there is unpredictability in contacts, one routing strategy is to send copies of the bundle along different paths in the hope that one of the cop- iesisdelivered tothedestination before thelifetime isreached. 6.7.2 The Bundle Protocol To take a closer look at the operation of DTNs, we will now look at the IETF protocols. DTNs are an emerging kind of network, and experimental DTNs have used different protocols, as there is no requirement that the IETF protocols be used. However, they are at least a good place to start and highlight many of the keyissues. The DTN protocol stack is shown in Fig. 6-58. The key protocol is the Bun- dle protocol, which is specified in RFC 5050. It is responsible for accepting mes- sages from the application and sending them as one or more bundles via store- carry-forward operations to the destination DTN node. It is also apparent from Fig.6-58thattheBundleprotocol runsabovethelevel ofTCP/IP. Inother words, TCP/IP may be used over each contact to move bundles between DTN nodes. This positioning raises the issue of whether the Bundle protocol is a transport layer protocol or an application layer protocol. Just as with RTP, we take the positionthat, despite runningoveratransport protocol, the Bundleprotocol ispro- viding a transport service to many different applications, and so we cover DTNs inthischapter. Upper Application layers BundleProtocol DTN layer Convergencelayer Convergencelayer TCP/IP .... Other Lower Internet internet layers Figure6-58. Delay-tolerant networkingprotocolstack. In Fig. 6-58, we see that the Bundle protocol may be run over other kinds of protocols such as UDP, or even other kinds of internets. For example, in a space network the links may have very long delays', 'The round-trip time between Earth and Mars can easily be 20 minutes depending on the relative position of the planets. Imagine how well TCP acknowledgements and retransmissions will work over that link, especially for relatively short messages. Not well at all. Instead, 604 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 another protocol that uses error-correcting codes might be used. Or in sensor net- works that are very resource constrained, a more lightweight protocol than TCP maybeused. Since the Bundle protocol is fixed, yet it is intended to run over a variety of transports, there is must be a gap in functionality between the protocols. That gap is the reason for the inclusion of a convergence layer in Fig.6-58. The conver- gence layer is just a glue layer that matches the interfaces of the protocols that it joins. By definition there is a different convergence layer for each different lower layer transport. Convergence layers are commonly found in standards to join new andexisting protocols. The format of Bundle protocol messages is shown in Fig.6-59. The different fields in these messages tell us some of the key issues that are handled by the Bundleprotocol. Primaryblock Payloadblock Optionalblocks Bits 8 20 variable 8 6 variable Ver. Flags Dest. Source ReportCustodianCreation LifetimeDictionary Type Flags Length Data Bits 7 7 6 Status Classof General report service Figure6-59. Bundleprotocolmessageformat. Each message consists of a primary block, which can be thought of as a head- er, a payload block for the data, and optionally other blocks, for example to carry security parameters. The primary block begins with a Version field (currently 6) followed by a Flags field. Among other functions, the flags encode a class of ser- vice to let a source mark its bundles as higher or lower priority, and other han- dlingrequests suchaswhether thedestination shouldacknowledgethebundle. Then come addresses, which highlight three interesting parts of the design. As well as a Destination and Source identifier field, there is a Custodian identifier. The custodian is the party responsible for seeing that the bundle is delivered. In the Internet, the source node is usually the custodian, as it is the node that retrans- mits if the data is not ultimately delivered to the destination. However, in a DTN, the source node may not always be connected and may have no way of knowing whether the data has been delivered. DTNs deal with this problem using the notion of custody transfer, in which another node, closer to the destination, can assume responsibility for seeing the data safely delivered. For example, if a bun- dle isstored onan airplane forforwarding atalater timeandlocation, theairplane maybecome thecustodian ofthebundle. SEC. 6.7 DELAY-TOLERANT NETWORKING 605 The secondinteresting aspect isthat these identifiers are notIP addresses. Be- cause the Bundle protocol is intended to work across a variety of transports and internets, it defines its own identifiers. These identifiers are really more like high-level names, such as Web page URLs, than low-level addresses, such as IP addresses. They give DTNs an aspect of application-level routing, such as email delivery orthedistribution ofsoftware updates', 'The third interesting aspect is the way the identifiers are encoded. There is also a Report identifier for diagnostic messages. All of the identifiers are encoded as references to a variable length Dictionary field. This provides compression when the custodian or report nodes are the same as the source or the destination. Infact, much ofthe message format has been designed with both extensibility and efficiency in mind by using a compact representation of variable length fields. The compact representation is important for wireless links and resource- constrained nodessuchasinasensor network. Next comes a Creation field carrying the time at which the bundle was creat- ed, along with a sequence number from the source for ordering, plus a Lifetime field that tells the time at which the bundle data is no longer useful. These fields exist because data may be stored for a long period at DTN nodes and there must be some way to remove stale data from the network. Unlike the Internet, they re- quire thatDTNnodeshave looselysynchronized clocks. The primary block is completed with the Dictionary field. Then comes the payload block. This block starts with a short Type field that identifies it as a pay- load, followed by a small set of Flags that describe processing options. Then comes the Data field, preceded by a Length field. Finally, there may be other, op- tional blocks, suchasablockthatcarries security parameters. Many aspects of DTNs are being explored in the research community. Good strategies for routing depend on the nature of the contacts, as was mentioned above.Storing data inside the network raises other issues. Nowcongestioncontrol must consider storage at nodes as another kind of resource that can be depleted. The lack ofend-to-end communication also exacerbates security problems. Before a DTN node takes custody of a bundle, it may want to know that the sender is authorized to use the network and that the bundle is probably wanted by the desti- nation. Solutions to these problems will depend onthe kind of DTN, as space net- worksare different fromsensor networks. 6.8 SUMMARY The transport layer is the key to understanding layered protocols. It provides various services, the most important of which is an end-to-end, reliable, con- nection-oriented byte stream from sender to receiver. It is accessed through ser- vice primitives that permit the establishment, use, and release of connections. A commontransport layer interfaceisthe oneprovidedbyBerkeley sockets. 606 THETRANSPORT LAYER CHAP. 6 Transport protocols must be able to do connection management over unre- liable networks. Connection establishment is complicated by the existence of de- layed duplicate packets that can reappear at inopportune moments. To deal with them, three-way handshakes are needed to establish connections. Releasing a connection is easier than establishing one but is still far from trivial due to the two-army problem. Even when the network layer is completely reliable, the transport layer has plenty of work to do. It must handle all the service primitives, manage connec- tions and timers, allocate bandwidth with congestion control, and run a variable- sized slidingwindowforflowcontrol', 'Congestion control should allocate all of the available bandwidth between competing flows fairly, and it should track changes in the usage of the network. The AIMDcontrol lawconvergestoafair andefficient allocation. The Internet has two main transport protocols: UDP and TCP. UDP is a con- nectionless protocol that is mainly a wrapper for IP packets with the additional feature of multiplexing and demultiplexing multiple processes using a single IP address. UDP can be used for client-server interactions, for example, using RPC. Itcanalso beusedforbuildingreal-time protocols suchasRTP. The main Internet transport protocol is TCP. It provides a reliable, bidirec- tional, congestion-controlled byte stream with a 20-byte header on all segments. Agreat deal ofworkhasgoneintooptimizing TCP performance, usingalgorithms fromNagle, Clark, Jacobson, Karn, andothers. Network performance is typically dominated by protocol and segment proc- essing overhead, and this situation gets worse at higher speeds. Protocols should be designed to minimize the number of segments and work for large bandwidth- delay paths. For gigabit networks, simple protocols and streamlined processing are called for. Delay-tolerant networking provides a delivery service across networks that have occasional connectivity or long delays across links. Intermediate nodes store, carry, and forward bundles of information so that it is eventually delivered, even ifthere isnoworkingpathfromsender toreceiveratanytime. PROBLEMS 1.

Thelayers belowtheapplication layer are there toprovide transport services, but they do not do real work for users. In this chapter, we will studysomereal network applications. However, even intheapplication layer there isaneed forsupportprotocols, to allow the applications to function', 'Accordingly, we will look at an important one of these before starting with the applications themselves. The item in question is DNS, which handles naming within the Internet. After that, we will examine three real applications: electronic mail, the World Wide Web, and multimedia. We will finish the chapter bysaying more aboutcontent distribution, including by peer-to-peer networks. 7.1 DNS—THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM Although programs theoretically could refer to Web pages, mailboxes, and other resources by using the network (e.g., IP) addresses of the computers on which they are stored, these addresses are hard for people to remember. Also, browsing a company’s Web pages from 128.111.24.41 means that if the company movestheWebserver toadifferent machine with adifferent IP address, everyone needs to be told the new IP address. Consequently, high-level, readable names were introduced in order to decouple machine names from machine addresses. In 611 612 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 this way, the company’s Web server might be known as www.cs.washington.edu regardless of its IP address. Nevertheless, since the network itself understands only numerical addresses, some mechanism is required to convert the names to network addresses. In the following sections, we will study how this mapping is accomplishedintheInternet. Way back inthe ARPANET days, there was simply afile, hosts.txt,that listed all the computer names and their IP addresses. Every night, all the hosts would fetch it from the site at which it was maintained. For a network of a few hundred large timesharing machines, thisapproach worked reasonably well. However, well before many millions of PCs were connected to the Internet, everyone involved with it realized that this approach could not continue to work forever. For one thing, the size of the file would become too large. However, even more importantly, host name conflicts would occur constantly unless names were centrally managed, something unthinkable in a huge international network due to the load and latency. To solve these problems, DNS (Domain Name Sys- tem)was invented in1983. Ithasbeen akeypart oftheInternet ever since. The essence of DNS is the invention of a hierarchical, domain-based naming scheme and a distributed database system for implementing this naming scheme. It is primarily used for mapping host names to IP addresses but can also be used for other purposes. DNS is defined in RFCs 1034, 1035, 2181, and further ela- borated inmanyothers. Very briefly, the way DNS is used is as follows. To map a name onto an IP address, an application program calls a library procedure called the resolver, pas- sing it the name as a parameter. We saw an example of a resolver, gethost- byname, in Fig. 6-6. The resolver sends a query containing the name to a local DNSserver, whichlooksupthe name andreturns a responsecontaining the IP ad- dress to the resolver, which then returns it to the caller. The query and response messages are sent as UDP packets. Armed with the IP address, the program can thenestablish aTCP connectionwiththehostorsenditUDPpackets. 7.1.1 The DNS Name Space Managing a large and constantly changing set of names is a nontrivial prob- lem', 'In the postal system, name management isdonebyrequiring letters tospeci- fy (implicitly or explicitly) the country, state or province, city, street address, and name of the addressee. Using this kind of hierarchical addressing ensures that there is no confusion between the Marvin Anderson on Main St. in White Plains, N.Y. and the Marvin Anderson on Main St. in Austin, Texas. DNS works the same way. For the Internet, the top of the naming hierarchy is managed by an organiza- tion called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). ICANN was created for this purpose in 1998, as part of the maturing of the Inter- net to a worldwide, economic concern. Conceptually, the Internet is divided into SEC. 7.1 DNS—THEDOMAINNAMESYSTEM 613 over 250 top-level domains, where each domain covers many hosts. Each do- main is partitioned into subdomains, and these are further partitioned, and so on. All these domains can be represented by a tree, as shown in Fig.7-1. The leaves of the tree represent domains that have no subdomains (but do contain machines, of course). A leaf domain may contain a single host, or it may represent a com- panyandcontain thousandsofhosts.

AportionoftheInternetdomainnamespace. The top-level domains come in two flavors: generic and countries. The gen- eric domains, listed in Fig. 7-2, include original domains from the 1980s and do- mains introduced via applications to ICANN. Other generic top-level domains willbeadded inthefuture. The country domains include one entry for every country, as defined in ISO 3166. Internationalized country domain names that use non-Latin alphabets were introduced in 2010. These domains let people name hosts in Arabic, Cyrillic, Chinese, orother languages. Getting a second-level domain, such as name-of-company.com, is easy. The top-level domains are run by registrars appointed by ICANN. Getting a name merely requires going to a corresponding registrar (for com in this case) to check if the desired name is available and not somebody else’s trademark. If there are noproblems, therequester paystheregistrar asmall annualfee andgets thename. However, as the Internet has become more commercial and more internation- al, it has also become more contentious, especially in matters related to naming. This controversy includes ICANN itself. For example, the creation of the xxx do- main took several years and court cases to resolve. Is voluntarily placing adult content initsown domain a goodor a bad thing? (Some people did notwant adult content available at all on the Internet while others wanted to put it all in one do- main so nanny filters could easily find and block it from children). Some of the domains self-organize, while others have restrictions on who can obtain a name, as noted in Fig.7-2. But what restrictions are appropriate? Take the pro domain, 614 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP', '7 Domain Intendeduse Startdate Restricted? com Commercial 1985 No edu Educationalinstitutions 1985 Yes gov Government 1985 Yes int Internationalorganizations 1988 Yes mil Military 1985 Yes net Networkproviders 1985 No org Non-profitorganizations 1985 No aero Airtransport 2001 Yes biz Businesses 2001 No coop Cooperatives 2001 Yes info Informational 2002 No museum Museums 2002 Yes name People 2002 No pro Professionals 2002 Yes cat Catalan 2005 Yes jobs Employment 2005 Yes mobi Mobiledevices 2005 Yes tel Contactdetails 2005 Yes travel Travelindustry 2005 Yes xxx Sexindustry 2010 No Figure7-2.

But what about freelance photographers, piano teachers, magicians, plumbers, barbers, exterminators, tattoo artists, mer- cenaries, andprostitutes? Are these occupations eligible? According towhom? There is also money in names. Tuvalu (the country) sold a lease on its tv do- main for $50 million, all because the country code is well-suited to advertising television sites. Virtually every common (English) word has been taken in the com domain, along with the most common misspellings. Try household articles, animals, plants, body parts, etc. The practice of registering a domain only to turn around and sell it off to an interested party at a much higher price even has a name. It is called cybersquatting. Many companies that were slow off the mark when the Internet era began found their obvious domain names already taken when they tried to acquire them. In general, as long as no trademarks are being violated and no fraud is involved, it is first-come, first-served with names. Never- theless, policies toresolve namingdisputesare stillbeingrefined. SEC. 7.1 DNS—THEDOMAINNAMESYSTEM 615 Each domain isnamed bythe path upward from it tothe (unnamed) root. The components are separated by periods (pronounced ‘‘dot’’). Thus, the engineering department at Cisco might be eng.cisco.com., rather than aUNIX-style name such as /com/cisco/eng. Notice that this hierarchical naming means that eng.cisco.com. does not conflict with a potential use of eng in eng.washington.edu., which might beusedbytheEnglishdepartment attheUniversity ofWashington. Domain names can be either absolute or relative. An absolute domain name always ends with a period (e.g., eng.cisco.com.), whereas a relative one does not. Relative names have tobe interpreted in some context to uniquely determine their true meaning. In both cases, a named domain refers to a specific node in the tree andallthenodesunderit. Domain names are case-insensitive, so edu, Edu, and EDU mean the same thing. Component names can be up to 63 characters long, and full path names mustnotexceed255characters. In principle, domains can be inserted into the tree in either generic or country domains. For example, cs.washington.edu could equally well be listed under the us country domain as cs.washington.wa.us. In practice, however, most organiza- tions in the United States are under generic domains, and most outside the United States are under the domain of their country. There is no rule against registering under multiple top-level domains. Large companies often do so (e.g., sony.com, sony.net,andsony.nl). Each domain controls how it allocates the domains under it. For example, Japan has domains ac.jp andco.jp that mirror eduandcom', 'TheNetherlands does not make this distinction and puts all organizations directly under nl. Thus, all three ofthefollowing are university computer science departments: 1. cs.washington.edu (University ofWashington, intheU.S.). 2. cs.vu.nl (Vrije Universiteit, inThe Netherlands). 3. cs.keio.ac.jp (Keio University, inJapan). To create a new domain, permission is required of the domain in which it will be included. For example, if a VLSI group is started at the University of Wash- ington and wants to be known as vlsi.cs.washington.edu, it has to get permission from whoever manages cs.washington.edu. Similarly, if a new university is char- tered, say, the University of Northern South Dakota, it must ask the manager of the edu domain to assign it unsd.edu (if that is still available). In this way, name conflicts are avoided and each domain can keep track of all its subdomains. Once a new domain has been created and registered, it can create subdomains, such as cs.unsd.edu,withoutgettingpermission fromanybodyhigher upthetree. Naming follows organizational boundaries, not physical networks. For ex- ample, if the computer science and electrical engineering departments are located in the same building and share the same LAN, they can nevertheless have distinct 616 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 domains. Similarly, even if computer science is split over Babbage Hall and Tur- ingHall, thehostsinbothbuildingswillnormally belongtothesame domain. 7.1.2 Domain Resource Records Every domain, whether it isa single hostoratop-level domain, can have a set of resource records associated with it. These records are the DNS database. For a single host, the most common resource record is just its IP address, but many other kinds of resource records also exist. When a resolver gives a domain name to DNS, what it gets back are the resource records associated with that name.Thus, the primary function of DNS is to map domain names onto resource records. A resource record is a five-tuple. Although they are encoded in binary for ef- ficiency, in most expositions resource records are presented as ASCII text, one lineperresource record. Theformat wewilluseisasfollows: Domain name Time to live Class Type Value The Domain name tells the domain towhich this record applies. Normally, many records exist for each domain and each copy of the database holds information about multiple domains. This field is thus the primary search key used to satisfy queries. The orderoftherecords inthedatabase isnotsignificant. The Time to live field gives an indication of how stable the record is. Infor- mation that is highly stable is assigned a large value, such as 86400 (the number of seconds in 1 day). Information that is highly volatile is assigned a small value, such as 60 (1 minute). We will come back to this point later when we have dis- cussed caching. The thirdfield ofevery resource record isthe Class. For Internet information, it is always IN. For non-Internet information, other codes can be used, but in practice these are rarely seen. The Type field tells what kindofrecord thisis. There are many kinds of DNS records. Theimportant typesare listed inFig.7-3', 'An SOA record provides the name of the primary source of information about the name server’s zone (described below), the email address ofits administrator, a uniqueserial number, andvariousflagsandtimeouts. The most important record type is the A (Address) record. It holds a 32-bit IPv4 address of an interface for some host. The corresponding AAAA, or ‘‘quad A,’’ record holds a 128-bit IPv6 address. Every Internet host must have at least one IP address so that other machines can communicate with it. Some hosts have two or more network interfaces, in which case they will have two or more type A or AAAA resource records. Consequently, DNS can return multiple addresses for asingle name. A common record type is the MX record. It specifies the name of the host prepared to accept email for the specified domain. It is used because not every SEC. 7.1 DNS—THEDOMAINNAMESYSTEM 617 Type Meaning Value SOA Startofauthority Parametersforthiszone A IPv4addressofahost 32-Bitinteger AAAA IPv6addressofahost 128-Bitinteger MX Mailexchange Priority,domainwillingtoacceptemail NS Nameserver Nameofaserverforthisdomain CNAME Canonicalname Domainname PTR Pointer AliasforanIPaddress SPF Senderpolicyframework Textencodingofmailsendingpolicy SRV Service Hostthatprovidesit TXT Text DescriptiveASCIItext Figure7-3. TheprincipalDNSresourcerecordtypes. machine is prepared to accept email. If someone wants to send email to, for ex- ample, bill@microsoft.com, the sending host needs to find some mail server loca- ted at microsoft.com that is willing to accept email. The MX record can provide thisinformation. Another important record type is the NS record. It specifies a name server for the domain or subdomain. This is a host that has a copy of the database for a do- main. It is used as part of the process to look up names, which we will describe shortly. CNAME records allow aliases to be created. For example, a person familiar with Internet naming in general and wanting to send a message touser paul in the computer science department at M.I.T. might guess that paul@cs.mit.edu will work. Actually, this address will not work, because the domain for M.I.T.’s com- puter science department iscsail.mit.edu. However, asa service topeople whodo not know this, M.I.T. could create a CNAME entry to point people and programs intherightdirection. Anentry likethisonemightdothejob: cs.mit.edu 86400 IN CNAME csail.mit.edu Like CNAME, PTR points to another name. However, unlike CNAME, which is really just a macro definition (i.e., a mechanism to replace one string by anoth- er), PTR is a regular DNS data type whose interpretation depends on the context in which it is found. In practice, it is nearly always used to associate a name with anIPaddress toallow lookupsoftheIPaddress and return the name ofthe corres- pondingmachine. These are called reverse lookups. SRV is a newer type of record that allows a host to be identified for a given service in a domain. For example, the Web server for cs.washington.edu could be identified as cockatoo.cs.washington.edu. This record generalizes the MX record thatperforms thesame task butitisjustformail servers. 618 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 SPF is also a newer type of record. It lets a domain encode information about what machines in the domain will send mail to the rest of the Internet. This helps receiving machines check that mail is valid', 'If mail is being received from a ma- chine that calls itself dodgy but the domain records say that mail will only be sent out of the domain by a machine called smtp, chances are that the mail is forged junkmail. Last on the list, TXT records were originally provided to allow domains to identify themselves in arbitrary ways. Nowadays, they usually encode machine- readable information, typically theSPFinformation. Finally, we have the Value field. This field can be a number, a domain name, oranASCII string. The semantics depend onthe record type. Ashortdescription oftheValue fields foreachoftheprincipal record typesisgiveninFig. 7-3. Foranexample ofthekindofinformation onemightfindintheDNS database of a domain, see Fig. 7-4. This figure depicts part of a (hypothetical)database for the cs.vu.nl domain shown in Fig. 7-1. The database contains seven types of re- source records. ;Authoritativedataforcs.vu.nl cs.vu.nl. 86400 IN SOA starboss(9527,7200,7200,241920,86400) cs.vu.nl. 86400 IN MX 1zephyr cs.vu.nl. 86400 IN MX 2top cs.vu.nl. 86400 IN NS star star 86400 IN A 130.37.56.205 zephyr 86400 IN A 130.37.20.10 top 86400 IN A 130.37.20.11 www 86400 IN CNAME star.cs.vu.nl ftp 86400 IN CNAME zephyr.cs.vu.nl flits 86400 IN A 130.37.16.112 flits 86400 IN A 192.31.231.165 flits 86400 IN MX 1flits flits 86400 IN MX 2zephyr flits 86400 IN MX 3top rowboat IN A 130.37.56.201 IN MX 1rowboat IN MX 2zephyr little-sister IN A 130.37.62.23 laserjet IN A 192.31.231.216 Figure7-4. AportionofapossibleDNSdatabaseforcs.vu.nl. The first noncomment line of Fig. 7-4 gives some basic information about the domain, which willnot concern us further. Then come two entries giving the first SEC. 7.1 DNS—THEDOMAINNAMESYSTEM 619 and second places to try to deliver email sent to person@cs.vu.nl. The zephyr (a specific machine) should be tried first. If that fails, the top should be tried as the nextchoice. The nextlineidentifies thename server forthedomainasstar. After the blank line (added for readability) come lines giving the IP addresses forthe star,zephyr,andtop. These are followed byanalias, www.cs.vu.nl,sothat this address can be used without designating a specific machine. Creating this alias allows cs.vu.nl to change its World Wide Web server without invalidating theaddress people usetogettoit. Asimilar argument holdsforftp.cs.vu.nl. The section for the machine flits lists two IP addresses and three choices are given for handling email sent to flits.cs.vu.nl. First choice is naturally the flits it- self, butifitisdown,thezephyr andtopare thesecondandthirdchoices. The next three lines contain a typical entry for a computer, in this case, rowboat.cs.vu.nl. The information provided contains the IP address and the pri- mary and secondary mail drops. Then comes an entry for a computer that is not capable of receiving mail itself, followed by an entry that is likely for a printer thatisconnectedtotheInternet. 7.1.3 Name Servers In theory at least, a single name server could contain the entire DNS database andrespondtoall queries aboutit. Inpractice, thisserver wouldbesooverloaded as to be useless. Furthermore, if it ever went down, the entire Internet would be crippled. To avoid the problems associated with having only a single source of infor- mation, the DNS name space is divided into nonoverlapping zones. One possible way to divide the name space of Fig.7-1 is shown in Fig. 7-5. Each circled zone contains somepart ofthetree', 'Generic Countries aero com edu gov museum org net ... au jp uk us nl ... cisco washington acm ieee edu ac co vu oce eng cs eng jack jill uwa keio nec cs law robot cs csl flits fluit Figure7-5. PartoftheDNSnamespacedividedintozones(whicharecircled). 620 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Where the zone boundaries are placed within a zone is up to that zone’s ad- ministrator. This decision is made in large part based on how many name servers are desired, and where. For example, in Fig. 7-5, the University of Washington has a zone for washington.edu that handles eng.washington.edu but does not han- dle cs.washington.edu. That isa separate zone with its own name servers. Such a decision might be made when a department such as English does not wish to run itsownname server, butadepartment suchasComputer Science does. Each zone is also associated with one or more name servers. These are hosts that hold the database forthe zone. Normally, azone willhave one primary name server, which gets its information from a file on its disk, and one or more sec- ondary name servers, which get their information from the primary name server. Toimprove reliability,someofthename servers can belocated outsidethezone. The process oflookingupaname and findingan address iscalled name reso- lution. When aresolver hasaqueryaboutadomainname, itpasses thequerytoa local name server. If the domain being sought falls under the jurisdiction of the name server, such as top.cs.vu.nl falling under cs.vu.nl, it returns the authoritative resource records. An authoritative record is one that comes from the authority that manages the record and is thus always correct. Authoritative records are in contrast tocached records,which maybeoutofdate. What happens when the domain isremote, such as when flits.cs.vu.nl wants to find the IP address of robot.cs.washington.edu at UW (University of Washing- ton)? In this case, and if there is no cached information about the domain avail- able locally, the name server begins a remote query. This query follows the proc- ess shown in Fig.7-6. Step 1 shows the query that is sent to the local name ser- ver. Thequerycontains thedomainname sought,thetype(A),andtheclass(IN).

Exampleofaresolverlookinguparemotenamein10steps. The next step is to start at the top of the name hierarchy by asking one of the root name servers. These name servers have information about each top-level SEC. 7.1 DNS—THEDOMAINNAMESYSTEM 621 domain. This is shown as step 2 in Fig.7-6', 'To contact a root server, each name server must have information about one or more root name servers. This infor- mation is normally present in a system configuration file that is loaded into the DNS cachewhen the DNS server isstarted. ItissimplyalistofNSrecords forthe rootandthecorrespondingArecords. There are 13 root DNS servers, unimaginatively called a-root-servers.net throughm.root-servers.net. Each rootserver couldlogically beasingle computer. However, since the entire Internet depends on the root servers, they are powerful and heavily replicated computers. Most of the servers are present in multiple geo- graphical locations and reached using anycast routing, in which a packet is deliv- ered to the nearest instance of a destination address; we described anycast in Chap. 5Thereplication improves reliabilityandperformance. The root name server is unlikely to know the address of a machine at UW, and probably does not know the name server for UW either. But it must know the name server for the edu domain, in which cs.washington.edu is located. It returns thename andIPaddress forthatpartoftheanswer instep3. The local name server then continues its quest. It sends the entire query to the edu name server (a.edu-servers.net). That name server returns the name server for UW. This is shown in steps 4 and 5. Closer now, the local name server sends the query to the UW name server (step 6). If the domain name being sought was in the English department, the answer would be found, as the UW zone includes the English department. But the Computer Science department has chosen to run its own name server. The query returns the name and IP address of the UW Com- puter Science name server (step7). Finally, the local name server queries the UW Computer Science name server (step 8). This server is authoritative for the domain cs.washington.edu, so it must have the answer. It returns the final answer (step 9), which the local name server forwards asaresponsetoflits.cs.vu.nl(step 10). The name hasbeen resolved. Youcan explore this process usingstandard toolssuch as the digprogram that isinstalled onmostUNIX systems. Forexample, typing dig@a.edu-servers.netrobot.cs.washington.edu will send a query for robot.cs.washington.edu to the a.edu-servers.net name ser- ver and print out the result. This will show you the information obtained in step 4 in the example above, and you will learn the name and IP address of the UW name servers. There are three technical points todiscuss about this long scenario. First, two different query mechanisms are at work in Fig. 7-6. When the host flits.cs.vu.nl sends its query to the local name server, that name server handles the resolution onbehalf of flits until it has the desired answer toreturn. It does notreturn partial answers. They mightbehelpful, butthey are notwhat the query was seeking. This mechanism iscalled arecursivequery. 622 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 On the other hand, the root name server (and each subsequent name server) does not recursively continue the query for the local name server. It just returns a partial answer and moves on to the next query. The local name server is responsi- ble for continuing the resolution by issuing further queries. This mechanism is called aniterative query', 'One name resolution can involve both mechanisms, as this example showed. A recursive query may always seem preferable, but many name servers (especial- ly the root) will not handle them. They are too busy. Iterative queries put the bur- den on the originator. The rationale for the local name server supporting a recur- sive query is that it is providing a service to hosts in its domain. Those hosts do nothave tobeconfigured torunafullname server, justtoreachthelocal one. The second point is caching. All of the answers, including all the partial answers returned, are cached. In this way, if another cs.vu.nl host queries for robot.cs.washington.edu the answer will already be known. Even better, if a host queries for a different host in the same domain, say galah.cs.washington.edu, the query can be sent directly to the authoritative name server. Similarly, queries for other domains in washington.edu can start directly from the washington.edu name server. Using cached answers greatly reduces the steps in a query and improves performance. The original scenario we sketched is in fact the worst case that oc- curswhennouseful information iscached. However, cached answers are not authoritative, since changes made at cs.washington.edu will not be propagated to all the caches in the world that may know about it. For this reason, cache entries should not live too long. This is the reason that the Time to live field is included in each resource record. It tells re- mote name servers how long to cache records. If a certain machine has had the same IP address for years, it may be safe to cache that information for 1 day. For more volatile information, it might be safer to purge the records after a few sec- ondsoraminute. The third issue is the transport protocol that is used for the queries and re- sponses. It is UDP. DNS messages are sent in UDP packets with a simple format forqueries, answers, and name servers that can be used to continue the resolution. We will not go into the details of this format. If noresponse arrives within a short time, the DNS client repeats the query, trying another server for the domain after a small number of retries. This process is designed to handle the case of the ser- ver being down as well as the query or response packet getting lost. A 16-bit identifier is included in each query and copied to the response so that a name ser- ver can match answers to the corresponding query, even if multiple queries are outstanding atthesame time. Even though its purpose is simple, it should be clear that DNS is a large and complex distributed system that is comprised of millions of name servers that work together. It forms a key link between human-readable domain names and the IP addresses of machines. It includes replication and caching for performance andreliabilityandisdesigned tobehighlyrobust. SEC. 7.1 DNS—THEDOMAINNAMESYSTEM 623 We have not covered security, butas youmight imagine, the ability tochange the name-to-address mapping can have devastating consequences if done mali- ciously. For that reason, security extensions called DNSSEC have been developed forDNS', 'We willdescribe theminChap. 8. There is also application demand to use names in more flexible ways, for ex- ample, bynaming content andresolving tothe IP address ofanearby hostthathas the content. This fits the model of searching for and downloading a movie. It is the movie that matters, notthe computer that has a copy of it, soall that iswanted is the IP address of any nearby computer that has a copy of the movie. Content distribution networks are one way to accomplish this mapping. We will describe howtheybuildontheDNSlater inthischapter, inSec. 7.5. 7.2 ELECTRONIC MAIL Electronic mail, or more commonly email, has been around for over three decades. Faster and cheaper than paper mail, email has been a popular applica- tion since the early days of the Internet. Before 1990, it was mostly used in academia. During the 1990s, it became known to the public at large and grew exponentially, to the point where the number of emails sent per day now is vastly more than the number of snail mail (i.e., paper) letters. Other forms of network communication, such as instant messaging and voice-over-IP calls have expanded greatly in use over the past decade, but email remains the workhorse of Internet communication. It is widely used within industry for intracompany communica- tion, for example, to allow far-flung employees all over the world to cooperate on complex projects. Unfortunately, like paper mail, the majority of email—some 9 outof10messages—is junkmailorspam(McAfee, 2010). Email, like most other forms of communication, has developed its own con- ventions and styles. It is very informal and has a low threshold of use. People who would never dream of calling up or even writing a letter to a Very Important Person do not hesitate for a second to send a sloppily written email to him or her. By eliminating most cues associated with rank, age, and gender, email debates often focus oncontent, notstatus. With email, a brilliantidea from asummer stu- dentcan have more impact thanadumbonefromanexecutive vice president. Email is full of jargon such as BTW (By The Way), ROTFL (Rolling On The Floor Laughing), and IMHO (In My Humble Opinion). Many people also use lit- tle ASCII symbols called smileys, starting with the ubiquitous ‘‘:-)’’. Rotate the book 90 degrees clockwise if this symbol is unfamiliar. This symbol and other emoticons help to convey the tone of the message. They have spread to other terse formsofcommunication, suchasinstant messaging. The email protocols have evolved during the period of their use, too. The first email systems simply consisted of file transfer protocols, with the convention that the first line ofeachmessage (i.e., file) contained the recipient’s address. As time 624 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 went on, email diverged from file transfer and many features were added, such as the ability to send one message to a list of recipients. Multimedia capabilities became important in the 1990s to send messages with images and other non-text material', 'Programs for reading email became much more sophisticated too, shift- ing from text-based to graphical user interfaces and adding the ability for users to access their mail from their laptops wherever they happen to be. Finally, with the prevalence of spam, mail readers and the mail transfer protocols must now pay attention tofindingandremoving unwanted email. In our description of email, we will focus on the way that mail messages are moved between users, rather than the look and feel of mail reader programs. Nevertheless, after describing the overall architecture, we will begin with the user-facingpartoftheemail system, asitisfamiliartomostreaders. 7.2.1 Architecture and Services In this section, we will provide an overview of how email systems are organ- ized and what they can do. The architecture of the email system is shown in Fig.7-7. It consists of two kinds of subsystems: the user agents, which allow people to read and send email, and the message transfer agents, which move the messages from the source to the destination. We will also refer to message trans- feragents informally asmailservers. Mailbox Email Message SMTP Message Sender TransferAgent TransferAgent Receiver UserAgent UserAgent 1:Mail 2:Message 3:Final submission transfer delivery Figure7-7. Architecture oftheemailsystem. The user agent is a program that provides a graphical interface, or sometimes atext- andcommand-based interfacethat lets users interact withtheemail system. It includes a means to compose messages and replies to messages, display incom- ing messages, and organize messages by filing, searching, and discarding them. The act of sending new messages into the mail system for delivery is called mail submission. Some of the user agent processing may be done automatically, anticipating what the user wants. For example, incoming mail may be filtered to extract or SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 625 deprioritize messages that are likely spam. Some user agents include advanced features, such as arranging for automatic email responses (‘‘I’m having a wonder- ful vacation and it will be a while before I get back to you’’). A user agent runs on the same computer on which a user reads her mail. It is just another program andmayberunonlysome ofthetime. The message transfer agents are typically system processes. They run in the background on mail server machines and are intended to be always available. Their jobistoautomatically moveemail throughthe system fromthe originator to the recipient with SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This is the message transfer step. SMTP was originally specified as RFC 821and revised to become the current RFC 5321. It sends mail over connections and reports back the delivery status and any errors. Numerous applications exist in which confirmation of delivery is important and may even have legal significance (‘‘Well, Your Honor, my email system is just not very reliable, so I guess the electronic subpoena just got lost somewhere’’). Message transfer agents also implement mailing lists, in which an identical copy of a message is delivered to everyone onalist ofemail addresses. Other ad- vanced features are carbon copies, blind carbon copies, high-priority email, secret (i.e., encrypted) email, alternative recipients if the primary one is not currently available, andtheabilityforassistants toread andanswer their bosses’email', 'Linking user agents and message transfer agents are the concepts of mail- boxes and a standard format for email messages. Mailboxes store the email that is received for a user. They are maintained by mail servers. User agents simply present users with a view of the contents of their mailboxes. To do this, the user agents send the mail servers commands to manipulate the mailboxes, inspecting their contents, deleting messages, and so on. The retrieval of mail is the final de- livery (step 3) in Fig.7-7. With this architecture, one user may use different user agents onmultiplecomputers toaccessonemailbox. Mail is sent between message transfer agents in a standard format. The origi- nal format, RFC 822,has been revised tothe current RFC 5322and extended with support for multimedia content and international text. This scheme is called MIME and will be discussed later. People still refer toInternet email as RFC 822, though. A key idea in the message format is the distinction between the envelope and its contents. The envelope encapsulates the message. It contains all the infor- mation needed fortransporting themessage, suchas the destination address, prior- ity, and security level, all of which are distinct from the message itself. The mes- sage transport agents usetheenvelope forrouting,justasthepostoffice does. The message inside the envelope consists of two separate parts: the header and the body. The header contains control information for the user agents. The body is entirely for the human recipient. None of the agents care much about it. Envelopes andmessages are illustratedinFig.7-8. 626 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Name:Mr.DanielDumkopf Street:18WillowLane City:WhitePlains Mr.DanielDumkopf Envelope State:NY 18WillowLane Zipcode:10604 WhitePlains,NY10604 Priority:Urgent Encryption:None From:UnitedGizmo UnitedGizmo Address:180MainSt. 180MainSt Location:Boston,MA02120 Boston,MA02120 Date:Sept.1,2010 Sept.1,2010 Subject:Invoice1081 Subject:Invoice1081 DearMr.Dumkopf, DearMr.Dumkopf, Ourcomputerrecords Ourcomputerrecords showthatyoustillhave showthatyoustillhave Message notpaidtheaboveinvoice notpaidtheaboveinvoice of$0.00.Pleasesendusa of$0.00.Pleasesendusa checkfor$0.00promptly. checkfor$0.00promptly.

We will examine the pieces of this architecture in more detail by looking at the steps that are involvedinsending email from oneuser toanother. Thisjourney starts withtheuseragent. 7.2.2 The User Agent A user agent is a program (sometimes called an email reader) that accepts a variety of commands for composing, receiving, and replying to messages, as well as for manipulating mailboxes. There are many popular user agents, including Google gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Apple Mail. They can vary greatly in their appearance. Most user agents have a menu- or icon- driven graphical interface that requires a mouse, or a touch interface on smaller mobile devices. Older user agents, such as Elm, mh, and Pine, provide text-based interfaces and expect one-character commands from the keyboard. Functionally, these are thesame, atleast fortextmessages. The typical elements of a user agent interface are shown in Fig.7-9. Your mail reader is likely to be much flashier, but probably has equivalent functions. SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 627 When a user agent is started, it will usually present a summary of the messages in the user’s mailbox. Often, the summary will have one line for each message in some sorted order. It highlights key fields of the message that are extracted from themessage envelope orheader', 'Messagefolders Messagesummary MailFolders From Subject Received Allitems trudy NotallTrudysarenasty Today Inbox Andy MaterialonRFIDprivacy Today Networks djw !

Typicalelementsoftheuseragentinterface. Seven summary lines are shown in the example of Fig.7-9. The lines use the From,Subject,and Receivedfields, inthat order, todisplay whosentthemessage, what it is about, and when it was received. All the information is formatted in a user-friendly way rather than displaying the literal contents of the message fields, but it is based on the message fields. Thus, people who fail to include a Subject field often discover that responses to their emails tend notto get the highest prior- ity. Many other fields or indications are possible. The icons next to the message subjects in Fig.7-9 might indicate, for example, unread mail (the envelope), at- tached material (the paperclip), andimportant mail, at least as judged bythe send- er(the exclamation point). Many sorting orders are also possible. The most common is to order messages based on the time that they were received, most recent first, with some indication as to whether the message is new or has already been read by the user. The fields in the summary and the sort order can be customized by the user according to her preferences. User agents must also be able to display incoming messages as needed so that people can read their email. Often a short preview of a message is provided, as in Fig.7-9, to help users decide when to read further. Previews may use small icons or images to describe the contents of the message. Other presentation processing 628 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 includes reformatting messages to fit the display, and translating or converting contents tomore convenientformats (e.g., digitizedspeechtorecognizedtext). After a message has been read, the user can decide what to do with it. This is called message disposition. Options include deleting the message, sending a reply, forwarding the message to another user, and keeping the message for later reference. Most user agents can manage one mailbox for incoming mail with multiple folders for saved mail. The folders allow the user to save message accordingtosender, topic,orsome othercategory. Filing can be done automatically by the user agent as well, before the user reads the messages. A common example is that the fields and contents of mes- sages are inspected and used, along with feedback from the user about previous messages, to determine if a message is likely to be spam. Many ISPs and com- panies run software that labels mail as important or spam so that the user agent can file it in the corresponding mailbox. The ISP and company have the advan- tage ofseeing mailformanyusersandmayhavelists ofknownspammers. Ifhun- dreds of users have just received a similar message, it is probably spam. By presorting incoming mailas‘‘probably legitimate’’and‘‘probably spam,’’the user agent can save users a fair amount of work separating the good stuff from the junk', 'And the most popular spam? It is generated by collections of compromised computers called botnets and its content depends on where you live. Fake diplo- mas are topical in Asia, and cheap drugs and other dubiousproduct offers are top- ical inthe U.S. Unclaimed Nigerian bankaccountsstillabound.Pillsforenlarging variousbodyparts are commoneverywhere. Other filing rules can be constructed byusers. Each rule specifies a condition and an action. For example, a rule could say that any message received from the boss goes to one folder for immediate reading and any message from a particular mailing list goes to another folder for later reading. Several folders are shown in Fig.7-9. The most important folders are the Inbox, for incoming mail not filed elsewhere, andJunkMail, formessages thatare thoughttobespam. As well as explicit constructs like folders, user agents now provide rich capa- bilities tosearch the mailbox. This feature is also shown inFig.7-9. Search capa- bilities let users find messages quickly, such as the message about ‘‘where to buy Vegemite’’thatsomeone sentinthelast month. Email has come a long way from the days when it was just file transfer. Pro- viders nowroutinely supportmailboxeswithupto1GB ofstoredmail thatdetails a user’s interactions over a long period of time. The sophisticated mail handling of user agents with search and automatic forms of processing is what makes it possible to manage these large volumes of email. For people who send and re- ceive thousandsofmessages ayear, these toolsare invaluable. Another useful feature is the ability to automatically respond to messages in some way. One response is to forward incoming email to a different address, for example, a computer operated by a commercial paging service that pages the user SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 629 byusing radio or satellite and displays the Subject:line onhispager. These auto- responders must run inthe mail server because the user agent may notrun all the time and may only occasionally retrieve email. Because of these factors, the user agent cannot provide a true automatic response. However, the interface for automatic responsesisusually presented bytheuseragent. A different example of an automatic response is a vacation agent. This is a program that examines each incoming message and sends the sender an insipid reply such as: ‘‘Hi. I’m on vacation. I’ll be back on the 24th of August. Talk to you then.’’ Such replies can also specify how to handle urgent matters in the interim, other people to contact for specific problems, etc. Most vacation agents keep track of whom they have sent canned replies to and refrain from sending the same person a second reply. There are pitfalls with these agents, however. For example, itisnotadvisable tosendacanned replytoalarge mailinglist. Let usnowturn tothe scenario of one user sending a message to another user. One of the basic features user agents support that we have not yet discussed is mail composition. It involves creating messages and answers to messages and sending these messages into the rest of the mail system for delivery', 'Although any text editor can be used to create the body of the message, editors are usually integrated with the user agent sothat itcan provide assistance withaddressing and thenumerous header fields attached toeachmessage. Forexample, when answer- ing a message, the email system can extract the originator’s address from the in- coming email and automatically insert it into the proper place in the reply. Other common features are appending a signature block to the bottom of a message, correcting spelling, and computing digital signatures that show the message is valid. Messages that are sent into the mail system have a standard format that must be created from the information supplied to the user agent. The most important part ofthe message fortransfer isthe envelope, and the most important part of the envelope is the destination address. This address must be in a format that the message transfer agents can deal with. The expected form of an address is user@dns-address. Since we studied DNS earlier in this chapter, we will not repeat that material here. However, it is worth noting that other forms of addressing exist. In particular, X.400 addresses lookradically different fromDNSaddresses. X.400isanISO standard formessage-handling systems that was at onetime a competitortoSMTP. SMTP wonouthandily, thoughX.400systems are stillused, mostly outside of the U.S. X.400 addresses are composed of attribute=value pairsseparated byslashes, forexample, /C=US/ST=MASSACHUSETTS/L=CAMBRIDGE/PA=360MEMORIALDR./CN=KEN SMITH/ This address specifies a country, state, locality, personal address, and common name (Ken Smith). Many other attributes are possible, so you can send email to 630 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 someone whose exact email address youdonot know, provided youknow enough other attributes (e.g., company andjobtitle). AlthoughX.400names are considerably less convenient than DNS names, the issue is moot for user agents because they have user-friendly aliases (sometimes called nicknames) that allow users to enter or select a person’s name and get the correct email address. Consequently, it isusually notnecessarytoactually typein these strange strings. Afinal pointwewilltouchonforsendingmail ismailinglists, whichletusers send the same message to a list of people with a single command. There are two choices for how the mailing list is maintained. It might be maintained locally, by the user agent. In this case, the user agent can just send a separate message to eachintended recipient. Alternatively, the list may be maintained remotely at a message transfer agent. Messages will then be expanded in the message transfer system, which has the effect ofallowing multipleusers tosend to the list. For example, if a groupof bird watchers has a mailing list called birders installed on the transfer agent meadowlark.arizona.edu, any message sent to birders@meadowlark.arizona.edu willbe routed tothe University ofArizona andexpanded intoindividual messages to all the mailing list members, wherever in the world they may be. Users of this mailing list cannot tell that itisamailinglist. Itcould justas well be the personal mailboxofProf.Gabriel O.Birders. 7.2.3 Message Formats Now we turn from the user interface to the format of the email messages themselves. Messages sent by the user agent must be placed in a standard format to be handled by the message transfer agents', 'First we will look at basic ASCII email using RFC 5322, which is the latest revision of the original Internet mes- sage format as described in RFC 822. After that, we will look at multimedia ex- tensions tothebasic format. RFC 5322—TheInternet Message Format Messages consist of a primitive envelope (described as part of SMTP in RFC 5321), some number of header fields, a blank line, and then the message body. Each header field (logically) consists of a single line of ASCII text containing the field name, a colon, and, for most fields, a value. The original RFC 822 was de- signed decades ago and did not clearly distinguish the envelope fields from the header fields. Although it has been revised to RFC 5322, completely redoing it was not possible due to its widespread usage. In normal usage, the user agent builds a message and passes it to the message transfer agent, which then uses some of the header fields to construct the actual envelope, a somewhat old- fashioned mixingofmessage andenvelope. SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 631 The principal header fields related tomessage transport are listed in Fig.7-10. The To: field gives the DNS address oftheprimary recipient. Havingmultiplere- cipients isalsoallowed. The Cc:field givesthe addresses ofany secondaryrecip- ients. In terms of delivery, there is no distinction between the primary and sec- ondary recipients. It is entirely a psychological difference that may be important tothe people involvedbutisnotimportant tothemail system. The term Cc:(Car- boncopy)isabitdated, since computers donotusecarbonpaper, butit iswell es- tablished. The Bcc: (Blind carboncopy)field islike the Cc: field, except that this line is deleted from all the copies sent to the primary and secondary recipients. This feature allows people to send copies to third parties without the primary and secondaryrecipients knowingthis.

RFC5322headerfieldsrelatedtomessagetransport. The next two fields, From: and Sender:, tell who wrote and sent the message, respectively. These need not be the same. For example, a business executive may write a message, but her assistant may be the one who actually transmits it. In this case, the executive would be listed in the From: field and the assistant in the Sender: field. The From: field is required, but the Sender: field may be omit- ted if it is the same as the From: field. These fields are needed in case the mes- sage isundeliverableandmustbereturned tothesender. Alinecontaining Received:isadded byeach message transfer agent alongthe way. The line contains the agent’s identity,the date and time the message was re- ceived, andother information thatcan beusedfordebuggingtheroutingsystem. The Return-Path: field is added by the final message transfer agent and was intended to tell how to get back to the sender. In theory, this information can be gathered from all the Received:headers (except forthe name ofthe sender’s mail- box), but it is rarely filled in as such and typically just contains the sender’s ad- dress. In addition to the fields of Fig.7-10, RFC 5322 messages may also contain a variety of header fields used by the user agents or human recipients', 'The most common ones are listed in Fig. 7-11. Most of these are self-explanatory, so we willnotgointoalloftheminmuchdetail. 632 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Header Meaning Date: Thedateandtimethemessagewassent Reply-To: Emailaddresstowhichrepliesshouldbesent Message-Id: Uniquenumberforreferencingthismessagelater In-Reply-To: Message-Idofthemessagetowhichthisisareply References: OtherrelevantMessage-Ids Keywords: User-chosenkeywords Subject: Shortsummaryofthemessagefortheone-linedisplay Figure7-11. SomefieldsusedintheRFC5322messageheader. The Reply-To: field issometimes used when neither the person composing the message nor the person sending the message wants to see the reply. For example, a marketing manager may write an email message telling customers about a new product. The message issent byanassistant, butthe Reply-To: field liststhehead of the sales department, who can answer questions and take orders. This field is also useful when the sender has two email accounts and wants the reply to go to theother one. The Message-Id: is an automatically generated number that is used to link messages together (e.g., whenusedintheIn-Reply-To: field) andtoprevent dupli- cate delivery. The RFC 5322 document explicitly says that users are allowed to invent op- tional headers for their own private use. By convention since RFC 822, these headers start with the string X-. It is guaranteed that no future headers will use names starting with X-, to avoid conflicts between official and private headers. Sometimes wiseguy undergraduates make up fields like X-Fruit-of-the-Day: or X-Disease-of-the-Week:,whichare legal, althoughnotalways illuminating. After theheaders comes the message body. Users can putwhatever they want here. Some people terminate their messages with elaborate signatures, including quotations from greater and lesser authorities, political statements, and disclai- mers of all kinds (e.g., The XYZ Corporation is not responsible for my opinions; infact, itcannoteven comprehend them). MIME—The Multipurpose Internet MailExtensions In the early days of the ARPANET, email consisted exclusively of text mes- sages written in English and expressed in ASCII. For this environment, the early RFC 822 format did the job completely: it specified the headers but left the con- tent entirely up to the users. In the 1990s, the worldwide use of the Internet and demand to send richer content through the mail system meant that this approach was no longer adequate. The problems included sending and receiving messages SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 633 in languages with accents (e.g., French and German), non-Latin alphabets (e.g., Hebrew and Russian), or no alphabets (e.g., Chinese and Japanese), as well as sending messages not containing text at all (e.g., audio, images, or binary docu- ments andprograms). The solution was the development of MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). It is widely used for mail messages that are sent across the Internet, as well as to describe content for other applications such as Web browsing. MIMEisdescribed inRFCs 2045–2047,4288,4289,and2049. The basic idea ofMIME istocontinue touse the RFC 822format (the precur- sor to RFC 5322 the time MIME was proposed) but to add structure to the mes- sage bodyand define encoding rules for the transfer of non-ASCII messages. Not deviating from RFC 822 allowed MIME messages to be sent using the existing mail transfer agents and protocols (based on RFC 821 then, and RFC 5321 now). All that had to be changed were the sending and receiving programs, which users coulddoforthemselves', 'MIME defines five new message headers, as shown in Fig. 7-12. The first of these simply tells the user agent receiving the message that it is dealing with a MIME message, and which version of MIME it uses. Any message not con- taining a MIME-Version: header is assumed to be an English plaintext message (oratleast oneusingonlyASCII characters) andisprocessed assuch. Header Meaning MIME-Version: IdentifiestheMIMEversion Content-Description: Human-readablestringtellingwhatisinthemessage Content-Id: Uniqueidentifier Content-Transfer-Encoding: Howthebodyiswrappedfortransmission Content-Type: Typeandformatofthecontent Figure7-12. MessageheadersaddedbyMIME. The Content-Description: header isanASCII stringtellingwhat isinthe mes- sage. This header is needed so the recipient will know whether it is worth decod- ing and reading the message. If the string says ‘‘Photo of Barbara’s hamster’’ and the person gettingthe message is nota bighamster fan, the message willprobably bediscarded rather thandecoded intoahigh-resolution color photograph. The Content-Id: header identifies the content. It uses the same format as the standard Message-Id: header. The Content-Transfer-Encoding: tells how the body is wrapped for transmis- sion through the network. A key problem at the time MIME was developed was that the mail transfer (SMTP) protocols expected ASCII messages in which no line exceeded 1000 characters. ASCII characters use 7 bits out of each 8-bit byte. Binary data such as executable programs and images use all 8bits ofeach byte, as 634 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 do extended character sets. There was no guarantee this data would be transferred safely. Hence, some method of carrying binary data that made it look like a regu- lar ASCII mail message was needed. Extensions to SMTP since the development of MIME do allow 8-bit binary data to be transferred, though even today binary data maynotalways gothroughthemail systemcorrectly ifunencoded. MIME provides five transfer encoding schemes, plus an escape to new schemes—just in case. The simplest scheme is just ASCII text messages. ASCII characters use 7 bits and can be carried directly by the email protocol, provided thatnolineexceeds1000characters. The next simplest scheme is the same thing, but using 8-bit characters, that is, all values from 0 up to and including 255 are allowed. Messages using the 8-bit encoding muststilladhere tothestandard maximum linelength. Then there are messages that use a true binary encoding. These are arbitrary binary files that notonlyuse all 8bitsbutalso donotadhere tothe1000-character line limit. Executable programs fall into this category. Nowadays, mail servers can negotiate to send data in binary (or 8-bit) encoding, falling back to ASCII if bothendsdonotsupporttheextension. The ASCII encoding of binary data is called base64 encoding. In this scheme, groups of 24 bits are broken up into four 6-bit units, with each unit being sent as a legal ASCII character. The coding is ‘‘A’’ for 0, ‘‘B’’ for 1, and so on, followed by the 26 lowercase letters, the 10 digits, and finally + and / for 62 and 63, respectively. The == and = sequences indicate that the last group contained only 8 or 16 bits, respectively. Carriage returns and line feeds are ignored, so they can be inserted at will in the encoded character stream tokeep the lines short enough. Arbitrary binary text can be sent safely using this scheme, albeit ineffi- ciently', 'This encoding was very popular before binary-capable mail servers were widely deployed. Itisstillcommonly seen. For messages that are almost entirely ASCII but with a few non-ASCII char- acters, base64 encoding is somewhat inefficient. Instead, an encoding known as quoted-printable encoding is used. This is just 7-bit ASCII, with all the charac- ters above 127encoded as an equals sign followed bythe character’s value as two hexadecimal digits. Control characters, some punctuation marks and math symb- ols,aswell astrailingspacesare alsosoencoded. Finally, when there are valid reasons not to use one of these schemes, it is possible to specify a user-defined encoding in the Content-Transfer-Encoding: header. The last header shown in Fig.7-12 is really the most interesting one. It speci- fies the nature of the message bodyand has had an impact well beyond email. For instance, content downloaded from the Web is labeled with MIME types so that the browser knows how topresent it. So iscontent sent over streaming media and real-time transports suchasvoice overIP. Initially,seven MIME types were defined inRFC 1521. Each type has one or more available subtypes. The type and subtype are separated by a slash, as in SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 635 ‘‘Content-Type: video/mpeg’’. Since then,hundredsofsubtypeshave been added, along with another type. Additional entries are being added all the time as new types of content are developed. The list of assigned types and subtypes is main- tained onlinebyIANAatwww.iana.org/assignments/media-types. The types, along with examples of commonly used subtypes, are given in Fig.7-13. Let us briefly go through them, starting with text. The text/plain com- bination is for ordinary messages that can be displayed as received, with no en- coding and no further processing. This option allows ordinary messages to be transported in MIME with only a few extra headers. The text/html subtype was added when the Web became popular (in RFC 2854) to allow Web pages to be sent in RFC 822email. A subtype for the eXtensible Markup Language, text/xml, is defined in RFC 3023. XML documents have proliferated with the development oftheWeb. We willstudyHTML andXMLinSec. 7.3.

MIMEcontenttypesandexamplesubtypes. The next MIME type is image, which is used to transmit still pictures. Many formats are widely used for storing and transmitting images nowadays, both with and without compression. Several of these, including GIF, JPEG, and TIFF, are built into nearly all browsers. Many other formats and corresponding subtypes exist aswell. The audio and video types are for sound and moving pictures, respectively. Please note that video may include only the visual information, not the sound. If a movie with sound is tobe transmitted, the video and audio portions may have to betransmittedseparately, depending ontheencoding system used. Thefirst video format defined was the one devised by the modestly named Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), but others have been added since. In addition to audio/basic,a new audio type, audio/mpeg,was added in RFC 3003 to allow peo- ple to email MP3 audio files', 'The video/mp4 and audio/mp4 types signal video andaudiodata thatare storedinthenewer MPEG4format. The model type was added after the other content types. It is intended for describing 3Dmodeldata. However, ithasnotbeen widely usedtodate. 636 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 The application type is a catchall for formats that are not covered by one of the other types and that require an application to interpret the data. We have lis- ted the subtypes pdf, javascript, and zip as examples for PDF documents, Java- Script programs, and Zip archives, respectively. User agents that receive this con- tent use a third-party library or external program to display the content; the dis- playmayormaynotappear tobeintegrated withtheuseragent. By using MIME types, user agents gain the extensibility to handle new types ofapplication content asitisdeveloped. Thisisasignificant benefit. Ontheother hand, many of the new forms of content are executed or interpreted by applica- tions, which presents some dangers. Obviously, running an arbitrary executable program that has arrived via the mail system from ‘‘friends’’ poses a security haz- ard. The program may doall sorts ofnasty damage tothe parts ofthecomputer to which it has access, especially if it can read and write files and use the network. Less obviously, document formats can pose the same hazards. This is because formats such as PDF are full-blown programming languages in disguise. While they are interpreted and restricted in scope, bugs in the interpreter often allow deviousdocuments toescape therestrictions. Besides these examples, there are many more application subtypes because there are many more applications. Asafallback tobeusedwhennoother subtype is known to be more fitting, the octet-stream subtype denotes a sequence of unin- terpreted bytes. Upon receiving such a stream, it is likely that a user agent will display it by suggesting to the user that it be copied to a file. Subsequent proc- essingisthenuptotheuser, whopresumably knowswhat kindofcontent itis. The last twotypes are useful forcomposing andmanipulating messages them- selves. The message type allows one message to be fully encapsulated inside an- other. This scheme is useful for forwarding email, for example. When a com- plete RFC 822 message is encapsulated inside an outer message, the rfc822 sub- type should be used. Similarly, it is common for HTML documents to be encap- sulated. And the partial subtype makes it possible to break an encapsulated mes- sage into pieces and send them separately (for example, if the encapsulated mes- sage is too long). Parameters make it possible to reassemble all the parts at the destination inthecorrect order. Finally, the multipart type allows a message to contain more than one part, with the beginning and end of each part being clearly delimited. The mixed sub- type allows each part to be a different type, with no additional structure imposed. Many email programs allow the user to provide one or more attachments to a text message. These attachments are sentusingthemultiparttype. In contrast to mixed, the alternative subtype allows the same message to be included multiple times but expressed in two or more different media. For ex- ample, amessage couldbesentinplain ASCII, inHMTL, andinPDF', 'Aproperly designed user agent getting such a message would display it according to user preferences. Likely PDF would be the first choice, if that is possible. The second choice would be HTML. If neither of these were possible, then the flat ASCII SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 637 text would be displayed. The parts should be ordered from simplest to most com- plex to help recipients with pre-MIME user agents make some sense of the mes- sage (e.g., even apre-MIME usercan read flat ASCII text). The alternative subtype can also be used for multiple languages. In this con- text, the Rosetta Stone can be thought of as an early multipart/alternative mes- sage. Of the other twoexample subtypes, the parallel subtype isused when all parts must be ‘‘viewed’’ simultaneously. For example, movies often have an audio channel and a video channel. Movies are more effective if these two channels are played back inparallel, instead ofconsecutively. The digest subtypeisusedwhen multiple messages are packed together into a composite message. For example, some discussion groups on the Internet collect messages from subscribers and thensendthemouttothegroupperiodically asasingle multipart/digestmessage. As an example of how MIME types may be used for email messages, a multi- media message is shown in Fig. 7-14. Here, a birthday greeting is transmitted in alternative forms as HTML and as an audio file. Assuming the receiver has audio capability, the user agent there willplay the soundfile. In this example, the sound is carried by reference as a message/external-body subtype, so first the user agent must fetch the sound file birthday.snd using FTP. If the user agent has no audio capability, the lyrics are displayed on the screen in stony silence. The two parts are delimited by two hyphens followed by a (software-generated) string specified intheboundaryparameter. Note that the Content-Type header occurs in three positions within this ex- ample. At the top level, it indicates that the message has multiple parts. Within each part, it gives the type and subtype of that part. Finally, within the body of the second part, it is required to tell the user agent what kind of external file it is to fetch. To indicate this slight difference in usage, we have used lowercase let- ters here, although all headers are case insensitive. The Content-Transfer-En- coding is similarly required for any external body that is not encoded as 7-bit ASCII. 7.2.4 Message Transfer Now that we have described user agents and mail messages, we are ready to look at how the message transfer agents relay messages from the originator to the recipient. The mail transfer isdonewiththeSMTP protocol. The simplest way to move messages is to establish a transport connection fromthesource machine tothedestination machine andthenjusttransfer themes- sage. This is how SMTP originally worked. Over the years, however, two dif- ferent uses of SMTP have been differentiated. The first use is mail submission, step 1 in the email architecture of Fig.7-7. This is the means by which user agents send messages into the mail system for delivery. The second use is to transfer messages between message transfer agents (step 2 in Fig.7-7)', 'This 638 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 From:alice@cs.washington.edu To:bob@ee.uwa.edu.au MIME-Version:1.0 Message-Id:<0704760941.AA00747@cs.washington.edu> Content-Type:multipart/alternative; boundary=qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm Subject:Earthorbitssunintegralnumberoftimes Thisisthepreamble.Theuseragentignoresit.Haveaniceday. --qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm Content-Type:text/html <p>Happybirthdaytoyou<br> Happybirthdaytoyou<br> Happybirthdaydear<b>Bob</b><br> Happybirthdaytoyou</p> --qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm Content-Type:message/external-body; access-type=\"anon-ftp\"; site=\"bicycle.cs.washington.edu\"; directory=\"pub\"; name=\"birthday.snd\" content-type:audio/basic content-transfer-encoding:base64 --qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm-- Figure7-14. AmultipartmessagecontainingHTMLandaudioalternatives. sequence delivers mail all the way from the sending to the receiving message transfer agent in one hop. Final delivery is accomplished with different protocols thatwewilldescribe inthenextsection. In this section, we will describe the basics of the SMTP protocol and its ex- tension mechanism. Then we will discuss how it is used differently for mail sub- missionandmessage transfer. SMTP (Simple MailTransfer Protocol) andExtensions Within the Internet, email is delivered by having the sending computer estab- lish a TCP connection to port 25 of the receiving computer. Listening to this port is a mail server that speaks SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This ser- ver accepts incoming connections, subject to some security checks, and accepts messages for delivery. If a message cannot be delivered, an error report con- taining thefirstpart oftheundeliverablemessage isreturned tothesender. SMTP is a simple ASCII protocol. This is not a weakness but a feature. Using ASCII text makes protocols easy to develop, test, and debug. They can be SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 639 tested by sending commands manually, and records of the messages are easy to read. Mostapplication-level Internet protocols nowworkthisway(e.g., HTTP). We willwalk throughasimple message transfer between mail servers that de- livers a message. After establishing the TCP connection to port 25, the sending machine, operating as the client, waits for the receiving machine, operating as the server, to talk first. The server starts by sending a line of text giving its identity and telling whether it is prepared to receive mail. If it is not, the client releases theconnectionandtries again later. If the server is willing to accept email, the client announces whom the email is coming from and whom it is going to. If such a recipient exists at the destina- tion, the server gives the client the go-ahead to send the message. Then the client sends the message and the server acknowledges it. No checksums are needed be- cause TCP provides a reliable byte stream. If there is more email, that is now sent. When all the email has been exchanged in bothdirections, the connection is released. A sample dialog for sending the message of Fig.7-14, including the numerical codes used by SMTP, is shown in Fig. 7-15. The lines sent by the cli- ent (i.e., the sender) are marked C:. Those sent by the server (i.e., the receiver) are marked S:. The first command from the client is indeed meant to be HELO. Of the vari- ous four-character abbreviations for HELLO, this one has numerous advantages over its biggest competitor. Why all the commands had to be four characters has been lostinthemists oftime. In Fig. 7-15, the message is sent to only one recipient, so only one RCPT command isused. Such commands are allowed tosend asingle message tomulti- ple receivers. Each one is individually acknowledged or rejected. Even if some recipients are rejected (because they do not exist at the destination), the message can besenttotheotherones', 'Finally, althoughthe syntax ofthe four-character commands from the client is rigidly specified, the syntax of the replies is less rigid. Only the numerical code really counts. Each implementation can put whatever string it wants after the code. The basic SMTP works well, but it is limited in several respects. It does not include authentication. Thismeans that theFROM command intheexample could give any sender address that it pleases. This is quite useful for sending spam. An- other limitation is that SMTP transfers ASCII messages, not binary data. This is why the base64 MIME content transfer encoding was needed. However, with that encoding the mail transmission uses bandwidth inefficiently, which is an issue for large messages. A third limitation is that SMTP sends messages in the clear. It hasnoencryption toprovide ameasure ofprivacy against pryingeyes. To allow these and many other problems related to message processing to be addressed, SMTP was revised to have an extension mechanism. This mechanism is a mandatory part of the RFC 5321 standard. The use of SMTP with extensions iscalled ESMTP (Extended SMTP). 640 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 S:220ee.uwa.edu.auSMTPserviceready C:HELOabcd.com S:250cs.washington.edusayshellotoee.uwa.edu.au C:MAILFROM:<alice@cs.washington.edu> S:250senderok C:RCPTTO:<bob@ee.uwa.edu.au> S:250recipientok C:DATA S:354Sendmail;endwith\".\"onalinebyitself C:From:alice@cs.washington.edu C:To:bob@ee.uwa.edu.au C:MIME-Version:1.0 C:Message-Id:<0704760941.AA00747@ee.uwa.edu.au> C:Content-Type:multipart/alternative; boundary=qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm C:Subject:Earthorbitssunintegralnumberoftimes C: C:Thisisthepreamble.Theuseragentignoresit.Haveaniceday.

Clients wanting to use an extension send an EHLO message instead of HELO initially. If this is rejected, the server is a regular SMTP server, and the client should proceed in the usual way. If the EHLO is accepted, the server replies with the extensions that it supports. The client may then use any of these extensions. Several commonextensions are showninFig.7-16. The figure gives the keyword SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 641 as used in the extension mechanism, along with a description of the new func- tionality. We willnotgointoextensions infurther detail.

SomeSMTPextensions. To get a better feel for how SMTP and some of the other protocols described in this chapter work, try them out. In all cases, first go to a machine connected to theInternet. OnaUNIX (orLinux)system, inashell, type telnet mail.isp.com 25 substitutingthe DNS name of your ISP’s mail server for mail.isp.com. On a Win- dows XP system, click on Start, then Run, and type the command in the dialog box. On a Vista or Windows 7 machine, you may have to first install the telnet program (or equivalent) and then start it yourself. This command will establish a telnet (i.e., TCP) connection to port 25 on that machine. Port 25 is the SMTP port; see Fig. 6-34 for the ports for other common protocols.

In this setting, all that is required to send a message is for the user agent to talk to the local mail server, using the dialog that we have just described. However, thissettingisnolongertheusualcase. 642 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 User agents often runonlaptops, homePCs, and mobile phones. They are not always connected to the Internet. Mail transfer agents run on ISP and company servers. They are always connected to the Internet. This difference means that a user agent in Boston may need to contact its regular mail server in Seattle to send amailmessage becausetheuseristraveling. By itself, this remote communication poses no problem. It is exactly what the TCP/IP protocols are designed to support. However, an ISP or company usually does not want any remote user to be able to submit messages to its mail server to be delivered elsewhere. The ISP or company is not running the server as a public service. In addition, this kind of open mail relay attracts spammers. This is be- cause it provides a way to launder the original sender and thus make the message more difficult toidentify asspam. Given these considerations, SMTP is normally used for mail submission with the AUTH extension. This extension lets the server check the credentials (user- name and password) of the client to confirm that the server should be providing mail service. There are several other differences in the way SMTP is used for mail submis- sion. For example, port 587 is used in preference to port 25 and the SMTP server can check and correct the format of the messages sent by the user agent. For more information about the restricted use of SMTP for mail submission, please see RFC4409. Message Transfer Once the sending mail transfer agent receives a message from the user agent, it will deliver it to the receiving mail transfer agent using SMTP. To do this, the sender uses the destination address. Consider the message in Fig. 7-15, addressed tobob@ee.uwa.edu.au. Towhatmail server shouldthemessage bedelivered? To determine the correct mail server to contact, DNS is consulted. In the pre- vious section, we described how DNS contains multiple types of records, includ- ing the MX, or mail exchanger, record. In this case, a DNS query is made for the MX records of the domain ee.uwa.edu.au. This query returns an ordered list of the names andIPaddresses ofoneormore mail servers. The sending mail transfer agent then makes a TCP connection on port 25 to the IP address of the mail server to reach the receiving mail transfer agent, and usesSMTP torelay the message. The receivingmail transfer agent willthen place mail for the user bob in the correct mailbox for Bob to read it at a later time. This local delivery step may involve moving the message among computers if there is alarge mail infrastructure. With this delivery process, mail travels from the initial to the final mail trans- fer agent inasinglehop.There are nointermediate servers inthemessage transfer stage', 'It is possible, however, for this delivery process to occur multiple times. One example that we have described already is when a message transfer agent SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONICMAIL 643 implements amailinglist.Inthiscase, a message isreceivedfor the list. Itisthen expanded as a message to each member of the list that is sent to the individual member addresses. As another example of relaying, Bob may have graduated from M.I.T. and also be reachable via the address bob@alum.mit.edu. Rather than reading mail on multipleaccounts,Bobcan arrange formail senttothisaddress tobe forwarded to bob@ee.uwa.edu. In this case, mail sent to bob@alum.mit.edu will undergo two deliveries. First, itwillbe sent tothe mail server foralum.mit.edu.Then, itwill be sent to the mail server for ee.uwa.edu.au. Each of these legs is a complete and separate delivery asfarasthemail transfer agents are concerned. Another consideration nowadays isspam. Nine outoften messages sent today are spam (McAfee, 2010). Few people want more spam, but it is hard to avoid because it masquerades as regular mail. Before accepting a message, additional checks may be made to reduce the opportunities for spam. The message for Bob was sent from alice@cs.washington.edu. The receiving mail transfer agent can look up the sending mail transfer agent in DNS. This lets it check that the IP ad- dress of the other end of the TCP connection matches the DNS name. More gen- erally, the receiving agent may look upthe sending domain in DNS tosee ifithas a mail sending policy. This information is often given in the TXT and SPF records. It may indicate that other checks can be made. For example, mail sent fromcs.washington.edu mayalways besentfromthe hostjune.cs.washington.edu. Ifthesendingmailtransfer agent isnotjune,there isaproblem. Ifanyofthese checks fail, the mail is probably being forged with a fake send- ing address. In this case, it is discarded. However, passing these checks does not imply that mail is not spam. The checks merely ensure that the mail seems to be coming from the region of the network that it purports to come from. The idea is that spammers shouldbeforced touse the correct sending address when they send mail. Thismakes spameasier torecognizeanddelete whenitisunwanted. 7.2.5 Final Delivery Our mail message is almost delivered. It has arrived at Bob’s mailbox. All that remains is to transfer a copy of the message to Bob’s user agent for display. This is step 3 in the architecture of Fig.7-7. This task was straightforward in the early Internet, when the user agent and mail transfer agent ran on the same ma- chine as different processes. The mail transfer agent simply wrote new messages to the end of the mailbox file, and the user agent simply checked the mailbox file fornewmail. Nowadays, the user agent on a PC, laptop, or mobile, is likely to be on a dif- ferent machine than the ISP or company mail server. Users want to be able to ac- cess their mailremotely, fromwherever theyare. They want toaccessemail from work, from their home PCs, from their laptops when on business trips, and from cybercafes whenonso-called vacation. They also want tobeable towork offline, 644 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP', '7 then reconnect to receive incoming mail and send outgoing mail. Moreover, each user may run several user agents depending on what computer it is convenient to useatthemoment. Several useragents mayeven berunningatthesame time. In this setting, the job of the user agent is to present a view of the contents of the mailbox, and to allow the mailbox to be remotely manipulated. Several dif- ferent protocols can beused forthispurpose, butSMTP isnotoneofthem. SMTP is a push-based protocol. It takes a message and connects to a remote server to transfer the message. Final delivery cannot be achieved in this manner both be- cause the mailbox must continue to be stored on the mail transfer agent and be- cause the user agent may not be connected to the Internet at the moment that SMTP attempts torelay messages. IMAP—The Internet Message AccessProtocol One of the main protocols that is used for final delivery is IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol). Version 4 of the protocol is defined in RFC 3501. To use IMAP, the mail server runs an IMAP server that listens to port 143. The user agent runs an IMAP client. The client connects to the server and begins to issuecommands fromthoselisted inFig.7-17. First, the client will start a secure transport if one is to be used (in order to keep the messages and commands confidential), and then log in or otherwise authenticate itself to the server. Once logged in, there are many commands to list folders and messages, fetch messages or even parts of messages, mark messages with flags for later deletion, and organize messages into folders. To avoid confu- sion, please note that we use the term ‘‘folder’’ here to be consistent with the rest of the material in this section, in which a user has a single mailbox made up of multiple folders. However, in the IMAP specification, the term mailbox is used instead. OneuserthushasmanyIMAPmailboxes,eachofwhich istypically pres- ented totheuserasafolder. IMAP has many other features, too. It has the ability to address mail not by message number, but by using attributes (e.g., give me the first message from Alice). Searches can be performed on the server to find the messages that satisfy certain criteria sothatonlythosemessages are fetched bytheclient. IMAP is an improvement over an earlier final delivery protocol, POP3 (Post Office Protocol, version 3), which is specified in RFC 1939. POP3 is a simpler protocol but supports fewer features and is less secure in typical usage. Mail is usually downloaded to the user agent computer, instead of remaining on the mail server. Thismakes life easier ontheserver, butharder onthe user. It isnoteasy to read mail on multiple computers, plus if the user agent computer breaks, all email maybelostpermanently. Nonetheless, youwillstillfindPOP3 inuse. Proprietary protocols can also be used because the protocol runs between a mail server and user agent that can be supplied by the same company.

IMAP(version4)commands. Webmail An increasingly popular alternative to IMAP and SMTP for providing email service is to use the Web as an interface for sending and receiving mail. Widely used Webmail systems include Google Gmail, Microsoft Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail. Webmail is one example of software (in this case, a mail user agent) that is provided asaservice usingtheWeb. Inthisarchitecture, the provider runsmail servers as usual to accept messages for users with SMTP on port 25. However, the user agent is different. Instead of 646 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 being a standalone program, it is a user interface that is provided via Web pages. This means that users can use any browser they like to access their mail and send newmessages. We have not yet studied the Web, but a brief description that you might come back toisas follows. When the user goes tothe email Web page oftheprovider, a form is presented in which the user is asked for a login name and password. The login name and password are sent to the server, which then validates them. If the login is successful, the server finds the user’s mailboxand builds a Web page list- ingthe contents ofthe mailboxonthe fly. The Webpage isthensenttothebrow- serfordisplay. Many of the items on the page showing the mailbox are clickable, so mes- sages can be read, deleted, and so on. To make the interface responsive, the Web pages will often include JavaScript programs. These programs are run locally on the client in response to local events (e.g., mouse clicks) and can also download and upload messages in the background, to prepare the next message for display or a new message for submission. In this model, mail submission happens using thenormal Webprotocols byposting data toaURL. The Web server takes care of injecting messages into the traditional mail delivery system that we have de- scribed. For security, the standard Web protocols can be used as well. These pro- tocols concern themselves with encrypting Web pages, not whether the content of theWeb page isamail message. 7.3 THE WORLD WIDE WEB The Web, as the World Wide Web is popularly known, is an architectural framework for accessing linked content spread out over millions of machines all overtheInternet. In10years itwentfrombeingaway tocoordinate the design of high-energy physics experiments in Switzerland to the application that millions of people think of as being ‘‘The Internet.’’ Its enormous popularity stems from the fact that it is easy for beginners to use and provides access with a rich graphical interface to an enormous wealth of information on almost every conceivable sub- ject, fromaardvarks toZulus. The Web began in1989at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research', 'The initial idea was to help large teams, often with members in half a dozen or more countries and time zones, collaborate using a constantly changing collection of reports, blueprints, drawings, photos, and other documents produced by experi- ments inparticle physics. The proposalforaweb oflinked documents came from CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee. The first (text-based) prototype was opera- tional 18months later. A public demonstration given at the Hypertext ’91 confer- ence caught the attention of other researchers, which led Marc Andreessen at the University of Illinois to develop the first graphical browser. It was called Mosaic andreleased inFebruary 1993. SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 647 The rest, as they say, is now history. Mosaic was so popular that a year later Andreessen left to form a company, Netscape Communications Corp., whose goal was to develop Web software. For the next three years, Netscape Navigator and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer engaged in a ‘‘browser war,’’ each one trying to capture a larger share of the new market by frantically adding more features (and thusmore bugs)thantheother one. Through the 1990s and 2000s, Web sites and Web pages, as Web content is called, grew exponentially until there were millions of sites and billions of pages. A small number of these sites became tremendously popular. Those sites and the companies behind them largely define the Web as people experience it today. Ex- amples include: a bookstore (Amazon, started in 1994, market capitalization $50 billion), a flea market (eBay, 1995, $30B), search (Google, 1998, $150B), and social networking (Facebook, 2004, private company valued at more than $15B). The period through 2000, when many Web companies became worth hundreds of millions of dollars overnight, only to go bust practically the next day when they turned out to be hype, even has a name. It is called the dot com era. New ideas are still striking it rich on the Web. Many of them come from students. For ex- ample, Mark Zuckerberg was a Harvard student when he started Facebook, and Sergey Brin and Larry Page were students at Stanford when they started Google. Perhaps youwillcome upwiththenextbigthing. In 1994, CERN and M.I.T. signed an agreement setting up the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), an organization devoted tofurther developing the Web, standardizing protocols, and encouraging interoperability between sites. Berners- Lee became the director. Since then, several hundred universities and companies have joined the consortium. Although there are now more books about the Web than you can shake a stick at, the best place to get up-to-date information about the Web is (naturally) on the Web itself. The consortium’s home page is at www.w3.org. Interested readers are referred there for links to pages covering all oftheconsortium’s numerousdocuments andactivities. 7.3.1 Architectural Overview From the users’ point of view, the Web consists of a vast, worldwide collec- tion of content in the form of Web pages, often just called pages for short. Each page may contain links to other pages anywhere in the world. Users can follow a link by clicking on it, which then takes them to the page pointed to', 'This process can be repeated indefinitely. The idea of having one page point to another, now called hypertext, was invented by a visionary M.I.T. professor of electrical en- gineering, Vannevar Bush, in 1945 (Bush, 1945). This was long before the Inter- net was invented. In fact, it was before commercial computers existed although several universities had produced crude prototypes that filled large rooms and had lesspower thanamodern pocket calculator. 648 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Pages are generally viewed with a program called a browser. Firefox, Inter- net Explorer, andChrome are examples ofpopularbrowsers. The browser fetches the page requested, interprets the content, and displays the page, properly for- matted, on the screen. The content itself may be a mix of text, images, and for- matting commands, in the manner of a traditional document, or other forms of content such as video or programs that produce a graphical interface with which users caninteract. A picture of a page is shown on the top-left side of Fig.7-18. It is the page for the Computer Science & Engineering department at the University of Wash- ington. This page shows text and graphical elements (that are mostly too small to read). Some parts of the page are associated withlinks toother pages. Apieceof text, icon, image, and so on associated with another page is called a hyperlink. To follow a link, the user places the mouse cursor on the linked portion of the page area (which causes the cursor to change shape) and clicks. Following a link is simply a way of telling the browser to fetch another page. In the early days of the Web, links were highlighted with underlining and colored text so that they would stand out. Nowadays, the creators of Web pages have ways to control the look of linked regions, so a link might appear as an icon or change its appearance when the mouse passes over it. It is up to the creators of the page to make the linksvisually distinct, toprovide ausable interface.

SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 649 Students in the department can learn more by following a link to a page with information especially for them. This link is accessed by clicking in the circled area. The browser then fetches the new page and displays it, as partially shown in the bottom left of Fig.7-18. Dozens of other pages are linked off the first page besides this example. Every other page can be comprised of content on the same machine(s) as the first page, or on machines halfway around the globe. The user cannot tell. Page fetching is done bythe browser, withoutany help from the user. Thus,movingbetween machines while viewing content isseamless. The basic model behind the display of pages is also shown in Fig. 7-18. The browser is displaying a Web page on the client machine. Each page is fetched by sending a request to one or more servers, which respond with the contents of the page', 'The request-responseprotocol forfetching pages isasimple text-based pro- tocol that runs over TCP, just as was the case for SMTP. It is called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). The content may simply be a document that is read offadisk,orthe result ofa database query andprogram execution. The page is a static page if it is a document that is the same every time it is displayed. In contrast, if it was generated ondemand bya program or contains a program it is a dynamic page. A dynamic page may present itself differently each time it is displayed. For example, the front page for an electronic store may be different for each visitor. If a bookstore customer has bought mystery novels in the past, upon visiting the store’s main page, the customer is likely to see new thrillers prominently display- ed, whereas a more culinary-minded customer might be greeted with new cook- books. Howthe Web site keeps track ofwholikes what isastorytobetoldshort- ly. But briefly, the answer involves cookies (even for culinarily challenged visi- tors). In the figure, the browser contacts three servers to fetch the two pages, cs.washington.edu, youtube.com, and google-analytics.com. The content from these different servers is integrated for display by the browser. Display entails a range of processing that depends on the kind of content. Besides rendering text and graphics, it may involve playing a video or running a script that presents its own user interface as part of the page. In this case, the cs.washington.edu server supplies the main page, the youtube.com server supplies an embedded video, and the google-analytics.com server supplies nothing that the user can see but tracks visitorstothesite. Wewillhave moretosayabouttrackers later. The Client Side Let us now examine the Web browser side in Fig. 7-18 in more detail. In essence, a browser is a program that can display a Web page and catch mouse clicks to items on the displayed page. When an item is selected, the browser fol- lowsthehyperlinkandfetches thepage selected. 650 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 When the Web was first created, it was immediately apparent that having one page point to another Web page required mechanisms for naming and locating pages. In particular, three questions had to be answered before a selected page couldbedisplayed: 1. What isthepage called? 2. Where isthepagelocated? 3. Howcan thepage beaccessed? If every page were somehow assigned a unique name, there would not be any ambiguity in identifying pages. Nevertheless, the problem would not be solved. Consider aparallel between people andpages. Inthe United States, almost every- one has a social security number, which is a unique identifier, as no two people are supposed to have the same one. Nevertheless, if you are armed only with a social security number, there is no way to find the owner’s address, and certainly no way to tell whether you should write to the person in English, Spanish, or Chinese. The Web hasbasically thesame problems. The solution chosen identifies pages in a way that solves all three problems at once. Each page is assigned a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that ef- fectively serves as the page’s worldwide name', 'URLs have three parts: the proto- col (also known as the scheme), the DNS name of the machine onwhich the page islocated, and the path uniquely indicating the specific page (a file toread or pro- gram to run onthe machine). In the general case, the path has a hierarchical name thatmodels afile directory structure. However, theinterpretation ofthe path isup totheserver; itmayormaynotreflect theactual directory structure. Asanexample, theURLofthepage showninFig.7-18is http://www.cs.washington.edu/index.html This URL consists of three parts: the protocol (http), the DNS name of the host (www.cs.washington.edu),andthepathname (index.html). When a user clicks on a hyperlink, the browser carries out a series of steps in order to fetch the page pointed to. Let us trace the steps that occur when our ex- ample linkisselected: 1. The browser determines theURL(byseeing whatwas selected). 2. The browser asks DNS for the IP address of the server www.cs.washington.edu. 3. DNSreplies with128.208.3.88. 4. The browser makes aTCP connectionto128.208.3.88onport80,the well-knownportfortheHTTP protocol. 5. ItsendsoveranHTTP request askingforthepage/index.html. SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 651 6. The www.cs.washington.edu server sends the page as an HTTP re- sponse,forexample, bysendingthefile /index.html. 7. If the page includes URLs that are needed for display, the browser fetches the other URLs using the same process. In this case, the URLs include multiple embedded images also fetched from www.cs.washington.edu, an embedded video from youtube.com, and ascript fromgoogle-analytics.com. 8. The browser displaysthepage/index.html asitappears inFig. 7-18. 9. The TCP connections are released if there are no other requests to thesame servers forashortperiod. Manybrowsers display which step they are currently executing ina status line at the bottom of the screen. In this way, when the performance is poor, the user can see ifitisduetoDNS notresponding,aserver notresponding,orsimply page transmission overasloworcongestednetwork. The URL design is open-ended in the sense that it is straightforward to have browsers use multiple protocols to get at different kinds of resources. In fact, URLs for various other protocols have been defined. Slightly simplified forms of thecommononesare listed inFig.7-19. Name Usedfor Example http Hypertext(HTML) http://www.ee.uwa.edu/~rob/ https Hypertextwithsecurity https://www.bank.com/accounts/ ftp FTP ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/minix/README file Localfile file:///usr/suzanne/prog.c mailto Sendingemail mailto:JohnUser@acm.org rtsp Streamingmedia rtsp://youtube.com/montypython.mpg sip Multimediacalls sip:eve@adversary.com about Browserinformation about:plugins Figure7-19. SomecommonURLschemes. Let usbriefly gooverthelist. The httpprotocol isthe Web’s native language, the one spoken by Web servers. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Proto- col. We willexamine itinmoredetail later inthissection. The ftp protocol is used toaccess files by FTP, the Internet’s file transfer pro- tocol. FTP predates the Web and has been in use for more than three decades. The Web makes it easy to obtain files placed on numerous FTP servers throughout the world by providing a simple, clickable interface instead of a com- mand-line interface. This improved access to information is one reason for the spectacular growthoftheWeb. 652 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 It is possible to access a local file as a Web page by using the file protocol, or more simply, by just naming it. This approach does not require having a server. Ofcourse, itworksonlyforlocal files, notremote ones. The mailtoprotocol doesnotreally havethe flavor offetching Web pages, but is useful anyway. It allows users tosend email from a Web browser', 'Most brow- sers will respond when a mailto link is followed by starting the user’s mail agent tocompose amessage withtheaddress field already filledin. The rtsp and sip protocols are for establishing streaming media sessions and audioandvideocalls. Finally, the aboutprotocol isaconvention that provides information about the browser. For example, following the about:plugins link will cause most browsers toshowapage thatliststhe MIME types that they handle with browser extensions called plug-ins. In short, the URLs have been designed not only to allow users to navigate the Web, but to run older protocols such as FTP and email as well as newer protocols for audio and video, and to provide convenient access to local files and browser information. This approach makes all the specialized user interface programs for those other services unnecessary and integrates nearly all Internet access into a single program: the Web browser. If it were not for the fact that this idea was thought of by a British physicist working a research lab in Switzerland, it could easily passforaplandreamed upbysome software company’s advertising depart- ment. Despite all these nice properties, the growing use of the Web has turned upan inherent weakness in the URL scheme. A URL points to one specific host, but sometimes it is useful to reference a page without simultaneously telling where it is. For example, for pages that are heavily referenced, it is desirable to have mul- tiple copies far apart, to reduce the network traffic. There is no way to say: ‘‘I wantpage xyz,butIdonotcare where yougetit.’’ To solve this kind of problem, URLs have been generalized into URIs (Uni- form Resource Identifiers). Some URIs tell how to locate a resource. These are the URLs. Other URIs tell the name of a resource but not where to find it. These URIs are called URNs (Uniform Resource Names). The rules for writing URIs are given in RFC 3986, while the different URI schemes in use are tracked by IANA. There are many different kinds of URIs besides the schemes listed in Fig.7-19,butthoseschemes dominate theWeb asitisusedtoday. MIME Types To be able to display the new page (or any page), the browser has to under- stand its format. To allow all browsers to understand all Web pages, Web pages are written in a standardized language called HTML. It is the lingua franca of the Web (fornow). We willdiscuss itindetail later inthischapter. SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 653 Although a browser is basically an HTML interpreter, most browsers have numerous buttonsand features tomake iteasier tonavigate theWeb. Mosthave a button for going back to the previous page, a button for going forward to the next page (only operative after the user has gone back from it), and a button for going straight to the user’s preferred start page. Most browsers have a button or menu item to set a bookmark on a given page and another one to display the list of bookmarks, making it possible to revisit any of them with only a few mouse clicks. As our example shows, HTML pages can contain rich content elements and not simply text and hypertext', 'For added generality, not all pages need contain HTML. A page may consist of a video in MPEG format, a document in PDF for- mat, a photograph in JPEG format, a song in MP3 format, or any one of hundreds of other file types. Since standard HTML pages may link to any of these, the browser hasaproblem whenithitsapage itdoesnotknowhowtointerpret. Rather than making the browsers larger and larger by building in interpreters for a rapidly growing collection of file types, most browsers have chosen a more general solution. When a server returns a page, it also returns some additional information aboutthe page. This information includes the MIME typeofthepage (see Fig.7-13). Pages of type text/html are just displayed directly, as are pages in a few other built-in types. If the MIME type is not one of the built-in ones, the browser consults its table of MIME types to determine how to display the page. Thistable associates MIMEtypeswithviewers. There are two possibilities: plug-ins and helper applications. A plug-in is a third-party code module that is installed as an extension to the browser, as illus- trated inFig. 7-20(a). Common examples are plug-ins forPDF, Flash, andQuick- time to render documents and play audio and video. Because plug-ins run inside thebrowser, theyhaveaccesstothecurrent page andcan modifyitsappearance. Helper Browser Plug-in Browser application Process Process Process (a) (b) Figure7-20. (a)Abrowserplug-in.(b)Ahelperapplication. Each browser has a set of procedures that all plug-ins must implement so the browser can call the plug-ins. For example, there is typically a procedure the 654 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 browser’s base code calls to supply the plug-in with data to display. This set of procedures istheplug-in’sinterfaceandisbrowser specific. In addition, the browser makes a set of its own procedures available to the plug-in, to provide services to plug-ins. Typical procedures in the browser inter- faceare forallocating andfreeing memory, displaying amessage onthe browser’s status line,andquerying thebrowser aboutparameters. Before a plug-in can be used, it must be installed. The usual installation pro- cedure is for the user to go to the plug-in’s Web site and download an installation file. Executing the installation file unpacks the plug-in and makes the appropriate calls to register the plug-in’s MIME type with the browser and associate the plug-inwithit. Browsers usually come preloaded withpopularplug-ins. The other way toextend a browser is make use of a helper application. This is a complete program, running as a separate process. It is illustrated in Fig.7- 20(b). Since thehelper isaseparate program, theinterfaceisat arm’s length from the browser. It usually just accepts the name of a scratch file where the content file has been stored, opens the file, and displays the contents. Typically, helpers are large programs that exist independently of the browser, for example, Micro- softWordorPowerPoint. Many helper applications use the MIME type application. As a consequence, a considerable number of subtypes have been defined for them to use, for exam- ple, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint for PowerPoint files. vnd denotes vendor-spe- cific formats', 'In this way, a URL can point directly to a PowerPoint file, and when the user clicks on it, PowerPoint is automatically started and handed the content to be displayed. Helper applications are not restricted to using the appli- cationMIMEtype.. AdobePhotoshopusesimage/x-photoshop,forexample. Consequently, browsers can be configured to handle a virtually unlimited number of document types with no changes to themselves. Modern Web servers are often configured with hundreds of type/subtype combinations and new ones are often addedevery time anewprogramisinstalled. A source of conflicts is that multiple plug-ins and helper applications are available for some subtypes, such as video/mpeg. What happens is that the last one to register overwrites the existing association with the MIME type, capturing the type for itself. As a consequence, installing a new program may change the wayabrowser handles existing types. Browsers can also openlocal files, with nonetwork insight, rather than fetch- ingthem fromremote Web servers. However, the browser needs some way tode- termine the MIME type of the file. The standard method is for the operating sys- tem to associate a file extension with a MIME type. In a typical configuration, opening foo.pdf will open it in the browser using an application/pdf plug-in and openingbar.doc willopenitinWordasthe application/mswordhelper. Here, too, conflicts can arise, since many programs are willing—no, make that eager—to handle, say, mpg. During installation, programs intended for sophisticated users often display checkboxes for the MIME types and extensions SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 655 they are prepared to handle to allow the user to select the appropriate ones and thus not overwrite existing associations by accident. Programs aimed at the con- sumer market assume that the user does not have a clue what a MIME type is and simply grab everything they can without regard to what previously installed pro- gramshave done. The ability to extend the browser with a large number of new types is con- venient but can also lead to trouble. When a browser on a Windows PC fetches a file with the extension exe, it realizes that this file is an executable program and therefore has no helper. The obvious action is to run the program. However, this could be an enormous security hole. All a malicious Web site has to do is pro- duce a Web page with pictures of, say, movie stars or sports heroes, all of which are linked to a virus. A single click on a picture then causes an unknown and po- tentially hostile executable program to be fetched and run on the user’s machine. Toprevent unwanted guests like this, Firefox and other browsers come configured to be cautious about running unknown programs automatically, but not all users understandwhat choices are safe rather thanconvenient. The Server Side So much for the client side. Now let us take a look at the server side. As we saw above, when the user types in a URL or clicks on a line of hypertext, the browser parses the URL and interprets the part between http:// and the next slash as a DNS name to look up', 'Armed with the IP address of the server, the browser establishes a TCP connection toport 80 on that server. Then it sends over a com- mand containing the rest of the URL, which is the path to the page on that server. The server thenreturns thepage forthebrowser todisplay. To a first approximation, a simple Web server is similar to the server of Fig.6-6. That server is given the name of a file to look up and return via the net- work. Inbothcases, thestepsthattheserver performs initsmainloopare: 1. AcceptaTCP connectionfromaclient (abrowser). 2. Getthepathtothepage, whichisthename ofthefile requested. 3. Getthefile (fromdisk). 4. Sendthecontents ofthefile totheclient. 5. Release theTCP connection. ModernWeb servers have more features, butinessence, thisiswhat a Web server does for the simple case of content that is contained in a file. For dynamic con- tent, the third step may be replaced by the execution of a program (determined fromthepath) thatreturns thecontents. However, Web servers are implemented with a different design to serve many requests per second. One problem with the simple design is that accessing files is 656 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 often the bottleneck. Disk reads are very slow compared to program execution, and the same files may be read repeatedly from disk using operating system calls. Another problem is that only one request is processed at a time. The file may be large, andother requests willbeblocked while itistransferred. One obvious improvement (used by all Web servers) is to maintain a cache in memory of the n most recently read files or a certain number of gigabytes of con- tent. Before going to disk to get a file, the server checks the cache. If the file is there, it can be served directly from memory, thus eliminating the disk access. Although effective caching requires a large amount of main memory and some extra processing time to check the cache and manage its contents, the savings in time are nearly always worththeoverhead andexpense. To tackle the problem of serving a single request at a time, one strategy is to make the server multithreaded. In one design, the server consists of a front-end module that accepts all incoming requests and k processing modules, as shown in Fig.7-21. The k +1 threads all belong to the same process, so the processing modules all have access to the cache within the process’ address space. When a request comes in, the front end accepts it and builds a short record describing it. Itthenhandstherecord tooneoftheprocessing modules. Processing module (thread) Disk Request Frontend Cache Response Client Server Figure7-21. AmultithreadedWebserverwithafrontendandprocessingmodules. The processing module first checks the cache to see if the file needed is there. If so, it updates the record to include a pointer to the file in the record. If it is not there, the processing module starts a disk operation to read it into the cache (pos- sibly discarding some other cached file(s) to make room for it). When the file comes infromthedisk,itisputinthecacheandalsosentback totheclient', 'The advantage of this scheme is that while one or more processing modules are blocked waiting for a disk or network operation to complete (and thus con- suming no CPU time), other modules can be actively working on other requests. With k processing modules, the throughput can be as much as k times higher than with a single-threaded server. Of course, when the disk or network is the limiting SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 657 factor, itisnecessarytohave multipledisks ora faster network toget any real im- provement overthesingle-threaded model. Modern Web servers do more than just accept path names and return files. In fact, the actual processing ofeachrequest can get quite complicated. Forthis rea- son,inmanyservers eachprocessing moduleperforms aseries ofsteps. The front end passes each incoming request tothe first available module, which then carries it out using some subset of the following steps, depending on which ones are needed for that particular request. These steps occur after the TCP connection and any secure transport mechanism (such as SSL/TLS, which will be described inChap. 8)have been established. 1. Resolve thename oftheWeb pagerequested. 2. Perform accesscontrol ontheWeb page. 3. Check thecache. 4. Fetch therequested page fromdiskorrunaprogram tobuildit. 5. Determine therest oftheresponse(e.g., theMIMEtypetosend). 6. Return theresponsetotheclient. 7. Make anentry intheserver log. Step 1isneeded becausethe incoming request may notcontain the actual name of a file or program as a literal string. It may contain built-in shortcuts that need to be translated. As a simple example, the URL http://www.cs.vu.nl/ has an empty file name. It has to be expanded to some default file name that is usually index.html. Another common rule is to map ~user/ onto user’s Web directory. These rules can be used together. Thus, the home page of one of the authors (AST) can bereachedat http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/ even thoughtheactual file name isindex.html inacertain default directory. Also, modern browsers can specify configuration information such as the browser software and the user’s default language (e.g., Italian or English). This makes it possible for the server to select a Web page with small pictures for a mobile device andinthepreferred language,ifavailable. Ingeneral, name expan- sion is not quite so trivial as it might at first appear, due to a variety of conven- tionsabouthowtomappathstothefile directory andprograms. Step 2 checks to see if any access restrictions associated with the page are met. Not all pages are available to the general public. Determining whether a cli- ent can fetch a page may depend on the identity of the client (e.g., as given by usernames and passwords) or the location of the client in the DNS or IP space. For example, a page may be restricted to users inside a company. How this is 658 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 accomplished depends on the design of the server. For the popular Apache server, for instance, the convention is to place a file called .htaccess that lists the access restrictions inthedirectory where therestricted pageislocated. Steps 3 and 4 involve getting the page. Whether it can be taken from the cache depends on processing rules', 'For example, pages that are created by run- ning programs cannot always be cached because they might produce a different result each time they are run. Even files should occasionally be checked to see if their contents have changed so that the old contents can be removed from the cache. If the page requires a program to be run, there is also the issue of setting the program parameters or input. These data come from the path or other parts of therequest. Step 5 is about determining other parts of the response that accompany the contents of the page. The MIME type is one example. It may come from the file extension, the first few words of the file or program output, a configuration file, andpossiblyother sources. Step 6 is returning the page across the network. To increase performance, a single TCP connection may be used by a client and server for multiple page fetches. This reuse means that some logic is needed to map a request to a shared connection and to return each response so that it is associated with the correct re- quest. Step 7 makes an entry in the system log for administrative purposes, along with keeping anyother important statistics. Suchlogscan later beminedforvalu- able information about user behavior, for example, the order in which people ac- cess thepages. Cookies Navigating the Web as we have described it so far involves a series of inde- pendent page fetches. There is no concept of a login session. The browser sends a request to a server and gets back a file. Then the server forgets that it has ever seen thatparticular client. This model is perfectly adequate for retrieving publicly available documents, and it worked well when the Web was first created. However, it is not suited for returning different pages to different users depending on what they have already done with the server. This behavior is needed for many ongoing interactions with Web sites. For example, some Web sites (e.g., newspapers) require clients to reg- ister (and possibly pay money) to use them. This raises the question of how ser- vers can distinguish between requests from users who have previously registered and everyone else. A second example is from e-commerce. If a user wanders around an electronic store, tossing items into her virtual shopping cart from time to time, how does the server keep track of the contents of the cart? A third ex- ample iscustomized Webportals suchasYahoo!. Users can set upapersonalized SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 659 detailed initial page with only the information they want (e.g., their stocks and their favorite sports teams), but how can the server display the correct page if it doesnotknowwhotheuseris? At first glance, one might think that servers could track users by observing their IP addresses. However, this idea does not work. Many users share com- puters, especially at home, and the IP address merely identifies the computer, not the user. Even worse, many companies use NAT, so that outgoing packets bear the same IP address for all users', 'That is, all of the computers behind the NAT box look the same to the server. And many ISPs assign IP addresses to customers with DHCP. The IP addresses change over time, so to a server you might sudden- ly look like your neighbor. For all of these reasons, the server cannot use IP ad- dresses totrack users. This problem is solved with an oft-critized mechanism called cookies. The name derives from ancient programmer slang in which a program calls a proce- dure and gets something back that it may need to present later to get some work done. In this sense, a UNIX file descriptor or a Windows object handle can be considered tobe a cookie. Cookies were first implemented in the Netscape brow- serin1994andare nowspecified inRFC 2109. When a client requests a Web page, the server can supply additional infor- mation in the form of a cookie along with the requested page. The cookie is a rather small, named string (of at most 4 KB) that the server can associate with a browser. This association is not the same thing as a user, butit is much closer and more useful than an IP address. Browsers store the offered cookies for an inter- val, usually in a cookie directory on the client’s disk so that the cookies persist a- cross browser invocations, unless the user has disabled cookies. Cookies are just strings, not executable programs. In principle, a cookie could contain a virus, but since cookies are treated as data, there is no official way for the virus to actually run and do damage. However, it is always possible for some hacker to exploit a browser bugtocause activation. A cookie may contain up to five fields, as shown in Fig.7-22. The Domain tells where the cookie came from. Browsers are supposed to check that servers are not lying about their domain. Each domain should store no more than 20 cookies per client. The Path is a path in the server’s directory structure that iden- tifies which parts of the server’s file tree may use the cookie. It is often /, which means thewholetree. The Content field takes the form name = value. Both name and value can be anythingtheserver wants. Thisfield iswhere thecookie’scontent isstored. The Expires field specifies when the cookieexpires. Ifthisfield isabsent, the browser discards the cookie when it exits. Such a cookie is called a nonper- sistent cookie. If a time and date are supplied, the cookie is said to be a per- sistent cookie and is kept until it expires. Expiration times are given in Greenwich Mean Time. To remove a cookie from a client’s hard disk, a server justsendsitagain, butwithanexpiration time inthepast. 660 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Domain Path Content Expires Secure toms-casino.com / CustomerID=297793521 15-10-1017:00 Yes jills-store.com / Cart=1-00501;1-07031;2-13721 11-1-1114:22 No aportal.com / Prefs=Stk:CSCO+ORCL;Spt:Jets 31-12-2023:59 No sneaky.com / UserID=4627239101 31-12-1923:59 No Figure7-22. Someexamplesofcookies. Finally, the Secure field can be set to indicate that the browser may only re- turn the cookie to a server using a secure transport, namely SSL/TLS (which we willdescribe inChap. 8)', 'Thisfeature isusedfore-commerce, banking, andother secure applications. We have nowseen howcookiesare acquired, buthoware they used? Just be- fore abrowser sendsarequest forapage tosomeWeb site, itchecks itscookiedi- rectory to see if any cookies there were placed by the domain the request is going to. If so, all the cookies placed by that domain, and only that domain, are in- cluded in the request message. When the server gets them, it can interpret them anywayitwants to. Let us examine some possible uses for cookies. In Fig. 7-22, the first cookie was set by toms-casino.com and is used to identify the customer. When the client returns next week to throw away some more money, the browser sends over the cookie sothe server knows who it is. Armed with the customer ID, the server can look up the customer’s record in a database and use this information to build an appropriate Web page to display. Depending on the customer’s known gambling habits, this page might consist of a poker hand, a listing of today’s horse races, or aslotmachine. The second cookie came from jills-store.com. The scenario here is that the client is wandering around the store, looking for good things to buy. When she findsabargain andclicks onit, the server adds it toher shopping cart (maintained onthe server) and alsobuildsacookiecontaining theproductcode oftheitemand sends the cookie back to the client. As the client continues to wander around the store by clicking on new pages, the cookie is returned to the server on every new page request. As more purchases accumulate, the server adds them to the cookie. Finally, when the client clicks on PROCEED TO CHECKOUT, the cookie, now con- taining the full list of purchases, is sent along with the request. In this way, the server knowsexactly whatthecustomer wants tobuy. The third cookie is for a Web portal. When the customer clicks on a link to the portal, the browser sends over the cookie. This tells the portal to build a page containing the stock prices for Cisco and Oracle, and the New York Jets’ football results. Since a cookie can be upto4KB, there isplenty ofroomformore detail- edpreferences concerning newspaper headlines, local weather, special offers, etc. SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 661 A more controversial use of cookies is to track the online behavior of users. This lets Web site operators understand how users navigate their sites, and advertisers build up profiles of the ads or sites a particular user has viewed. The controversy is that users are typically unaware that their activity is being tracked, even with detailed profiles and across seemingly unrelated Web sites. Nonethe- less, Web tracking is big business. DoubleClick, which provides and tracks ads, is ranked among the 100 busiest Web sites in the world by the Web monitoring company Alexa. Google Analytics, which tracks site usage for operators, is used bymorethanhalfofthebusiest100,000sites ontheWeb. It is easy for a server to track user activity with cookies. Suppose a server wants to keep track of how many unique visitors it has had and how many pages each visitor looked at before leaving the site', 'When the first request comes in, there will be no accompanying cookie, so the server sends back a cookie con- taining Counter = 1. Subsequent page views on that site will send the cookie back to the server. Each time the counter is incremented and sent back to the cli- ent. By keeping track of the counters, the server can see how many people give upafter seeing thefirstpage, howmanylookattwopages, andsoon. Tracking the browsing behavior of users across sites is only slightly more complicated. It works like this. An advertising agency, say, Sneaky Ads, con- tacts major Web sites and places ads for its clients’ products on their pages, for which it pays the site owners afee. Instead, ofgivingthesites theadasaGIFfile to place on each page, it gives them a URL to add to each page. Each URL it handsoutcontains auniquenumber inthepath, suchas http://www.sneaky.com/382674902342.gif When a user first visits a page, P, containing such an ad, the browser fetches the HTML file. Then the browser inspects the HTML file and sees the link to the image file at www.sneaky.com, so it sends a request there for the image. A GIF file containing an ad is returned, along with a cookie containing a unique user ID, 4627239101 in Fig. 7-22. Sneaky records the fact that the user with this ID visited page P. This is easy to do since the path requested (382674902342.gif) is referenced only on page P. Of course, the actual ad may appear on thousands of pages, buteachtime witha different name. Sneaky probablycollects afraction of apennyfromtheproductmanufacturer eachtimeitshipsoutthead. Later, when the user visits another Web page containing any of Sneaky’s ads, the browser first fetches the HTML file from the server. Then it sees the link to, say, http://www.sneaky.com/193654919923.gif on the page and requests that file. Since it already has a cookie from the domain sneaky.com, the browser includes Sneaky’s cookie containing the user’s ID. Sneaky now knows a second page the userhasvisited. In due course, Sneaky can build up a detailed profile of the user’s browsing habits, even though the user has never clicked on any of the ads. Of course, it does not yet have the user’s name (although it does have his IP address, which 662 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 may be enough to deduce the name from other databases). However, if the user ever supplies his name to any site cooperating with Sneaky, a complete profile along with a name will be available for sale to anyone who wants to buy it. The sale ofthis information may beprofitable enoughforSneaky toplacemore ads on more Websites andthuscollect moreinformation. And if Sneaky wants to be supersneaky, the ad need not be a classical banner ad. An ‘‘ad’’ consisting of a single pixel in the background color (and thus invisi- ble) has exactly the same effect as a banner ad: it requires the browser to go fetch the 1×1-pixel GIF image and send it all cookies originating at the pixel’s do- main. Cookieshave become a focal point for the debate over online privacy because oftracking behavior like the above', 'The mostinsidiouspartofthewholebusiness is that many users are completely unaware of this information collection and may even think they are safe because they do not click on any of the ads. For this rea- son, cookies that track users across sites are considered by many to be spyware. Have a look at the cookies that are already stored by your browser. Most brow- sers will display this information along with the current privacy preferences. You might be surprised tofindnames, email addresses, orpasswords aswell asopaque identifiers. Hopefully, you will not find credit card numbers, but the potential for abuse isclear. To maintain a semblance of privacy, some users configure their browsers to reject all cookies. However, this can cause problems because many Web sites will not work properly without cookies. Alternatively, most browsers let users block third-party cookies. A third-party cookie is one from a different site than the main page that is being fetched, for example, the sneaky.com cookie that is used when interacting with page P on a completely different Web site. Blocking these cookies helps to prevent tracking across Web sites. Browser extensions can also be installed to provide fine-grained control over how cookies are used (or, rather, not used). As the debate continues, many companies are developing priva- cypolicies that limit howtheywillshare information toprevent abuse. Ofcourse, the policies are simply how the companies say they will handle information. For example: ‘‘We may use the information collected from you in the conduct of our business’’—which mightbesellingtheinformation. 7.3.2 Static Web Pages The basis of the Web is transferring Web pages from server to client. In the simplest form, Web pages are static. That is, they are just files sitting on some server that present themselves in the same way each time they are fetched and viewed. Just because they are static does not mean that the pages are inert at the browser, however. Apage containing avideocan beastatic Webpage. As mentioned earlier, the lingua franca of the Web, in which most pages are written, is HTML. The home pages of teachers are usually static HTML pages. SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 663 The home pages of companies are usually dynamic pages put together by a Web design company. In this section, we will take a brief look at static HTML pages as a foundation for later material. Readers already familiar with HTML can skip ahead tothenextsection, where wedescribe dynamiccontent andWebservices. HTML—The HyperText MarkupLanguage HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was introduced with the Web. It allows users to produce Web pages that include text, graphics, video, pointers to other Web pages, and more. HTML is a markup language, or language for describing how documents are to be formatted. The term ‘‘markup’’ comes from the old days when copyeditors actually marked up documents to tell the printer— in those days, a human being—which fonts to use, and so on. Markup languages thus contain explicit commands for formatting. For example, in HTML, <b> means start boldface mode, and </b> means leave boldface mode. LaTeX and TeX are other examples of markup languages that are well known to most academicauthors', 'The key advantage of a markup language over one with no explicit markup is that it separates content from how it should be presented. Writing a browser is then straightforward: the browser simply has tounderstand the markup commands and apply them to the content. Embedding all the markup commands within each HTML file andstandardizing them makes it possible for any Web browser to read and reformat any Web page. That is crucial because a page may have been pro- duced ina1600×1200windowwith24-bitcoloronahigh-endcomputer butmay have tobedisplayed ina640×320windowonamobile phone. While it is certainly possible to write documents like this with any plain text editor, and many people do, it is also possible to use word processors or special HTML editors that do most of the work (but correspondingly give the user less direct control overthedetails ofthefinal result). A simple Web page written in HTML and its presentation in a browser are given in Fig. 7-23. A Web page consists of a head and a body, each enclosed by <html> and </html> tags (formatting commands), although most browsers do not complain if these tags are missing. As can be seen in Fig.7-23(a), the head is bracketed by the <head> and </head> tags and the body is bracketed by the <body> and </body> tags. The strings inside the tags are called directives. Most, but not all, HTML tags have this format. That is, they use <something> to mark thebeginningofsomething and</something> tomark itsend. Tags can be in either lowercase or uppercase. Thus, <head> and <HEAD> mean thesame thing,butlower case isbestforcompatibility. Actual layoutofthe HTML document is irrelevant. HTML parsers ignore extra spaces and carriage returns since they have to reformat the text to make it fit the current display area. Consequently, white space can be added at will to make HTML documents more 664 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 readable, something most of them are badly in need of. As another consequence, blank lines cannot be used to separate paragraphs, as they are simply ignored. An explicit tagisrequired. Some tags have (named) parameters, called attributes. For example, the <img> tag in Fig. 7-23 is used for including an image inline with the text. It has two attributes, src and alt. The first attribute gives the URL for the image. The HTML standard does not specify which image formats are permitted. In practice, all browsers support GIF and JPEG files. Browsers are free to support other for- mats, but this extension is a two-edged sword. If a user is accustomed to a brow- ser that supports,say, TIFF files, he may include these in his Web pages and later besurprised whenother browsers justignoreallofhiswonderfulart. The second attribute gives alternate text to use if the image cannot be dis- played. For each tag, the HTML standard gives a list of what the permitted pa- rameters, if any, are, and what they mean. Because each parameter is named, the orderinwhichtheparameters are givenisnotsignificant. Technically, HTML documents are written in the ISO 8859-1 Latin-1 charac- ter set, but for users whose keyboards support only ASCII, escape sequences are present forthe special characters, such as e`', 'The list ofspecial characters is given in the standard. All of them begin with an ampersand and end with a semicolon. For example, &nbsp; produces a space, &egrave; produces e` and &eacute; pro- duces e´. Since <, >, and & have special meanings, they can be expressed only withtheir escape sequences, &lt;,&gt;,and&amp;, respectively. The mainiteminthehead isthe title, delimited by<title> and</title>. Certain kinds of metainformation may also be present, though none are present in our ex- ample. The title itself is not displayed onthe page. Some browsers use it to label thepage’s window. Several headings are used inFig.7-23. Each heading isgenerated byan <hn> tag, where n is a digit in the range 1 to 6. Thus, <h1> is the most important head- ing; <h6> is the least important one. It is up to the browser to render these ap- propriately on the screen. Typically, the lower-numbered headings will be dis- played in a larger and heavier font. The browser may also choose to use different colors for each level of heading. Usually, <h1> headings are large and boldface with at least one blank line above and below. In contrast, <h2> headings are in a smaller fontwithlessspaceaboveandbelow. The tags<b>and<i>are usedtoenter boldfaceanditalics mode, respectively. The <hr>tagforces abreak anddraws ahorizontal lineacross thedisplay. The <p> tag starts a paragraph. The browser might display this by inserting a blank line and some indentation, for example. Interestingly, the </p> tag that exists to mark the end of a paragraph is often omitted by lazy HTML pro- grammers. HTML provides various mechanisms for making lists, including nested lists. Unordered lists, like the ones in Fig.7-23 are started with <ul>, with <li> used to mark the start of items. There is also an <ol> tag to starts an ordered list.

Items inordered listsare numbered bythebrowser. Finally, we come to hyperlinks. Examples of these are seen in Fig.7-23 using the <a> (anchor) and </a> tags. The <a> tag has various parameters, the most im- portant ofwhich ishrefthelinkedURL. The text between the <a> and</a> isdis- played. Ifit isselected, the hyperlinkisfollowed toa newpage. Itisalsopermit- ted to link other elements. For example, an image can be given between the <a> and </a> tags using <img>. In this case, the image is displayed and clicking on it activates thehyperlink. There are many other HTML tags and attributes that we have not seen in this simple example. For instance, the <a> tag can take a parameter name to plant a hyperlink, allowing a hyperlink to point to the middle of a page. This is useful, for example, for Web pages that start out with a clickable table of contents', 'By clicking on an item in the table of contents, the user jumps to the corresponding section of the same page. An example of a different tag is <br>. It forces the browser tobreak andstart anewline. Probably the best way to understand tags is to look at them in action. To do this, you can pick a Web page and look at the HTML in your browser to see how the page was put together. Most browsers have a VIEW SOURCE menu item (or something similar). Selecting this item displays the current page’s HTML source, instead ofitsformatted output. We have sketched the tags that have existed from the early Web. HTML keeps evolving. Fig.7-24 shows some of the features that have been added with successive versions of HTML. HTML 1.0 refers to the version of HTML used with the introduction of the Web. HTML versions 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 appeared in rapid succession in the space of only a few years as the Web exploded. After HTML 4.0, a period of almost ten years passed before the path to standarization ofthenextmajor version, HTML 5.0,becameclear. Becauseit is amajor upgrade that consolidates the ways that browsers handle rich content, the HTML 5.0 effort is ongoing and not expected to produce a standard before 2012 at the earliest. Standards notwithstanding, the major browsers already support HTML 5.0 func- tionality. The progression through HTML versions is all about adding new features that people wanted but had to handle in nonstandard ways (e.g., plug-ins) until they became standard. For example, HTML 1.0 and HTML 2.0 did not have tables. They were added in HTML 3.0. An HTML table consists of one or more rows, each consisting of one or more table cells that can contain a wide range of mater- ial (e.g., text, images, other tables). Before HTML 3.0, authors needing a table hadtoresort toadhocmethods,suchasincludinganimage showingthetable. In HTML 4.0, more new features were added. These included accessibility features for handicapped users, object embedding (a generalization of the <img> tag so other objects can also be embedded in pages), support for scripting lan- guages (toallow dynamiccontent), andmore.

Somedifferences betweenHTMLversions. HTML 5.0 includes many features to handle the rich media that are now rou- tinely used on the Web. Video and audio can be included in pages and played by the browser without requiring the user to install plug-ins. Drawings can be built up in the browser as vector graphics, rather than using bitmap image formats (like JPEG andGIF) There isalsomore supportforrunningscripts inbrowsers, such as background threads of computation and access to storage', 'All of these features help to support Web pages that are more like traditional applications with a user interfacethan documents. Thisisthedirection theWeb isheading. Inputand Forms There is one important capability that we have not discussed yet: input. HTML 1.0was basically one-way. Users could fetch pages frominformation pro- viders, but it was difficult to send information back the other way. It quickly became apparent that there was a need for two-way traffic to allow orders for products to be placed via Web pages, registration cards to be filled out online, search terms tobeentered, andmuch,muchmore. 668 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Sending input from the user to the server (via the browser) requires two kinds of support. First, it requires that HTTP be able to carry data in that direction. We describe how this is done in a later section; it uses the POST method. The second requirement is to be able to present user interface elements that gather and pack- age uptheinput. Forms were included withthisfunctionalityinHTML 2.0. Forms contain boxes or buttons that allow users to fill in information or make choices and then send the information back to the page’s owner. Forms are writ- ten just like other parts of HTML, as seen in the example of Fig. 7-25. Note that forms are still static content. They exhibit the same behavior regardless of who is using them. Dynamic content, which we will cover later, provides more sophisti- cated ways to gather input by sending a program whose behavior may depend on thebrowser environment. Like allforms, thisoneisenclosed between the<form> and</form> tags. The attributes of this tag tell what to do with the data that are input, in this case using the POST method to send the data to the specified URL. Text not enclosed in a tag is just displayed. All the usual tags (e.g., <b>) are allowed in a form tolet the author ofthepage control thelookoftheformonthescreen. Three kinds of input boxes are used in this form, each of which uses the <input> tag. It has a variety of parameters for determining the size, nature, and usage of the box displayed. The most common forms are blank fields for ac- cepting user text, boxes that can be checked, and submit buttons that cause the data tobereturned totheserver. The first kind of input box is a text box that follows the text ‘‘Name’’. The box is 46 characters wide and expects the user to type in a string, which is then storedinthevariable customer. The next line of the form asks for the user’s street address, 40 characters wide. Then comes alineaskingforthecity, state, andcountry. Since no<p>tags are used between these fields, the browser displays them all on one line (instead of as separate paragraphs) if they will fit. As far as the browser is concerned, the one paragraph contains just six items: three strings alternating with three boxes. The next line asks for the credit card number and expiration date. Transmitting credit card numbers over the Internet should only be done when adequate security measures have been taken. We willdiscuss someofthese inChap. 8', 'Following the expiration date, we encounter a new feature: radio buttons. These are usedwhenachoice mustbemade amongtwoormore alternatives. The intellectual model here is a car radio with half a dozen buttons for choosing sta- tions. Clicking on one button turns off all the other ones in the same group. The visual presentation is up to the browser. Widget size also uses two radio buttons. The two groups are distinguished by their name parameter, not by static scoping usingsomething like<radiobutton>... </radiobutton>. The value parameters are used to indicate which radio button was pushed.

The value string is the label on the button and is displayed. When the user clicks the submit button, the browser packages the collected information into a single long line and sends it back to the server to the URL provided as part of the <form> tag. A simple encoding is used. The &isused toseparate fields and+ isused torepresent space.

(It is broken into three lines here because the page is not wide enough.) It is up to the server to make sense of this string, most likely by passing the information to a program that will process it. We willdiscuss howthiscan bedoneinthenextsection. There are also other types of input that are not shown in this simple example. Two other types are password and textarea. A password boxis the same as a text box (the default type that need not be named), except that the characters are not displayed as they are typed. A textarea box is also the same as a text box, except thatitcan contain multiplelines. For long lists from which a choice must be made, the <select> and </select> tags are provided to bracket a list of alternatives. This list is often rendered as a drop-downmenu. The semantics are thoseofradio buttonsunless the multiplepa- rameter isgiven,inwhich case thesemantics are thoseofcheckboxes. Finally, there are ways to indicate default or initial values that the user can change. For example, if a text box is given a value field, the contents are dis- played intheformfortheusertoeditorerase. CSS—Cascading Style Sheets The original goal of HTML was to specify the structure of the document, not itsappearance', 'Forexample, <h1> Deborah’sPhotos</h1> instructs the browser to emphasize the heading, but does not say anything about the typeface, point size, or color. That is left up to the browser, which knows the properties of the display (e.g., how many pixels it has). However, many Web page designers wanted absolute control over how their pages appeared, so new tagswere added toHTML tocontrol appearance, suchas <fontface=\"helvetica\" size=\"24\" color=\"red\"> Deborah’sPhotos</font> SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 671 Also, ways were added to control positioning on the screen accurately. The trou- ble with this approach is that it is tedious and produces bloated HTML that is not portable. Althougha page may render perfectly inthe browser it is developed on, it may be a complete mess in another browser or another release of the same browser oratadifferent screen resolution. A better alternative is the use of style sheets. Style sheets in text editors allow authors to associate text with a logical style instead of a physical style, for ex- ample, ‘‘initial paragraph’’ instead of ‘‘italic text.’’ The appearance of each style is defined separately. In this way, if the author decides to change the initial para- graphsfrom14-pointitalics inblueto18-pointboldfaceinshockingpink,all it re- quiresischanging onedefinitiontoconvertthe entire document. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) introduced style sheets to the Web with HTML 4.0, though widespread use and browser support did not take off until 2000. CSS defines a simple language for describing rules that control the appear- ance of tagged content. Let us look at an example. Suppose that AWI wants snazzy Web pages with navy text in the Arial font on an off-white background, and level headings that are an extra 100% and 50% larger than the text for each level, respectively. The CSSdefinitioninFig. 7-27givesthese rules. body{background-color:linen;color:navy;font-family:Arial;} h1{font-size:200%;} h2{font-size:150%;} Figure7-27. CSSexample. As can be seen, the style definitions can be compact. Each line selects an ele- ment to which it applies and gives the values of properties. The properties of an element apply as defaults to all other HTML elements that it contains. Thus, the style forbodysets the style forparagraphs oftextinthebody. There are alsocon- venient shorthands for color names (e.g., red). Any style parameters that are not defined are filled with defaults by the browser. This behavior makes style sheet definitionsoptional; some reasonable presentation willoccur withoutthem. Style sheets can be placed in an HTML file (e.g., using the <style> tag), but it ismore common toplacethem ina separate file and reference them. Forexample, the <head> tag of the AWI page can be modified to refer to a style sheet in the file awistyle.css as shown in Fig.7-28. The example also shows the MIME type ofCSS files tobetext/css. <head> <title>AMALGAMATEDWIDGET,INC.</title> <linkrel=\"stylesheet\"type=\"text/css\"href=\"awistyle.css\"/> </head> Figure7-28. IncludingaCSSstylesheet. 672 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 This strategy has two advantages. First, it lets one set of styles be applied to many pages on a Web site. This organization lends a consistent appearance to pages even if they were developed by different authors at different times, and al- lows the look of the entire site to be changed by editing one CSS file and not the HTML', 'This method can be compared to an #include file in a C program: chang- ing one macro definition there changes it in all the program files that include the header. The second advantage is that the HTML files that are downloaded are kept small. Thisisbecausethe browser can downloadonecopyoftheCSS file for all pages that reference it. It does not need to download a new copy of the defini- tionsalongwitheachWeb page. 7.3.3 Dynamic Web Pages and Web Applications The static page model we have used so far treats pages as multimedia docu- ments that are conveniently linked together. It was a fitting model in the early days of the Web, as vast amounts of information were put online. Nowadays, much of the excitement around the Web is using it for applications and services. Examples include buying products on e-commerce sites, searching library cata- logs,exploring maps, reading andsendingemail, andcollaborating ondocuments. These new uses are like traditional application software (e.g., mail readers and word processors). The twist is that these applications run inside the browser, with user data stored on servers in Internet data centers. They use Web protocols to access information via the Internet, and the browser to display a user interface. The advantage of this approach is that users do not need to install separate appli- cation programs, and user data can be accessed from different computers and backed up by the service operator. It is proving so successful that it is rivaling traditional application software. Of course, the fact that these applications are of- fered for free by large providers helps. This model is the prevalent form of cloud computing, in which computing moves off individual desktop computers and into shared clusters ofservers intheInternet. To act as applications, Web pages can nolonger be static. Dynamic content is needed. For example, a page of the library catalog should reflect which books are currently available and which books are checked out and are thus not available. Similarly, a useful stock market page would allow the user to interact with the page to see stock prices over different periods of time and compute profits and losses. As these examples suggest, dynamic content can be generated by pro- gramsrunningontheserver orinthebrowser (orinbothplaces). In this section, we will examine each of these two cases in turn. The general situation is as shown in Fig.7-29. For example, consider a map service that lets the user enter a street address and presents a corresponding map of the location. Given a request for a location, the Web server must use a program to create a page that shows the map for the location from a database of streets and other geo- graphic information. This action is shown as steps 1 through 3. The request (step SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 673 1) causes a program torun onthe server. The program consults a database to gen- erate theappropriate page (step 2)andreturns ittothebrowser (step3). 1 Web Program 2 page 3 DB 5 6 4 Program Program 7 Webbrowser Webserver Figure7-29. Dynamicpages. There is more to dynamic content, however', 'The page that is returned may it- self contain programs that run in the browser. In our map example, the program wouldlettheuserfindroutes andexplore nearby areas at different levels ofdetail. It would update the page, zooming in or out as directed by the user (step 4). To handle some interactions, the program may need more data from the server. In this case, the program will send a request to the server (step 5) that will retrieve more information from the database (step 6) and return a response (step 7). The program will then continue updating the page (step 4).The requests and responses happen in the background; the user may not even be aware of them because the page URL and title typically do not change. By including client-side programs, the page can present a more responsive interface than with server-side programs alone. Server-Side Dynamic WebPage Generation Let uslookatthecase ofserver-side content generation inmore detail. Asim- ple situation in which server-side processing is necessary is the use of forms. Consider the user filling out the AWI order form of Fig.7-25(b) and clicking the Submit order button. When the user clicks, a request is sent to the server at the URL specified with the form (a POST to http://widget.com/cgi-bin/order.cgi in this case) along with the contents of the form as filled in by the user. These data must be given to a program or script to process. Thus, the URL identifies the pro- gram to run; the data are provided to the program as input. In this case, proc- essing would involve entering the order in AWI’s internal system, updating custo- mer records, and charging the credit card. The page returned by this request will depend onwhat happens duringthe processing. Itisnotfixed like a static page. If the order succeeds, the page returned might give the expected shipping date. If it is unsuccessful, the returned page might say that widgets requested are out of stockorthecredit card wasnotvalidforsomereason. 674 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Exactly how the server runs a program instead of retrieving a file depends on the design of the Web server. It is not specified by the Web protocols themselves. This is because the interface can be proprietary and the browser does not need to know the details. As far as the browser isconcerned, it issimply making a request andfetching apage. Nonetheless, standard APIs have been developed for Web servers to invoke programs. The existence of these interfaces makes it easier for developers to ex- tend different servers with Web applications. We will briefly look at two APIs to giveyouasense ofwhat theyentail. The first API is a method for handling dynamic page requests that has been available since the beginning of the Web. It is called the CGI (Common Gate- way Interface) and is defined in RFC 3875. CGI provides an interface to allow Web servers to talk to back-end programs and scripts that can accept input (e.g., from forms) and generate HTML pages in response', 'These programs may be written in whatever language is convenient for the developer, usually a scripting language for ease of development. Pick Python, Ruby, Perl or your favorite lan- guage. By convention, programs invoked via CGI live in a directory called cgi-bin, which is visible in the URL. The server maps a request to this directory to a pro- gram name and executes that program as a separate process. It provides any data sent with the request as input to the program. The output of the program gives a Web page thatisreturned tothebrowser. Inourexample, theprogram order.cgi isinvokedwithinputfromtheformen- coded as shown in Fig.7-26. It will parse the parameters and process the order. A useful convention is that the program will return the HTML for the order form if no form input is provided. In this way, the program will be sure to know the representation oftheform. The second API we will look at is quite different. The approach here is to embed little scripts inside HTML pages and have them be executed by the server itself to generate the page. A popular language for writing these scripts is PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor). To use it, the server has to understand PHP, just as a browser has to understand CSS to interpret Web pages with style sheets. Usually, servers identify Web pages containing PHP from the file extension php rather thanhtmlorhtm. PHP is simpler to use than CGI. As an example of how it works with forms, see the example in Fig.7-30(a). The top part of this figure contains a normal HTML page with a simple form in it. This time, the <form> tag specifies that ac- tion.phpistobeinvokedtohandle theparameters whentheusersubmitstheform. The page displays two text boxes, one with a request for a name and one with a request for an age. After the two boxes have been filled in and the form submit- ted, the server parses the Fig.7-26-type string sent back, putting the name in the name variable and the age in the age variable. It then starts to process the ac- tion.php file, shown in Fig. 7-30(b), as a reply. During the processing of this file, SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 675 the PHP commands are executed. If the user filled in ‘‘Barbara’’ and ‘‘24’’ in the boxes, the HTML file sent back will be the one given in Fig. 7-30(c). Thus, han- dlingformsbecomes extremely simple usingPHP. <html> <body> <formaction=\"action.php\"method=\"post\"> <p>Pleaseenteryourname:<inputtype=\"text\"name=\"name\"></p> <p>Pleaseenteryourage:<inputtype=\"text\"name=\"age\"></p> <inputtype=\"submit\"> </form> </body> </html> (a) <html> <body> <h1>Reply:</h1> Hello<?phpecho$name;?>.

(a) AWebpagecontainingaform. (b)APHPscriptforhandling theoutputoftheform.(c)OutputfromthePHPscriptwhentheinputsare‘‘Bar- bara’’and‘‘32’’,respectively. Although PHP is easy to use, it is actually a powerful programming language forinterfacing theWebandaserver database. Ithasvariables, strings,arrays, and most of the control structures found in C, but much more powerful I/O than just printf. PHP is open source code, freely available, and widely used. It was de- signedspecifically toworkwell withApache, which isalso opensource and isthe world’s most widely used Web server. For more information about PHP, see Valade (2009)', 'We have now seen two different ways to generate dynamic HTML pages: CGI scripts and embedded PHP. There are several others to choose from. JSP (JavaServer Pages) is similar to PHP, except that the dynamic part is written in 676 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 the Java programming language instead of in PHP. Pages using this technique have the file extension .jsp. ASP.NET (Active Server Pages .NET) is Micro- soft’s version of PHP and JavaServer Pages. It uses programs written in Micro- soft’s proprietary .NET networked application framework for generating the dy- namic content. Pages using this technique have the extension .aspx. The choice among these three techniques usually has more to do with politics (open source vs. Microsoft) than with technology, since the three languages are roughly com- parable. Client-Side Dynamic WebPage Generation PHP and CGI scripts solve the problem of handling input and interactions with databases on the server. They can all accept incoming information from forms, look up information in one or more databases, and generate HTML pages with the results. What none of them can do is respond to mouse movements or interact with users directly. For this purpose, it is necessary to have scripts em- bedded in HTML pages that are executed on the client machine rather than the server machine. Starting with HTML 4.0, such scripts are permitted using the tag <script>. The technologies used to produce these interactive Web pages are broadly referred toasdynamic HTML The most popular scripting language for the client side is JavaScript, so we will now take a quick look at it. Despite the similarity in names, JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the Java programming language. Like other scripting languages, it is a very high-level language. For example, in a single line of JavaScript it is possible to pop up a dialog box, wait for text input, and store the resulting string in a variable. High-level features like this make JavaScript ideal for designing interactive Web pages. On the other hand, the fact that it is mutat- ing faster than a fruit fly trapped in an X-ray machine makes it extremely difficult to write JavaScript programs that work on all platforms, but maybe some day it willstabilize. As an example of a program in JavaScript, consider that of Fig.7-31. Like that of Fig.7-30, it displays a form asking for a name and age, and then predicts howoldtheperson willbe next year. The bodyisalmost the same as the PHP ex- ample, the main difference being the declaration of the Submit button and the assignment statement in it. This assignment statement tells the browser to invoke theresponsescript onabuttonclick andpassittheformasaparameter. What is completely new here is the declaration of the JavaScript function re- sponse in the head of the HTML file, an area normally reserved for titles, back- ground colors, and so on. This function extracts the value of the name field from the form and stores it in the variable person as a string', 'It also extracts the value of the age field, converts it to an integer by using the eval function, adds 1 to it, and stores the result in years. Then it opens a document for output, does four SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 677 <html> <head> <scriptlanguage=\"javascript\"type=\"text/javascript\"> functionresponse(test form){ varperson=test form.name.value; varyears=eval(test form.age.value)+1; document.open(); document.writeln(\"<html> <body>\"); document.writeln(\"Hello \"+person+\".<br>\"); document.writeln(\"Prediction: nextyearyouwillbe\"+years+\".\"); document.writeln(\"</body></html>\"); document.close(); } </script> </head> <body> <form> Pleaseenteryourname:<inputtype=\"text\"name=\"name\"> <p> Pleaseenteryourage:<inputtype=\"text\"name=\"age\"> <p> <inputtype=\"button\"value=\"submit\"onclick=\"response(this.form)\"> </form> </body> </html> Figure7-31. UseofJavaScriptforprocessingaform. writes to it using the writeln method, and closes the document. The document is an HTML file, as can be seen from the various HTML tags in it. The browser thendisplays thedocument onthescreen. It is very important to understand that while PHP and JavaScript look similar in that they both embed code in HTML files, they are processed totally dif- ferently. InthePHP example ofFig.7-30,after the user has clicked onthe submit button, the browser collects the information into a long string and sends it off to the server as a request for a PHP page. The server loads the PHP file and exe- cutes the PHP script that isembedded intoproduceanewHTML page. That page is sent back to the browser for display. The browser cannot even be sure that it was produced by a program. This processing is shown as steps 1 to 4 in Fig.7- 32(a). In the JavaScript example of Fig.7-31, when the submit button is clicked the browser interprets a JavaScript function contained on the page. All the work is done locally, inside the browser. There is no contact with the server. This proc- essing is shown as steps 1 and 2 in Fig. 7-32(b). As a consequence, the result is displayed virtually instantaneously, whereas withPHP there can beadelay ofsev- eral secondsbefore theresultingHTML arrives attheclient. 678 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Browser Server Browser Server User User 1 2 1 4 3 2 PHPmodule JavaScript (a) (b) Figure7-32. (a) Server-side scripting with PHP. (b) Client-side scripting with JavaScript. This difference does not mean that JavaScript is better than PHP. Their uses are completely different. PHP (and, by implication, JSP and ASP) is used when interaction with a database on the server is needed. JavaScript (and other client- side languages we will mention, such as VBScript) is used when the interaction is with the user at the client computer. It is certainly possible to combine them, as wewillsee shortly. JavaScript is not the only way to make Web pages highly interactive. An al- ternative on Windows platforms is VBScript, which is based on Visual Basic. Another popular method across platforms is the use of applets. These are small Java programs that have been compiled into machine instructions for a virtual computer called the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Applets can be embedded in HTML pages (between <applet> and </applet>) and interpreted by JVM-capable browsers. Because Java applets are interpreted rather than directly executed, the Java interpreter can prevent them from doing Bad Things. At least in theory. In practice, applet writers have founda nearly endless stream of bugs in the Java I/O libraries toexploit', 'Microsoft’s answer to Sun’s Java applets was allowing Web pages to hold ActiveX controls,whichare programs compiled tox86machine languageandex- ecuted on the bare hardware. This feature makes them vastly faster and more flexible than interpreted Java applets because they can do anything a program can do. When Internet Explorer sees an ActiveX control in a Web page, it downloads it, verifies its identity, and executes it. However, downloading and running for- eignprograms raises enormous security issues, which wewilldiscuss inChap. 8. Since nearly all browsers can interpret both Java programs and JavaScript, a designer whowants tomake a highlyinteractive Web page hasachoice ofatleast two techniques, and if portability to multiple platforms is not an issue, ActiveX in addition. As a general rule, JavaScript programs are easier to write, Java applets execute faster, and ActiveX controls run fastest of all. Also, since all browsers implement exactly the same JVM but no two browsers implement the same ver- sion of JavaScript, Java applets are more portable than JavaScript programs. For more information about JavaScript, there are many books, each with many (often withmore than1000)pages. See, forexample, Flanagan (2010). SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 679 AJAX—Asynchronous JavaScriptandXML Compelling Web applications need responsive user interfaces and seamless access to data stored on remote Web servers. Scripting on the client (e.g., with JavaScript) and the server (e.g., with PHP) are basic technologies that provide pieces of the solution. These technologies are commonly used with several other key technologies in a combination called AJAX (Asynchronous JAvascript and Xml). Many full-featured Web applications, such as Google’s Gmail, Maps, and Docs, are writtenwithAJAX. AJAX is somewhat confusing because it is not a language. It is a set of tech- nologies that work together to enable Web applications that are every bit as responsiveandpowerful astraditionaldesktop applications. The technologiesare: 1. HTML andCSS topresent information aspages. 2. DOM (Document Object Model) to change parts of pages while they are viewed. 3. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to let programs exchange ap- plication data withtheserver. 4. Anasynchronouswayforprograms tosendandretrieve XMLdata. 5. JavaScript asalanguagetobindallthisfunctionalitytogether. As this is quite a collection, we will go through each piece to see what it con- tributes. We have already seen HTML and CSS. They are standards for describ- ingcontent andhowit shouldbedisplayed. Any program that can produce HTML andCSScan useaWebbrowser asadisplay engine. DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of an HTML page that is accessible to programs. This representation is structured as a tree that reflects the structure of the HTML elements. For instance, the DOM tree of the HTML in Fig.7-30(a) is given in Fig. 7-33. At the root is an html element that represents the entire HTML block. This element is the parent of the body element, which is in turn parent to a form element. The form has two attributes that are drawn to the right-hand side, one for the form method (a POST) and one for the form action (the URL to request). This element has three children, reflecting the two para- graph tags and one input tag that are contained within the form', 'At the bottom of thetree are leaves thatcontain either elements orliterals,suchastextstrings. The significance of the DOM model is that it provides programs with a straightforward way to change parts of the page. There is no need to rewrite the entire page. Only the node that contains the change needs to be replaced. When this change is made, the browser will correspondingly update the display. For ex- ample, if an image on part of the page is changed in DOM, the browser will update that image without changing the other parts of the page. We have already seen DOM in action when the JavaScript example of Fig. 7-31 added lines to the 680 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 html Elements body Attributestotheright action=“action.php” Childelementsbelow form method=“post” p p input type=“submit” type=“txt” type=“txt” “Pleaseenter input “Pleaseenter input yourname:” name=“age” yourage:” name=“age” Figure7-33. TheDOMtreefortheHTMLinFig.7-30(a). document element to cause new lines of text to appear at the bottom of the brow- serwindow.The DOMisapowerful methodforproducingpages thatcan evolve. The third technology, XML (eXtensible Markup Language), is a language for specifying structured content. HTML mixes content with formatting because it is concerned with the presentation of information. However, as Web applica- tions become more common, there is an increasing need to separate structured content from its presentation. For example, consider a program that searches the Web for the best price for some book. It needs to analyze many Web pages look- ing for the item’s title and price. With Web pages in HTML, it is very difficult foraprogram tofigure outwhere thetitleisandwhere theprice is. For this reason, the W3C developed XML (Bray et al., 2006) to allow Web content to be structured for automated processing. Unlike HTML, there are no defined tags for XML. Each user can define her own tags. A simple example of an XML document is given in Fig.7-34. It defines a structure called book list, which is a list of books. Each book has three fields, the title, author, and year of publication. These structures are extremely simple. It is permitted to have struc- tures with repeated fields (e.g., multiple authors), optional fields (e.g., URL of the audio book), and alternative fields (e.g., URL of a bookstore if it is in print or URLofanauction site ifitisoutofprint). In this example, each of the three fields is an indivisible entity, but it is also permitted tofurther subdividethe fields. For example, the author field could have been doneasfollowstogivefiner-grained control oversearching andformatting: <author> <first name> George </first name> <last name> Zipf </last name> </author> Each field can besubdividedintosubfields andsubsubfields, arbitrarily deeply.

AsimpleXMLdocument. All the file of Fig. 7-34 does is define a booklist containing three books. It is well suited for transporting information between programs running in browsers andservers, butitsays nothing abouthowtodisplay the document as aWeb page. To do that, a program that consumes the information and judges 1949 to be a fine year forbooksmight output HTML inwhich the titlesare marked upas italic text', 'Alternatively, a language called XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Trans- formations), can be used to define how XML should be transformed into HTML. XSLT islikeCSS, butmuchmore powerful. We willspare youthedetails. The otheradvantage ofexpressing data inXML, instead ofHTML, isthat it is easier for programs to analyze. HTML was originally written manually (and often is still) so a lot of it is a bit sloppy. Sometimes the closing tags, like </p>, are left out. Other tags donothave a matching closing tag, like <br>. Still other tags may be nested improperly, and the case of tag and attribute names can vary. Most browsers do their best to work out what was probably intended. XML is stricter and cleaner in its definition. Tag names and attributes are always lowercase, tags must always be closed in the reverse of the order that they were opened (or indi- cate clearly if they are an empty tag with no corresponding close), and attribute values must be enclosed in quotation marks. This precision makes parsing easier andunambiguous. HTML is even being defined in terms of XML. This approach is called XHTML (eXtended HyperText Markup Language). Basically, it is a Very 682 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Picky version of HTML. XHTML pages must strictly conform to the XML rules, otherwise they are not accepted by the browser. No more shoddy Web pages and inconsistencies across browsers. As with XML, the intent is to produce pages that are better for programs (in this case Web applications) to process. While XHTML has been around since 1998, it has been slow to catch on. People who produce HTML do not see why they need XHTML, and browser support has lagged. Now HTML 5.0 is being defined so that a page can be represented as ei- ther HTML or XHTML to aid the transition. Eventually, XHTML should replace HTML, butitwillbealongtime before thistransitioniscomplete. XML has also proved popular as a language for communication between pro- grams. When this communication is carried by the HTTP protocol (described in the next section) it is called a Web service. In particular, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a way of implementing Web services that performs RPC be- tween programs in a language- and system-independent way. The client just con- structs the request as an XML message and sends it to the server, using the HTTP protocol. The server sends back a reply as an XML-formatted message. In this way, applications onheterogeneous platforms cancommunicate. Getting back to AJAX, our point is simply that XML is a useful format to ex- change data between programs running in the browser and the server. However, toprovide a responsiveinterfaceinthe browser while sending or receiving data, it must be possible for scripts to perform asynchronous I/O that does not block the display while awaiting the response to a request. For example, consider a map that can be scrolled in the browser. When it is notified of the scroll action, the script on the map page may request more map data from the server if the view of the map is near the edge of the data', 'The interface should not freeze while those data are fetched. Such an interface would win no user awards. Instead, the scrol- ling should continue smoothly. When the data arrive, the script is notified so that itcan usethedata. Ifallgoeswell, new map data willbe fetched before itisneed- ed. Modernbrowsers have supportforthismodelofcommunication. The final piece of the puzzle is a scripting language that holds AJAX together by providing access to the above list of technologies. In most cases, this language is JavaScript, but there are alternatives such as VBScript. We presented a simple example of JavaScript earlier. Do not be fooled by this simplicity. JavaScript has many quirks, butitisa full-blown programming language,withall the power of C or Java. It has variables, strings, arrays, objects, functions, and all the usual con- trol structures. It also has interfaces specific to the browser and Web pages. JavaScript can track mouse motion over objects on the screen, which makes it easy to make a menu suddenly appear and leads to lively Web pages. It can use DOM to access pages, manipulate HTML and XML, and perform asynchronous HTTP communication. Before leaving the subject of dynamic pages, let us briefly summarize the technologies we have covered so far by relating them on a single figure. Com- plete Web pages can be generated on the fly by various scripts on the server SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 683 machine. The scripts can be written in server extension languages like PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET, or run as separate CGI processes and thus be written in any lan- guage. These optionsare showninFig.7-35. Clientmachine Servermachine Javavirtual machine Webbrowser Webbrowser process process VBScript HTML/CSS PHP interpreter Helper etc. CGI ASP HTML/CSS/ application script XMLinterpreter JSP XML JavaScript Plug-ins interpreter Figure7-35. Varioustechnologiesusedtogeneratedynamicpages. Once these Web pages are received bythe browser, they are treated as normal pages in HTML, CSS and other MIME types and just displayed. Plug-ins that run in the browser and helper applications that run outside of the browser can be in- stalled toextend theMIMEtypesthatare supportedbythebrowser. Dynamic content generation is also possible on the client side. The programs that are embedded inWeb pages can be writteninJavaScript, VBScript, Java, and other languages. These programs can perform arbitrary computations and update the display. With AJAX, programs in Web pages can asynchronously exchange XMLandother kindsofdata withtheserver. This model supportsrich Web appli- cations that look just like traditional applications, except that they run inside the browser andaccessinformation thatisstoredatservers ontheInternet. 7.3.4 HTTP—The HyperText Transfer Protocol Now that we have an understanding of Web content and applications, it is time to look at the protocol that is used to transport all this information between Web servers and clients. It is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), as speci- fied inRFC 2616. HTTP is a simple request-response protocol that normally runs over TCP. It specifies what messages clients may send to servers and what responses they get back in return. The request and response headers are given in ASCII, just like in SMTP. The contents are given in a MIME-like format, also like in SMTP', 'This simple model was partly responsible for the early success of the Web because it made development anddeployment straightforward. In this section, we will look at the more important properties of HTTP as it is used nowadays. However, before getting into the details we will note that the way 684 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 it is used in the Internet is evolving. HTTP is an application layer protocol be- cause it runs on top of TCP and is closely associated with the Web. That is why we are covering it in this chapter. However, in another sense HTTP is becoming more like a transport protocol that provides a way for processes to communicate content across the boundaries of different networks. These processes do not have to be a Web browser and Web server. A media player could use HTTP totalk toa server and request album information. Antivirus software could use HTTP to download the latest updates. Developers could use HTTP to fetch project files. Consumer electronics products like digital photo frames often use an embedded HTTP server as an interface to the outside world. Machine-to-machine communi- cation increasingly runs over HTTP. For example, an airline server might use SOAP (an XML RPC over HTTP) to contact a car rental server and make a car reservation, all as part of a vacation package. These trends are likely to continue, alongwiththeexpanding useofHTTP. Connections The usual way for a browser to contact a server is to establish a TCP con- nection to port 80onthe server’s machine, althoughthisprocedure isnotformally required. The value of using TCP is that neither browsers nor servers have to worry about how to handle long messages, reliability, or congestion control. All ofthese matters are handled bytheTCP implementation. Early in the Web, with HTTP 1.0, after the connection was established a sin- glerequest wassent overandasingle responsewassentback. ThentheTCP con- nection was released. Inaworld inwhich the typical Web page consisted entirely of HTML text, this method was adequate. Quickly, the average Web page grew to contain large numbers of embedded links for content such as icons and other eye candy. Establishing a separate TCP connection to transport each single icon becameaveryexpensive waytooperate. This observation led to HTTP 1.1, which supports persistent connections. With them, it is possible to establish a TCP connection, send a request and get a response, and then send additional requests and get additional responses. This strategy is also called connection reuse. By amortizing the TCP setup, startup, and release costs over multiple requests, the relative overhead due to TCP is re- duced per request. It is also possible to pipeline requests, that is, send request 2 before theresponsetorequest 1hasarrived. The performance difference between these three cases is shown in Fig.7-36. Part (a) shows three requests, one after the other and each in a separate con- nection. Let us suppose that this represents a Web page with two embedded images on the same server. The URLs of the images are determined as the main page is fetched, so they are fetched after the main page', 'Nowadays, a typical page has around 40 other objects that must be fetched topresent it, butthat would make ourfigure fartoobigsowewilluseonlytwoembedded objects. SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 685 HTTP Connectionsetup Connectionsetup Connectionsetup Request HTTP Pipelined Response requests Connectionsetup Time Connectionsetup (a) (b) (c) Figure7-36. HTTP with (a) multiple connections and sequential requests. (b) Apersistentconnectionandsequentialrequests. (c)Apersistentconnectionand pipelinedrequests. In Fig.7-36(b), the page is fetched with a persistent connection. That is, the TCP connection is opened at the beginning, then the same three requests are sent, one after the other as before, and only then is the connection closed. Observe that the fetch completes more quickly. There are two reasons for the speedup. First, time is not wasted setting up additional connections. Each TCP connection re- quires at least one round-trip time to establish. Second, the transfer of the same images proceeds more quickly. Why is this? It is because of TCP congestion con- trol. Atthestart ofaconnection,TCP uses theslow-start procedure toincrease the throughput until it learns the behavior of the network path. The consequence of this warmup period is that multiple short TCP connections take disproportionately longertotransfer information thanonelongerTCP connection. Finally, inFig. 7-36(c), there is one persistent connection and the requests are pipelined. Specifically, the second and third requests are sent in rapid succession as soon as enough of the main page has been retrieved to identify that the images must be fetched. The responses for these requests follow eventually. This method cutsdownthetime thattheserver isidle,soitfurther improves performance. Persistent connections do not come for free, however. A new issue that they raise is when to close the connection. A connection to a server should stay open while the page loads. What then? There is a good chance that the user will click on a link that requests another page from the server. If the connection remains open, the next request can be sent immediately. However, there is no guarantee that the client will make another request of the server any time soon. In practice, 686 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 clients and servers usually keep persistent connections open until they have been idle for a short time (e.g., 60 seconds) or they have a large number of open con- nections andneedtoclose some. The observant reader may have noticed that there is one combination that we have left outsofar. Itisalso possible tosend one request per TCP connection,but run multiple TCP connections in parallel. This parallel connection method was widely used by browsers before persistent connections. It has the same disadvan- tage as sequential connections—extra overhead—but much better performance. This is because setting up and ramping up the connections in parallel hides some of the latency. In our example, connections for both of the embedded images could beset upat the same time. However, runningmany TCP connectionstothe same server is discouraged. The reason is that TCP performs congestion control for each connection independently', 'As a consequence, the connections compete against each other, causing added packet loss, and in aggregate are more aggres- sive users ofthe network than anindividual connection.Persistent connectionsare superior and used in preference to parallel connections because they avoid over- head anddonotsuffer fromcongestionproblems. Methods Although HTTP was designed for use in the Web, it was intentionally made more general than necessary with an eye to future object-oriented uses. For this reason, operations, called methods, other than just requesting a Web page are supported. ThisgeneralityiswhatpermittedSOAP tocome intoexistence. Each request consists of one or more lines of ASCII text, with the first word onthe first line being the name ofthe methodrequested. The built-inmethodsare listed inFig.7-37. Thenames are case sensitive,soGET isallowed butnotget.

Thebuilt-inHTTPrequestmethods. The GET method requests the server to send the page. (When we say ‘‘page’’ we mean ‘‘object’’ in the most general case, but thinking of a page as the contents SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 687 of a file is sufficient to understand the concepts.) The page is suitably encoded in MIME. The vast majority of requests to Web servers are GETs. The usual form ofGET is GETfilenameHTTP/1.1 where filenamenames thepage tobefetched and1.1istheprotocol version. The HEAD method just asks for the message header, without the actual page. This method can be used to collect information for indexing purposes, or just to test aURLforvalidity. The POST method is used when forms are submitted. Both it and GET are also used for SOAP Web services. Like GET, it bears a URL, but instead of sim- ply retrieving a page it uploads data to the server (i.e., the contents of the form or RPC parameters). The server then does something with the data that depends on the URL, conceptually appending the data to the object. The effect might be to purchase an item, for example, or to call a procedure. Finally, the method returns apage indicating theresult. The remaining methods are not used much for browsing the Web. The PUT methodisthe reverse ofGET:instead ofreading thepage, itwrites thepage. This method makes it possible to build a collection of Web pages on a remote server. The body of the request contains the page. It may be encoded using MIME, in which case the lines following the PUT might include authentication headers, to provethatthecaller indeed haspermission toperform therequested operation. DELETE does what you might expect: it removes the page, or at least it indi- cates that the Web server has agreed to remove the page. As with PUT, authentication andpermission playamajor role here. The TRACE method is for debugging. It instructs the server to send back the request. This method is useful when requests are not being processed correctly andtheclient wants toknowwhat request theserver actually got. The CONNECT method lets a user make a connection to a Web server throughanintermediate device, suchasaWebcache. The OPTIONS method provides a way for the client to query the server for a page andobtainthemethodsandheaders thatcan beusedwiththatpage', 'Every request gets a response consisting of a status line, and possibly addi- tional information (e.g., all or part of a Web page). The status line contains a three-digit status code telling whether the request was satisfied and, if not, why not. The first digit is used to divide the responses into five major groups, as shown in Fig. 7-38. The 1xx codes are rarely used in practice. The 2xx codes mean that the request was handled successfully and the content (if any) is being returned. The 3xx codes tell the client to look elsewhere, either using a different URL or in its own cache (discussed later). The 4xxcodes mean the request failed due to a client error such an invalid request or a nonexistent page. Finally, the 5xx errors mean the server itself has an internal problem, either due to an error in itscode ortoatemporary overload. 688 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Code Meaning Examples 1xx Information 100=serveragreestohandleclient’srequest 2xx Success 200=requestsucceeded;204=nocontentpresent 3xx Redirection 301=pagemoved;304=cachedpagestillvalid 4xx Clienterror 403=forbiddenpage;404=pagenotfound 5xx Servererror 500=internalservererror;503=tryagainlater Figure7-38. Thestatuscoderesponsegroups. Message Headers The request line (e.g., the line with the GET method) may be followed by ad- ditional lines with more information. They are called request headers. This information can be compared to the parameters of a procedure call. Responses may also have response headers. Some headers can be used in either direction. Aselection ofthe more important ones isgiven in Fig.7-39. This list is not short, soas youmight imagine there isoften a variety ofheaders oneachrequest and re- sponse. The User-Agent header allows the client to inform the server about its brow- ser implementation (e.g., Mozilla/5.0 and Chrome/5.0.375.125). This information is useful to let servers tailor their responses to the browser, since different brow- sers canhave widely varying capabilitiesandbehaviors. The four Accept headers tell the server what the client is willing to accept in the event that it has a limited repertoire of what is acceptable. The first header specifies theMIMEtypes that are welcome (e.g., text/html). The secondgives the character set (e.g., ISO-8859-5 or Unicode-1-1). The third deals with compres- sion methods (e.g., gzip). The fourth indicates a natural language (e.g., Spanish). If the server has a choice of pages, it can use this information to supply the one the client is looking for. If it is unable to satisfy the request, an error code is re- turned andtherequest fails. The If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match headers are used with caching. They let the client ask for a page to be sent only if the cached copy is no longer valid. We willdescribe cachingshortly. The Host header names the server. It is taken from the URL. This header is mandatory. It is used because some IP addresses may serve multiple DNS names andtheserver needs somewaytotell whichhosttohandtherequest to. The Authorization header is needed for pages that are protected. In this case, the client may have to prove it has a right to see the page requested. This header isusedforthatcase. The client uses the misspelled Referer header to give the URL that referred to the URL that is now requested', 'Most often this is the URL of the previous page.

SomeHTTPmessageheaders. This header is particularly useful for tracking Web browsing, as it tells servers howaclient arrived atthepage. Althoughcookies are dealt with in RFC 2109rather than RFC 2616, they also have headers. The Set-Cookie header is how servers send cookies to clients. The client is expected to save the cookie and return it on subsequent requests to the server by using the Cookie header. (Note that there is a more recent specification for cookies with newer headers, RFC 2965, but this has largely been rejected by industryandisnotwidely implemented.) 690 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Many other headers are used in responses. The Server header allows the ser- ver to identify its software build if it wishes. The next five headers, all starting withContent-,allow theserver todescribe properties ofthepage itissending. The Last-Modified header tells when the page was last modified, and the Ex- pires header tells for how long the page will remain valid. Both of these headers playanimportant roleinpagecaching. The Location header is used by the server to inform the client that it should try a different URL. This can be used if the page has moved or to allow multiple URLs to refer to the same page (possibly on different servers). It is also used for companies that have a main Web page in the com domain but redirect clients to a national orregional page based ontheir IPaddresses orpreferred language. If a page is very large, a small client may not want it all at once. Some ser- vers will accept requests for byte ranges, so the page can be fetched in multiple small units. The Accept-Ranges header announces the server’s willingness to handle thistypeofpartial page request. Now we come to headers that can be used in both directions. The Date head- er can be used in both directions and contains the time and date the message was sent, while the Range header tells the byte range of the page that is provided by theresponse. The ETag header gives a short tag that serves as a name for the content of the page. It is used for caching. The Cache-Control header gives other explicit in- structions abouthowtocache(or,moreusually, hownottocache)pages. Finally, the Upgrade header is used for switching to a new communication protocol, such as afuture HTTP protocol orasecure transport. Itallows theclient toannouncewhat itcan supportandtheserver toassert whatitisusing. Caching People often return to Web pages that they have viewed before, and related Web pages often have the same embedded resources', 'Some examples are the images that are used fornavigation across the site, as well as common style sheets and scripts. It would be very wasteful to fetch all of these resources for these pages eachtime theyare displayed becausethebrowser already hasacopy. Squirreling away pages that are fetched for subsequent use is called caching. The advantage is that when a cached page can be reused, it is not necessary to re- peat thetransfer. HTTP hasbuilt-insupporttohelp clients identify when they can safely reuse pages. This support improves performance byreducing bothnetwork traffic and latency. The trade-off is that the browser must now store pages, but this is nearly always a worthwhile trade-off because local storage is inexpensive. The pages are usually kept on disk so that they can be used when the browser is runatalater date. The difficult issue with HTTP caching is how to determine that a previously cached copy of a page is the same as the page would be if it was fetched again. SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 691 This determination cannot be made solely from the URL. For example, the URL may give a page that displays the latest news item. The contents of this page will be updated frequently even though the URL stays the same. Alternatively, the contents of the page may be a list of the gods from Greek and Roman mythology. Thispage shouldchange somewhat lessrapidly. HTTP uses twostrategies totackle thisproblem. They are shown in Fig.7-40 as forms ofprocessing between the request (step 1)andtheresponse(step 5). The first strategy is page validation (step 2). The cache is consulted, and if it has a copy of a page for the requested URL that is known to be fresh (i.e., still valid), there is no need to fetch it anew from the server. Instead, the cached page can be returned directly. The Expires header returned when the cached page was origi- nally fetched and the current date and time can be used to make this determina- tion. 1:Request 2:Checkexpiry 3:ConditionalGET 4a:Notmodified Program Cache 5:Response 4b:Response Webbrowser Webserver Figure7-40. HTTPcaching. However, notall pages come with aconvenientExpires header that tells when the page must be fetched again. After all, making predictions is hard—especially about the future. In this case, the browser may use heuristics. For example, if the page has not been modified in the past year (as told by the Last-Modified header) it is a fairly safe bet that it will not change in the next hour. There is no guaran- tee, however, and this may be a bad bet. For example, the stock market might have closed for the day so that the page will not change for hours, but it will change rapidly once the next trading session starts. Thus, the cacheability of a page may vary wildly over time. For this reason, heuristics should be used with care, thoughtheyoftenworkwell inpractice. Finding pages that have not expired is the most beneficial use of caching be- cause it means that the server does not need to be contacted at all. Unfortunately, it does not always work', 'Servers must use the Expires header conservatively, since they may be unsure when a page will be updated. Thus, the cached copies maystillbefresh, buttheclient doesnotknow. The second strategy is used in this case. It is to ask the server if the cached copyisstillvalid. This request isaconditional GET,anditisshowninFig.7-40 asstep3. Iftheserver knowsthatthecachedcopyisstillvalid, it can send a short reply tosayso(step 4a). Otherwise, itmustsendthefullresponse(step4b). 692 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 More header fields are used to let the server check whether a cached copy is still valid. The client has the time a cached page was last updated from the Last- Modified header. It can send this time to the server using the If-Modified-Since header toaskforthepageonlyifithasbeen changed inthemeantime. Alternatively, the server may return an ETag header with a page. This header gives a tag that is a short name for the content of the page, like a checksum but better. (It can be a cryptographic hash, which we will describe in Chap. 8.) The client can validate cached copies by sending the server an If-None-Match header listing the tags of the cached copies. If any of the tags match the content that the server would respond with, the corresponding cached copy may be used. This method can be used when it is not convenient or useful to determine freshness. For example, a server may return different content for the same URL depending on what languages and MIME types are preferred. In this case, the modification date alone willnothelptheserver todetermine ifthecachedpageisfresh. Finally, note that both of these caching strategies are overridden by the direc- tives carried in the Cache-Control header. These directives can be used to restrict caching (e.g., no-cache) when it is not appropriate. An example is a dynamic page that will be different the next time it is fetched. Pages that require authoriza- tionare alsonotcached. There is much more to caching, but we only have the space to make two im- portant points. First, caching can be performed at other places besides in the browser. In the general case, HTTP requests can be routed through a series of caches. The use of a cache external to the browser is called proxy caching. Each added level of caching can help to reduce requests further up the chain. It is com- mon for organizations such as ISPs and companies torunproxycaches togain the benefits of caching pages across different users. We will discuss proxy caching withthebroader topicofcontent distribution inSec. 7.5attheendofthischapter. Second,cachesprovide animportant boosttoperformance, butnotasmuchas one might hope. The reason is that, while there are certainly popular documents on the Web, there are also a great many unpopular documents that people fetch, many ofwhich are also verylong(e.g., videos). The ‘‘longtail’’ofunpopulardoc- uments take up space in caches, and the number of requests that can be handled from the cache grows only slowly with the size of the cache. Web caches are al- ways likely to be able to handle less than half of the requests. See Breslau et al. (1999)formore information', 'Experimenting with HTTP BecauseHTTP isanASCII protocol, it is quite easy for a person at a terminal (as opposed to a browser) to directly talk to Web servers. All that is needed is a TCP connection to port 80 on the server. Readers are encouraged to experiment with the following command sequence. It will work in most UNIX shells and the command windowonWindows(once the telnet program isenabled). SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 693 telnet www.ietf.org 80 GET /rfc.html HTTP/1.1 Host:www.ietf.org This sequence of commands starts up a telnet (i.e., TCP) connection to port 80 on IETF’s Web server, www.ietf.org. Then comes the GET command naming the path of the URL and the protocol. Try servers and URLs of your choosing. The next line is the mandatory Host header. A blank line following the last header is mandatory. It tells the server that there are no more request headers. The server willthen send the response.Depending onthe server and theURL, manydifferent kindsofheaders andpages can beobserved. 7.3.5 The Mobile Web The Web is used from most every type of computer, and that includes mobile phones. Browsing the Web over a wireless network while mobile can be very use- ful. It also presents technical problems because much Web content was designed for flashy presentations on desktop computers with broadband connectivity. In this section we will describe how Web access from mobile devices, or the mobile Web,isbeingdeveloped. Compared to desktop computers at work or at home, mobile phones present several difficultiesforWebbrowsing: 1. Relatively small screens preclude large pages andlarge images. 2. Limited input capabilities make it tedious to enter URLs or other lengthyinput. 3. Network bandwidth islimited overwireless links,particularly oncel- lular (3G)networks, where itisoftenexpensive too. 4. Connectivitymaybeintermittent. 5. Computing power is limited, for reasons of battery life, size, heat dissipation, andcost. These difficulties mean that simply using desktop content for the mobile Web is likely todeliver afrustrating userexperience. Early approaches to the mobile Web devised a new protocol stack tailored to wireless devices with limited capabilities. WAP (Wireless Application Proto- col)isthemostwell-knownexample ofthisstrategy. The WAP effort was started in 1997 by major mobile phone vendors that included Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola. However, something unexpected happened along the way. Over the next decade, network bandwidth and device capabilities grew tremendously with the deployment of 3G data services and mobile phones with larger color displays, 694 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 faster processors, and 802.11 wireless capabilities. All of a sudden, it was pos- sible for mobiles to run simple Web browsers. There is still a gap between these mobiles and desktops that will never close, but many of the technology problems thatgave impetus toaseparate protocol stack have faded. The approach that is increasingly used is to run the same Web protocols for mobiles anddesktops, andtohave Web sites deliver mobile-friendlycontent when theuserhappens tobeonamobiledevice. Web servers are able todetect whether to return desktop or mobile versions of Web pages bylookingat the request head- ers. The User-Agent header isespecially useful inthis regard because it identifies the browser software', 'Thus, when a Web server receives a request, it may look at the headers and return a page with small images, less text, and simpler navigation toaniPhoneandafull-featured page toauseronalaptop. W3C is encouraging this approach in several ways. One way is to standardize best practices for mobile Web content. A list of 60 such best practices is provided in the first specification (Rabin and McCathieNevile, 2008). Most of these prac- tices take sensible steps to reduce the size of pages, including by the use of com- pression, since the costs of communication are higher than those of computation, and by maximizing the effectiveness of caching. This approach encourages sites, especially large sites, to create mobile Web versions of their content because that is all that is required to capture mobile Web users. To help those users along, there isalsoalogotoindicate pages thatcan beviewed (well) onthemobile Web. Another useful tool is a stripped-down version of HTML called XHTML Basic. This language is a subset of XHTML that is intended for use by mobile phones, televisions, PDAs, vending machines, pagers, cars, game machines, and even watches. For this reason, it does not support style sheets, scripts, or frames, but most of the standard tags are there. They are grouped into 11 modules. Some are required; some are optional. All are defined in XML. The modules and some example tagsare listed inFig.7-41. However, not all pages will be designed to work well on the mobile Web. Thus, a complementary approach is the use of content transformation or trans- coding. In this approach, a computer that sits between the mobile and the server takes requests from the mobile, fetches content from the server, and transforms it to mobile Web content. A simple transformation is to reduce the size of large images by reformatting them at a lower resolution. Many other small but useful transformations are possible. Transcoding has been used with some success since the early days of the mobile Web. See, for example, Fox et al. (1996). However, when both approaches are used there is a tension between the mobile content de- cisions that are made bythe server andbythe transcoder. For instance, a Web site mayselect aparticular combination ofimage andtext fora mobile Web user, only tohave atranscoder change theformat oftheimage. Ourdiscussion sofar has been aboutcontent, notprotocols, as itisthe content that is the biggest problem inrealizing the mobile Web. However, we willbriefly mention the issue of protocols.

TheXHTMLBasicmodulesandtags. Web may consume a significant amount of bandwidth on protocol overheads such as headers. To tackle this problem, WAP and other solutions defined special-pur- pose protocols. This turns out to be largely unecessary. Header compression tech- nologies, such as ROHC (RObust Header Compression) described inChap', '6, can reduce the overheads of these protocols. In this way, it is possible to have one set of protocols (HTTP, TCP, IP) and use them over either high- or low- bandwidth links. Use over the low-bandwidth links simply requires that header compression beturnedon. 7.3.6 Web Search To finish our description of the Web, we will discuss what is arguably the most successful Web application: search. In 1998, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, then graduate students at Stanford, formed a startup called Google to build a bet- ter Web search engine. They were armed with the then-radical idea that a search algorithm that counted how many times each page was pointed to by other pages was a better measure of its importance than how many times it contained the key wordsbeing sought. For instance, many pages link tothe main Cisco page, which makes this page more important to a user searching for ‘‘Cisco’’ than a page out- sideofthecompany thathappens tousetheword‘‘Cisco’’manytimes. They were right. It did prove possible to build a better search engine, and people flocked to it. Backed by venture capital, Google grew tremendously. It became a public company in 2004, with a market capitalization of $23 billion. By 2010, it was estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers throughouttheworld. 696 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 In one sense, search is simply another Web application, albeit one of the most mature Web applications because it has been under development since the early days of the Web. However, Web search has proved indispensible in everyday usage. Over one billion Web searches are estimated to be done each day. People lookingfor all manner of information use search as a starting point. For example, to find out where to buy Vegemite in Seattle, there is no obvious Web site to use as a starting point. But chances are that a search engine knows of a page with the desired information andcan quicklydirect youtotheanswer. To perform a Web search in the traditional manner, the user directs her brow- ser to the URL of a Web search site. The major search sites include Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. Next, the user submits search terms using a form. This act causes the search engine to perform a query on its database for relevant pages or images, orwhatever kindofresource isbeingsearched for,andreturn the result as adynamicpage. The usercan thenfollowlinkstothepages thathave been found. Web search is an interesting topic for discussion because it has implications for the design and use ofnetworks. First, there isthe question ofhowWeb search finds pages. The Web search engine must have a database of pages to run a query. Each HTML page may contain links to other pages, and everything inter- esting (or at least searchable) is linked somewhere. This means that it is theoreti- cally possible to start with a handful of pages and find all other pages on the Web by doing a traversal of all pages and links. This process is called Web crawling. AllWeb search engines useWeb crawlers', 'One issue with crawling is the kind of pages that it can find. Fetching static documents and following links is easy. However, many Web pages contain pro- grams that display different pages depending on user interaction. An example is an online catalog for a store. The catalog may contain dynamic pages created from a product database and queries for different products. This kind of content is different from static pages that are easy to traverse. How do Web crawlers find these dynamic pages? The answer is that, for the most part, they do not. This kind of hidden content is called the deep Web. How to search the deep Web is an openproblem thatresearchers are nowtackling. See, forexample, madhavan etal. (2008). There are also conventions by which sites make a page (known as robots.txt)totellcrawlers whatparts ofthesites shouldorshouldnotbevisited. A second consideration is how to process all of the crawled data. To let indexing algorithms be run over the mass of data, the pages must be stored. Esti- mates vary, but the main search engines are thought to have an index of tens of billions of pages taken from the visible part of the Web. The average page size is estimated at 320 KB. These figures mean that a crawled copy of the Web takes on the order of 20 petabytes or 2×1016 bytes to store. While this is a truly huge number, it is also an amount of data that can comfortably be stored and processed in Internet data centers (Chang et al., 2006). For example, if disk storage costs $20/TB, then 2×104 TB costs $400,000, which is not exactly a huge amount for companies the size of Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!. And while the Web is SEC. 7.3 THEWORLDWIDEWEB 697 expanding, disk costs are dropping dramatically, so storing the entire Web may continue tobefeasible forlarge companies fortheforeseeablefuture. Making sense of this data is another matter. You can appreciate how XML can help programs extract the structure of the data easily, while ad hoc formats will lead to much guesswork. There is also the issue of conversion between for- mats, and even translation between languages. But even knowing the structure of data isonlypart ofthe problem. The hard bit is to understand what it means. This is where much value can be unlocked, starting with more relevant result pages for search queries. The ultimate goal is to be able to answer questions, for example, where tobuyacheap butdecenttoaster oveninyourcity. A third aspect of Web search is that it has come to provide a higher level of naming. There is no need to remember a long URL if it is just as reliable (or per- haps more) to search for a Web page by a person’s name, assuming that you are better at remembering names than URLs. This strategy is increasingly successful. In the same way that DNS names relegated IP addresses to computers, Web search is relegating URLs to computers. Also in favor of search is that it corrects spelling and typing errors, whereas if you type in a URL wrong, you get the wrongpage', 'Finally, Web search shows us something that has little to do with network de- sign but much to do with the growth of some Internet services: there is much money in advertising. Advertising is the economic engine that has driven the growth of Web search. The main change from print advertising is the ability to target advertisements depending on what people are searching for, to increase the relevance of the advertisements. Variations on an auction mechanism are used to match the search query tothe most valuable advertisement (Edelman et al., 2007). This new model has given rise tonew problems, ofcourse, such as click fraud,in which programs imitate users and click on advertisements to cause payments that have notbeen fairly earned. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIO AND VIDEO Web applications and the mobile Web are not the only exciting developments inthe use ofnetworks. Formany people, audio and video are the holygrail ofnet- working. When the word ‘‘multimedia’’ is mentioned, both the propellerheads and the suits begin salivating as if on cue. The former see immense technical challenges in providing voice over IP and video-on-demand to every computer. The latter see equally immense profits init. While the idea of sending audio and video over the Internet has been around since the 1970s at least, it is only since roughly 2000 that real-time audio and real-time video traffic has grown with a vengeance. Real-time traffic is different from Web traffic in that it must be played out at some predetermined rate to be useful. After all, watching a video in slow motion with fits and starts is not most 698 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 people’s idea of fun. In contrast, the Web can have short interruptions, and page loadscan take more orlesstime, within limits, withoutitbeingamajor problem. Two things happened to enable this growth. First, computers have became much more powerful andare equipped withmicrophonesandcameras sothatthey can input, process, and output audio and video data with ease. Second, a flood of Internet bandwidth has come tobeavailable. Long-haullinks inthecore oftheIn- ternet run at many gigabits/sec, and broadband and 802.11 wireless reaches users at the edge of the Internet. These developments allow ISPs to carry tremendous levels of traffic across their backbones and mean that ordinary users can connect totheInternet 100–1000times faster thanwitha56-kbpstelephonemodem. The flood of bandwidth caused audio and video traffic to grow, but for dif- ferent reasons. Telephone calls take up relatively little bandwidth (in principle 64 kbps but less when compressed) yet telephone service has traditionally been ex- pensive. Companies saw an opportunity to carry voice traffic over the Internet using existing bandwidth to cut down on their telephone bills. Startups such as Skype saw a way to let customers make free telephone calls using their Internet connections. Upstart telephone companies saw a cheap way to carry traditional voice calls using IP networking equipment. The result was an explosion of voice data carried over Internet networks that is called voice over IP or Internet telephony. Unlike audio, video takes up a large amount of bandwidth', 'Reasonable quali- ty Internet video is encoded with compression at rates of around 1 Mbps, and a typical DVD movie is 2GB of data. Before broadband Internet access, sending movies over the network was prohibitive. Not so any more. With the spread of broadband, it became possible for the first time for users to watch decent, stream- ed video at home. People love to do it. Around a quarter of the Internet users on any given day are estimated to visit YouTube, the popular video sharing site. The movie rental business has shifted to online downloads. And the sheer size of videos has changed the overall makeup of Internet traffic. The majority of Inter- net traffic is already video, and it is estimated that 90% of Internet traffic will be videowithin afew years (Cisco, 2010). Given that there is enough bandwidth to carry audio and video, the key issue for designing streaming and conferencing applications is network delay. Audio and video need real-time presentation, meaning that they must be played out at a predetermined rate to be useful. Long delays mean that calls that should be interactive no longer are. This problem is clear if you have ever talked on a satel- lite phone, where the delay of up to half a second is quite distracting. For playing music and movies over the network, the absolute delay does notmatter, because it only affects when the media starts to play. But the variation in delay, called jitter, still matters. It must be masked by the player or the audio will sound unin- telligibleandthe videowilllookjerky. Inthissection, wewilldiscuss somestrategies tohandle the delay problem, as well as protocols for setting up audio and video sessions. After an introduction to SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 699 digital audio and video, our presentation is broken into three cases for which dif- ferent designs are used. The first and easiest case to handle is streaming stored media, like watching a video on YouTube. The next case in terms of difficulty is streaming live media. Two examples are Internet radio and IPTV, in which radio and television stations broadcast to many users live on the Internet. The last and most difficult case is a call as might be made with Skype, or more generally an interactive audioandvideoconference. As an aside, the term multimedia is often used in the context of the Internet to mean video and audio. Literally, multimedia is just two or more media. That definition makes this book a multimedia presentation, as it contains text and graphics (the figures). However, that isprobably notwhat youhadinmind,sowe use the term ‘‘multimedia’’ to imply two or more continuous media, that is, media that have to be played during some well-defined time interval. The two media are normally video with audio, that is, moving pictures with sound. Many people also refer to pure audio, such as Internet telephony or Internet radio, as multimedia as well, which it is clearly not. Actually, a better term for all these cases is streaming media. Nonetheless, we will follow the herd and consider real-time audiotobemultimediaaswell', '7.4.1 Digital Audio An audio (sound) wave is a one-dimensional acoustic (pressure) wave. When an acoustic wave enters the ear, the eardrum vibrates, causing the tiny bones of the inner ear to vibrate along with it, sending nerve pulses to the brain. These pulses are perceived as sound by the listener. In a similar way, when an acoustic wave strikes a microphone, the microphone generates an electrical signal, repres- entingthesoundamplitudeasafunction oftime. The frequency range of the human ear runs from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Some animals, notably dogs, can hear higher frequencies. The ear hears loudness loga- rithmically, so the ratio of two sounds with power A and B is conventionally expressed in dB (decibels) as the quantity 10log (A/B). If we define the lower 10 limit of audibility (a sound pressure of about 20 μPascals) for a 1-kHz sine wave as 0 dB, an ordinary conversation is about 50 dB and the pain threshold is about 120dB.Thedynamicrange isafactor ofmore than1million. The ear is surprisingly sensitive to sound variations lasting only a few milliseconds. The eye, in contrast, does not notice changes in light level that last only a few milliseconds. The result of this observation is that jitter of only a few milliseconds during the playout of multimedia affects the perceived sound quality muchmore thanitaffects theperceived image quality. Digital audio is a digital representation of an audio wave that can be used to recreate it. Audio waves can be converted to digital form by an ADC (Analog- to-Digital Converter). An ADC takes an electrical voltage as input and gener- ates abinary number as output. InFig.7-42(a) we see anexample ofa sine wave. 700 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Torepresent this signal digitally, we can sample itevery ΔTseconds, as shown by the bar heights in Fig. 7-42(b). If a sound wave is not a pure sine wave but a linear superpositionofsine waves where the highest frequency componentpresent is f, the Nyquist theorem (see Chap. 2) states that it is sufficient to make samples atafrequency 2f. Sampling more oftenisofnovalue since the higher frequencies thatsuchsampling coulddetect are notpresent. 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0 1 T 1 T 1 T –0.25 2 T 2 T 2 T –0.50 –0.75 –1.00 (a) (b) (c) Figure7-42. (a) A sine wave. (b) Sampling the sine wave. (c) Quantizing the samplesto4bits. The reverse process takes digital values and produces an analog electrical voltage. It is done by a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). A loudspeaker can thenconverttheanalog voltage toacoustic waves sothatpeople canhear sounds. Digital samples are never exact. The samples of Fig. 7-42(c) allow only nine values, from −1.00 to +1.00 in steps of 0.25. An 8-bit sample would allow 256 distinct values. A16-bitsample wouldallow 65,536distinct values. The error in- troduced by the finite number of bits per sample is called the quantization noise. Ifitistoolarge, theear detects it. Two well-known examples where sampled sound is used are the telephone and audio compact discs. Pulse code modulation, as used within the telephone system, uses 8-bit samples made 8000times per second', 'The scale is nonlinear to minimize perceived distortion, and withonly8000samples/sec, frequencies above 4kHz are lost. In North America and Japan, the μ-law encoding is used. In Europe and internationally, the A-law encoding is used. Each encoding gives a data rate of64,000bps. Audio CDs are digital with a sampling rate of 44,100 samples/sec, enough to capture frequencies up to 22,050 Hz, which is good enough for people but bad for canine music lovers. The samples are 16bitseachandare linear over the range of amplitudes. Note that 16-bit samples allow only 65,536 distinct values, even though the dynamic range of the ear is more than 1 million. Thus, even though CD-quality audio is much better than telephone-quality audio, using only 16 bits per sample introduces noticeable quantization noise (although the full dynamic range is not covered—CDs are not supposed to hurt). Some fanatic audiophiles SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 701 stillprefer 33-RPM LP records to CDs because records donot have a Nyquist fre- quency cutoff at 22 kHz and have no quantization noise. (But they do have scratches unless handled very carefully) With 44,100 samples/sec of 16 bits each, uncompressed CD-quality audio needs a bandwidth of 705.6 kbps for monaural and1.411Mbpsforstereo. Audio Compression Audioisoftencompressed toreduce bandwidth needs andtransfer times, even though audio data rates are much lower than video data rates. All compression systems require two algorithms: one for compressing the data at the source, and another for decompressing it at the destination. In the literature, these algorithms are referred to as the encoding and decoding algorithms, respectively. We will usethisterminologytoo. Compression algorithms exhibit certain asymmetries that are important to un- derstand. Even though we are considering audio first, these asymmetries hold for video as well. For many applications, a multimedia document will only be en- coded once (when it is stored on the multimedia server) but will be decoded thou- sands oftimes (when it isplayed back bycustomers). This asymmetry means that it is acceptable for the encoding algorithm to be slow and require expensive hard- ware provided that the decoding algorithm is fast and does not require expensive hardware. The operator of a popular audio (or video) server might be quite wil- ling to buy a cluster of computers to encode its entire library, but requiring cus- tomers to do the same to listen to music or watch movies is not likely to be a big success. Many practical compression systems go to great lengths to make decod- ingfast andsimple, even attheprice ofmakingencoding slowandcomplicated. On the other hand, for live audio and video, such as a voice-over-IP calls, slow encoding is unacceptable. Encoding must happen on the fly, in real time. Consequently, real-time multimedia uses different algorithms or parameters than storedaudioorvideosondisk,oftenwithappreciably lesscompression. A second asymmetry is that the encode/decode process need not be invertible. That is, when compressing a data file, transmitting it, and then decompressing it, the user expects to get the original back, accurate down to the last bit. With mul- timedia, this requirement does notexist', 'It is usually acceptable to have the audio (or video) signal after encoding and then decoding be slightly different from the original as long as it sounds (or looks) the same. When the decoded output is not exactly equal to the original input, the system is said to be lossy. If the input and output are identical, the system is lossless. Lossy systems are important because accepting a small amount of information loss normally means a huge payoff in terms ofthecompression ratio possible. Historically, long-haul bandwidth in the telephone network was very expen- sive, sothere isasubstantial bodyofworkonvocoders (shortfor‘‘voice coders’’) that compress audio for the special case of speech. Human speech tends to be in 702 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 the 600-Hz to 6000-Hz range and is produced by a mechanical process that de- pends on the speaker’s vocal tract, tongue, and jaw. Some vocoders make use of models of the vocal system to reduce speech to a few parameters (e.g., the sizes and shapes of various cavities) and a data rate of as little as 2.4 kbps. How these vocoders workisbeyondthescope ofthisbook,however. We will concentrate on audio as sent over the Internet, which is typically closer to CD-quality. It is also desirable to reduce the data rates for this kind of audio. At 1.411 Mbps, stereo audio would tie up many broadband links, leaving less room for video and other Web traffic. Its data rate with compression can be reduced byanorderofmagnitude withlittletonoperceived lossofquality. Compression and decompression require signal processing. Fortunately, digi- tized sound and movies can be easily processed bycomputers in software. In fact, dozens of programs exist to let users record, display, edit, mix, and store media from multiple sources. This has led to large amounts of music and movies being available ontheInternet—not allofitlegal—which has resulted innumerous law- suitsfromtheartists andcopyrightowners. Many audio compression algorithms have been developed. Probably the most popular formats are MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3) and AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) as carried in MP4 (MPEG-4) files. To avoid confusion, note that MPEG provides audio and video compression. MP3 refers to the audio compres- sion portion (part 3) of the MPEG-1 standard, not the third version of MPEG. In fact, no third version of MPEG was released, only MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4. AAC is the successor to MP3 and the default audio encoding used in MPEG-4. MPEG-2 allows bothMP3 and AAC audio. Isthat clear now? The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from. And if you do not likeanyofthem, justwait ayear ortwo. Audio compression can be done in two ways. In waveform coding, the sig- nal is transformed mathematically by a Fourier transform into its frequency com- ponents. In Chap. 2, we showed an example function of time and its Fourier am- plitudes in Fig.2-1(a). The amplitude of each component is then encoded in a minimal way. The goal is to reproduce the waveform fairly accurately at the other endinasfew bitsaspossible', 'The other way, perceptual coding, exploits certain flaws in the human audi- tory system to encode a signal in such a way that it sounds the same to a human listener, even if it looks quite different on an oscilloscope. Perceptual coding is based on the science of psychoacoustics—how people perceive sound. Both MP3andAACare based onperceptual coding. The key property of perceptual coding is that some sounds can mask other sounds. Imagine youare broadcasting aliveflute concert onawarm summer day. Then all of a sudden, out of the blue, a crew of workmen nearby turn on their jackhammers and start tearing up the street. No one can hear the flute any more. Its sounds have been masked by the jackhammers. For transmission purposes, it is now sufficient to encode just the frequency band used by the jackhammers SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 703 because the listeners cannot hear the flute anyway. This is called frequency masking—the abilityofaloudsoundinonefrequency bandtohideasofter sound inanother frequency band that wouldhave been audible inthe absence ofthe loud sound. In fact, even after the jackhammers stop, the flute will be inaudible for a short period of time because the ear turns down its gain when they start and it takes afinite timetoturnitupagain. Thiseffect iscalled temporal masking. Tomake these effects morequantitative,imagine experiment 1. Aperson ina quiet room puts on headphones connected to a computer’s sound card. The com- puter generates a pure sine wave at 100 Hz at low, but gradually increasing, pow- er. The subject is instructed to strike a key when she hears the tone. The com- puter records the current power level and then repeats the experiment at 200 Hz, 300 Hz, and all the other frequencies up to the limit of human hearing. When averaged over many people, a log-log graph of how much power it takes for a tone to be audible looks like that of Fig.7-43(a). A direct consequence of this curve is that it is never necessary to encode any frequencies whose power falls below the threshold of audibility. For example, if the power at 100 Hz were 20 dB in Fig. 7-43(a), it could be omitted from the output with no perceptible loss of qualitybecause20dBat100Hzfalls below thelevel ofaudibility. 80 60 Threshold Masking ofaudibility signalat 40 150Hz 20 .1 1 Frequency(kHz) )Bd(rewoP Masked Threshold 80 signal ofaudibility 60 40 20 0 .02 .05 .2 .5 2 5 10 20 Frequency(kHz) (a) (b) )Bd(rewoP 0 .02 .05 .1 .2 .5 1 2 5 10 20 Figure7-43.

The computer runs experiment 1 again, but this time with aconstant-amplitudesinewave at,say, 150Hzsuperimposed onthetest frequency. What we discover is that the threshold of audibility for frequencies near 150Hzisraised, asshowninFig.7-43(b). The consequence of this new observation is that by keeping track of which signals are being masked bymore powerful signals innearby frequency bands, we can omit more and more frequencies in the encoded signal, saving bits. In Fig.7- 43, the 125-Hz signal can be completely omitted from the output and no one will be able to hear the difference', 'Even after a powerful signal stops in some fre- quency band, knowledge of its temporal masking properties allows us to continue to omit the masked frequencies for some time interval as the ear recovers. The 704 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 essence of MP3 and AAC is to Fourier-transform the sound to get the power at each frequency and then transmit only the unmasked frequencies, encoding these inasfew bitsaspossible. With this information as background, we can now see how the encoding is done. The audio compression is done by sampling the waveform at a rate from 8 to 96 kHz for AAC, often at 44.1 kHz, to mimic CD sound. Sampling can be done on one (mono) or two (stereo) channels. Next, the output bit rate is chosen. MP3can compress astereo rock’nrollCDdownto96kbpswith littleperceptible loss in quality, even for rock ’n roll fans with no hearing loss. For a piano con- cert, AAC with at least 128 kbps is needed. The difference is because the signal- to-noise ratio for rock ’n roll is much higher than for a piano concert (in an engin- eering sense, anyway). It is also possible to choose lower output rates and accept somelossinquality. The samples are processed in small batches. Each batch is passed through a bank of digital filters to get frequency bands. The frequency information is fed into a psychoacoustic model to determine the masked frequencies. Then the available bit budget is divided among the bands, with more bits allocated to the bands with the most unmasked spectral power, fewer bits allocated to unmasked bands with less spectral power, and no bits allocated to masked bands. Finally, the bits are encoded using Huffman encoding, which assigns short codes to num- bers that appear frequently and long codes to those that occur infrequently. There are many more details forthe curious reader. For more information, see Branden- burg(1999). 7.4.2 Digital Video Nowthatweknowallabouttheear, itistime tomoveontothe eye. (No, this section is not followed by one on the nose.) The human eye has the property that when an image appears on the retina, the image is retained for some number of milliseconds before decaying. If a sequence of images is drawn at 50 images/sec, the eye does not notice that it is looking at discrete images. All video systems exploit thisprinciple toproducemovingpictures. The simplest digital representation ofvideoisasequence offrames, eachcon- sisting of a rectangular grid of picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel can be a single bit, to represent either black or white. However, the quality of such a sys- tem is awful. Try using your favorite image editor to convert the pixels of a color image toblack andwhite (andnotshades ofgray). The next step up is to use 8 bits per pixel to represent 256 gray levels. This scheme gives high-quality ‘‘black-and-white’’ video. For color video, many sys- tems use 8 bits for each of the red, green and blue (RGB) primary color compo- nents. This representation ispossible becauseanycolor can beconstructed froma linear superposition of red, green, and blue with the appropriate intensities. With SEC', '7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 705 24 bits per pixel, there are about 16 million colors, which is more than the human eye can distinguish. On color LCD computer monitors and televisions, each discrete pixel is made up of closely spaced red, green and blue subpixels. Frames are displayed by set- tingtheintensity ofthesubpixels,andtheeye blendsthecolorcomponents. Common frame rates are 24 frames/sec (inherited from 35mm motion-picture film), 30 frames/sec (inherited from NTSC U.S. televisions), and 30 frames/sec (inherited fromthe PAL television system used innearly all the rest of the world). (For the truly picky, NTSC color television runsat 29.97frames/sec. The original black-and-white system ran at 30 frames/sec, but when color was introduced, the engineers needed a bit of extra bandwidth for signaling so they reduced the frame rate to 29.97. NTSC videos intended for computers really use 30.) PAL was in- vented after NTSC and really uses 25.000 frames/sec. To make this story com- plete, athirdsystem, SECAM, isusedinFrance, FrancophoneAfrica, and Eastern Europe. It was first introduced into Eastern Europe bythen Communist East Ger- many so the East German people could not watch West German (PAL) television lest they get Bad Ideas. But many of these countries are switching to PAL. Tech- nologyandpoliticsattheir best. Actually, for broadcast television, 25 frames/sec is not quite good enough for smooth motion so the images are split into two fields,one with the odd-numbered scan lines and one with the even-numbered scan lines. The two (half-resolution) fields are broadcast sequentially, giving almost 60 (NTSC) or exactly 50 (PAL) fields/sec, a system known as interlacing. Videos intended for viewing on a computer are progressive, that is, do not use interlacing because computer moni- tors have buffers on their graphics cards, making it possible for the CPU to put a new image in the buffer 30times/sec buthave the graphics card redraw the screen 50or even 100times/sec to eliminate flicker. Analog television sets do not have a frame buffer the way computers do. When an interlaced video with rapid move- ment is displayed on a computer, short horizontal lines will be visible near sharp edges, aneffect knownascombing. The frame sizes used for video sent over the Internet vary widely for the sim- ple reason that larger frames require more bandwidth, which may not always be available. Low-resolution video might be 320 by 240 pixels, and ‘‘full-screen’’ video is 640 by 480 pixels. These dimensions approximate those of early com- puter monitors and NTSC television, respectively. The aspect ratio, or width to height ratio, of 4:3, isthe same as astandard television. HDTV (High-Definition TeleVision) videos can be downloaded with 1280 by 720 pixels. These ‘‘widescreen’’ images have an aspect ratio of 16:9 to more closely match the 3:2 aspect ratio of film. For comparison, standard DVD video is usually 720 by 480 pixels, andvideoonBlu-ray discsisusually HDTV at1080by720pixels. On the Internet, the number of pixels is only part of the story, as media play- ers can present the same image at different sizes. Video is just another window on a computer screen that can be blown up or shrunk down', 'The role of more 706 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 pixels is to increase the quality of the image, so that it does not look blurry when it is expanded. However, many monitors can show images (and hence videos) witheven morepixels thanevenHDTV. Video Compression It should be obvious from our discussion of digital video that compression is critical for sending video over the Internet. Even a standard-quality video with 640by480pixel frames, 24bits of color information per pixel, and 30 frames/sec takes over 200 Mbps. This far exceeds the bandwidth bywhich most company of- fices are connected to the Internet, let alone home users, and this is for a single video stream. Since transmitting uncompressed video is completely out of the question, at least over wide area networks, the only hope is that massive compres- sion is possible. Fortunately, a large body of research over the past few decades has led tomany compression techniques andalgorithms that make video transmis- sionfeasible. Many formats are used for video that is sent over the Internet, some propri- etary and some standard. The most popular encoding is MPEG in its various forms. It is an open standard found in files with mpg and mp4 extensions, as well as in other container formats. In this section, we will look at MPEG to studyhow video compression is accomplished. To begin, we will look at the compression of still images with JPEG. A video is just a sequence of images (plus sound). One way to compress video is to encode each image in succession. To a first approxi- mation, MPEG is just the JPEG encoding of each frame, plus some extra features forremoving theredundancyacross frames. The JPEG Standard The JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) standard for compressing continuous-tone still pictures (e.g., photographs) was developed by photographic experts working under the joint auspices of ITU, ISO, and IEC, another standards body. It is widely used (look for files with the extension jpg) and often provides compression ratios of10:1orbetter fornatural images. JPEG is defined in International Standard 10918. Really, it is more like a shopping list than a single algorithm, but of the four modes that are defined only thelossysequential mode isrelevant toourdiscussion. Furthermore, we willcon- centrate on the way JPEG is normally used to encode 24-bit RGB video images andwillleave outsomeoftheoptionsanddetails forthesake ofsimplicity. The algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 7-44. Step 1 is block preparation. For the sake of specificity, let us assume that the JPEG input is a 640×480 RGB image with 24 bits/pixel, as shown in Fig. 7-44(a). RGB is not the best color model to use forcompression. The eye ismuch more sensitivetothe luminance,orbright- ness, of video signals than the chrominance, or color, of video signals. Thus, we SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 707 first compute the luminance, Y,andthe twochrominances, Cband Cr,from the R, G,andBcomponents. The following formulas are used for8-bit values that range from0to255: Y = 16+0.26R+0.50G+0.09B Cb=128+0.15R−0.29G−0.44B Cr =128+0.44R−0.37G+0.07B Input Discrete Run- Statistical Output Block Differential cosine Quantization length output preparation quantization transform encoding encoding Figure7-44. StepsinJPEGlossysequentialencoding. Separate matrices are constructed for Y, Cb, and Cr', 'Next, square blocks of four pixels are averaged in the Cb and Cr matrices to reduce them to 320×240. This reduction is lossy, but the eye barely notices it since the eye responds to luminance more than to chrominance. Nevertheless, it compresses the total amount of data by a factor of two. Now 128 is subtracted from each element of all three matrices to put 0 in the middle of the range. Finally, each matrix is divided up into 8×8 blocks. The Y matrix has 4800 blocks; the other two have 1200blockseach,asshowninFig. 7-45(b). 084 RGB Y Cb 640 640 (a) (b) Cr 084 042 320 042 8-Bitpixel 1Block 24-Bitpixel Block4799 Figure7-45.

If all the weights are 1, the transformation does nothing. However, if the weights increase sharply from the origin, higher spatial frequencies are droppedquickly. An example of this step is given in Fig.7-47. Here we see the initial DCT matrix, the quantization table, and the result obtained by dividing each DCT ele- ment by the corresponding quantization table element.

Theorderinwhichthequantizedvaluesaretransmitted. Now we have a list of numbers that represent the image (in transform space). Step 6 Huffman-encodes the numbers for storage or transmission, assigning com- monnumbers shorter codes thanuncommonones. JPEG may seem complicated, but that is because it is complicated. Still, the benefits of up to 20:1 compression are worth it. Decoding a JPEG image requires running the algorithm backward. JPEG is roughly symmetric: decoding takes as long as encoding. This property is not true of all compression algorithms, as we shall nowsee. The MPEG Standard Finally, we come to the heart of the matter: the MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) standards', 'Though there are many proprietary algorithms, these standards define the main algorithms used to compress videos. They have been international standards since 1993. Because movies contain both images and sound, MPEG can compress both audio and video. We have already examined audio compression and still image compression, so let us now examine video compression. The MPEG-1 standard (which includes MP3 audio) was first published in 1993 and is still widely used. Its goal was to produce video-recorder-quality out- putthatwas compressed 40:1torates ofaround1Mbps. Thisvideoissuitable for 710 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 broad Internet use on Web sites. Do not worry if you do not remember video recorders—MPEG-1 was also used for storing movies on CDs when they existed. IfyoudonotknowwhatCDsare, wewillhavetomoveontoMPEG-2. The MPEG-2 standard, released in 1996, was designed for compressing broadcast-qualityvideo. Itisvery commonnow,asitisusedasthebasisforvideo encoded on DVDs (which inevitably finds its way onto the Internet) and for digi- tal broadcast television (as DVB). DVD qualityvideo istypically encoded at rates of4–8Mbps. The MPEG-4 standard has two video formats. The first format, released in 1999, encodes video with an object-based representation. This allows for the mix- ing of natural and synthetic images and other kinds of media, for example, a weatherperson standing infront of a weather map. With thisstructure, it iseasy to let programs interact with movie data. The second format, released in 2003, is known as H.264 or AVC (Advanced Video Coding). Its goal is to encode video at half the rate of earlier encoders for the same quality level, all the better to sup- port the transmission of video over networks. This encoder is used for HDTV on mostBlu-ray discs. The details of all these standards are many and varied. The later standards also have many more features and encoding options than the earlier standards. However, we will not go into the details. For the most part, the gains in video compression over time have come from numerous small improvements, rather than fundamental shifts in how video is compressed. Thus, we will sketch the overall concepts. MPEG compresses both audio and video. Since the audio and video encoders work independently, there is an issue of how the two streams get synchronized at the receiver. The solution is to have a single clock that outputs timestamps of the current time to both encoders. These timestamps are included in the encoded out- putandpropagated all the way to the receiver, which can use them to synchronize theaudioandvideostreams. MPEG video compression takes advantage of two kinds of redundancies that exist in movies: spatial and temporal. Spatial redundancy can be utilized by sim- ply coding each frame separately with JPEG. This approach is occasionally used, especially when random access to each frame is needed, as in editing video prod- uctions. Inthismode,JPEG levels ofcompression are achieved. Additional compression can be achieved by taking advantage of the fact that consecutive frames are often almost identical. This effect is smaller than it might first appear since many movie directors cut between scenes every 3 or 4 seconds (time a movie fragment and count the scenes)', 'Nevertheless, runs of 75 or more highly similar frames offer the potential of a major reduction over simply en- codingeachframe separately withJPEG. For scenes in which the camera and background are stationary and one or two actors are movingaroundslowly, nearly all the pixels willbeidentical fromframe to frame. Here, just subtracting each frame from the previous one and running SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 711 JPEG on the difference would do fine. However, for scenes where the camera is panning or zooming, this technique fails badly. What is needed is some way to compensate forthis motion. This isprecisely what MPEG does; it isthemaindif- ference between MPEGandJPEG. MPEG outputconsists ofthree kindsofframes: 1. I-(Intracoded) frames: self-contained compressed stillpictures. 2. P- (Predictive) frames: block-by-block difference with the previous frames. 3. B- (Bidirectional) frames: block-by-block differences between previ- ousandfuture frames. I-frames are just still pictures. They can be coded with JPEG or something similar. It is valuable to have I-frames appear in the output stream periodically (e.g., once or twice per second) for three reasons. First, MPEG can be used for a multicast transmission, with viewers tuning in at will. If all frames depended on their predecessors going back to the first frame, anybody who missed the first frame could never decode any subsequent frames. Second, if any frame were re- ceived in error, no further decoding would be possible: everything from then on would be unintelligble junk. Third, without I-frames, while doing a fast forward or rewind the decoder would have to calculate every frame passed over so it wouldknowthefullvalue oftheoneitstoppedon. P-frames,incontrast, code interframedifferences. They are based onthe idea ofmacroblocks,whichcover, forexample, 16×16pixels inluminance spaceand 8×8 pixels in chrominance space. A macroblock is encoded by searching the previousframe foritorsomething onlyslightlydifferent fromit. An example of where P-frames would be useful is given in Fig.7-49. Here we see three consecutive frames that have the same background, but differ in the position of one person. The macroblocks containing the background scene will match exactly, but the macroblocks containing the person will be offset in posi- tionbysomeunknownamountandwillhave tobetracked down. Figure7-49. Threeconsecutiveframes. The MPEG standards do not specify how to search, how far to search, or how good a match has to be in order to count. This is up to each implementation. For 712 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 example, an implementation might search for a macroblock at the current position in the previous frame, and all other positions offset ±Δx in the x direction and ±Δyintheydirection. Foreachposition,thenumberofmatches inthe luminance matrix could be computed. The position with the highest score would be declared the winner, provided it was above some predefined threshold. Otherwise, the macroblock wouldbe said tobemissing. Much more sophisticatedalgorithms are alsopossible, ofcourse. If a macroblock is found, it is encoded by taking the difference between its current value and the one in the previous frame (for luminance and both chromi- nances). These difference matrices are then subjected to the discrete cosine transformation, quantization, run-length encoding, and Huffman encoding, as usual', 'The value for the macroblock in the output stream is then the motion vec- tor (how far the macroblock moved from its previous position in each direction), followed bythe encoding of its difference. If the macroblock is not located in the previousframe, thecurrent value isencoded, justasinanI-frame. Clearly, thisalgorithm ishighly asymmetric. An implementation is free totry every plausible positionin the previous frame ifit wants to,ina desperate attempt to locate every last macroblock, no matter where it has moved to. This approach will minimize the encoded MPEG stream at the expense of very slow encoding. This approach might be fine for a one-time encoding of a film library but would beterrible forreal-time videoconferencing. Similarly, each implementation is free to decide what constitutes a ‘‘found’’ macroblock. This freedom allows implementers to compete on the quality and speed oftheir algorithms, butalways producecompliant MPEGoutput. So far, decoding MPEG is straightforward. Decoding I-frames is similar to decoding JPEG images. Decoding P-frames requires the decoder to buffer the previous frames so it can build up the new one in a separate buffer based on fully encoded macroblocks and macroblocks containing differences from the previous frames. The newframe isassembled macroblock bymacroblock. B-frames are similar to P-frames, except that they allow the reference macro- block to be in either previous frames or succeeding frames. This additional free- dom allows for improved motion compensation. It is useful, for example, when objects pass infront of,orbehind, other objects. TodoB-frameencoding, the en- coder needs toholdasequence offrames inmemory at once: past frames, the cur- rent frame being encoded, and future frames. Decoding is similarly more compli- cated and adds some delay. This is because a given B-frame cannot be decoded until the successive frames on which it depends are decoded. Thus, although B- frames give the best compression, they are not always used due to their greater complexity andbuffering requirements. The MPEG standards contain many enhancements to these techniques to achieve excellent levels of compression. AVC can be used to compress video at ratios in excess of 50:1, which reduces network bandwidth requirements by the same factor. Formoreinformation onAVC, see SullivanandWiegand (2005). SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 713 7.4.3 Streaming Stored Media Let us now move on to network applications. Our first case is streaming me- dia that is already stored in files. The most common example of this is watching videos over the Internet. This is one form of VoD (Video on Demand). Other forms of video on demand use a provider network that is separate from the Inter- nettodeliver themovies (e.g., thecable network). In the next section, we will look at streaming live media, for example, broad- cast IPTV and Internet radio. Then we will look at the third case of real-time con- ferencing. An example is a voice-over-IP call or video conference with Skype. These three cases place increasingly stringent requirements on how we can deliv- er the audio and video over the network because we must pay increasing attention todelay andjitter. The Internet is full of music and video sites that stream stored media files', 'Actually, the easiest way to handle stored media is not to stream it. Imagine you want tocreate an online movie rental site tocompete withApple’s iTunes. Areg- ular Web site will let users download and then watch videos (after they pay, of course). The sequence of steps is shown in Fig.7-50. We will spell them out to contrast themwiththenextexample. Client Server 1:Mediarequest(HTTP) Media Web Browser player server 2:Mediaresponse(HTTP) 4:Play Disk 3:Save Disk media media Figure7-50. PlayingmediaovertheWebviasimpledownloads. The browser goes into action when the user clicks on a movie. In step 1, it sends an HTTP request for the movie to the Web server to which the movie is linked. Instep2,theserver fetches themovie(which isjustafile inMP4orsome other format) and sends it back to the browser. Using the MIME type, for ex- ample, video/mp4, the browser looks up how it is supposed to display the file. In this case, it is with a media player that is shown as a helper application, though it could also be a plug-in. The browser saves the entire movie to a scratch file on disk in step 3. It then starts the media player, passing it the name of the scratch file. Finally, in step 4 the media player starts reading the file and playing the movie. Inprinciple, thisapproach iscompletely correct. It willplay the movie. There is no real-time network issue to address either because the download is simply a 714 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 file download. The only trouble is that the entire video must be transmitted over the network before the movie starts. Most customers do not want to wait an hour for their ‘‘video on demand.’’ This model can be problematic even for audio. Im- agine previewing a song before purchasing an album. If the song is 4 MB, which is a typical size for an MP3 song, and the broadband connectivity is 1 Mbps, the user will be greeted by half a minute of silence before the preview starts. This modelisunlikely tosell manyalbums. To get around this problem without changing how the browser works, sites can use the design shown inFig.7-51. The page linked tothe movie isnottheac- tual movie file. Instead, it is what is called a metafile, a very short file just na- ming the movie (and possibly having other key descriptors). A simple metafile mightbeonlyonelineofASCII textandlooklikethis: rtsp://joes-movie-server/movie-0025.mp4 The browser gets the page as usual, now a one-line file, in steps 1 and 2. Then it starts the media player and hands it the one-line file in step 3, all as usual. The media player reads the metafile and sees the URL of where to get the movie. It contacts joes-video-server and asks for the movie in step 4. The movie is then streamed back tothe media player instep 5. The advantage ofthis arrangement is that the media player starts quickly, after only a very short metafile is download- ed. Once this happens, the browser is not in the loop any more. The media is sent directly to the media player, which can start showing the movie before the entire file hasbeen downloaded', 'Client Server 1:Metafilerequest(HTTP) Web Browser server 2:Metafileresponse(HTTP) 3:Handoff Server metafile 4:Mediarequest(RTSP) Media Media player server 5:Mediaresponse(viaTCPorUDP) Disk Figure7-51. StreamingmediausingtheWebandamediaserver. We have shown two servers in Fig.7-51 because the server named in the metafile is often not the same as the Web server. In fact, it is generally not even SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 715 anHTTP server, butaspecialized media server. Inthisexample, themedia server uses RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol), as indicated by the scheme name rtsp. The media player hasfourmajor jobstodo: 1. Manage theuserinterface. 2. Handle transmission errors. 3. Decompress thecontent. 4. Eliminate jitter. Most media players nowadays have a glitzy user interface, sometimes simulating a stereo unit, with buttons, knobs, sliders, and visual displays. Often there are interchangeable front panels, called skins, that the user can drop onto the player. The media player hastomanage allthisandinteract withtheuser. The other jobs are related and depend on the network protocols. We will go through each one in turn, starting with handling transmission errors. Dealing with errors depends on whether a TCP-based transport like HTTP is used to transport the media, or a UDP-based transport like RTP is used. Both are used in practice. If a TCP-based transport is being used then there are no errors for the media player to correct because TCP already provides reliability by using retransmis- sions. This is an easy way to handle errors, at least for the media player, but it doescomplicate theremoval ofjitterinalater step. Alternatively, a UDP-based transport like RTP can be used to move the data. We studied it in Chap. 6. With these protocols, there are no retransmissions. Thus, packet loss due to congestion or transmission errors will mean that some of themedia doesnotarrive. Itisuptothemedia player todeal withthisproblem. Let us understand the difficulty we are up against. The loss is a problem be- cause customers do not like large gaps in their songs or movies. However, it is not as much of a problem as loss in a regular file transfer because the loss of a small amount of media need not degrade the presentation for the user. For video, the user is unlikely to notice if there are occasionally 24 new frames in some sec- ondinstead of 25new frames. Foraudio, shortgaps inthe playoutcan be masked with sounds close in time. The user is unlikely to detect this substitution unless theyare payingvery close attention. The key tothe abovereasoning, however, is that the gaps are very short. Net- work congestionoratransmission error willgenerally cause anentire packet tobe lost, and packets are often lost in small bursts. Two strategies can be used to re- duce the impact of packet loss onthe media that islost: FEC andinterleaving. We willdescribe eachinturn. FEC (Forward Error Correction) is simply the error-correcting coding that we studied in Chap. 3 applied at the application level. Parity across packets pro- vides an example (Shacham and McKenny, 1990). For every four data packets 716 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 that are sent, a fifth parity packet can be constructed and sent. This is shown in Fig.7-52 with packets A, B, C, and D', 'The parity packet, P, contains redundant bits that are the parity or exclusive-OR sums of the bits in each of the four data packets. Hopefully, all of the packets will arrive for most groups of five packets. When this happens, the parity packet is simply discarded at the receiver. Or, if onlytheparity packet islost,noharm isdone. Client Server Lostpacket Paritypacket Repairloss: Constructparity: B = P + A Media A B C D P Media P = A + B + C + D player server + C + D Disk Figure7-52. Usingaparitypackettorepairloss. Occasionally, however, a data packet may be lost during transmission, as B is in Fig.7-52. The media player receives only three data packets, A, C, and D,plus the parity packet, P. By design, the bits in the missing data packet can be recon- structed from the parity bits. To be specific, using ‘‘+’’ torepresent exclusive-OR ormodulo2addition,Bcan be reconstructed as B =P +A +C +Dbythe proper- ties ofexclusive-OR (i.e., X +Y +Y =X). FEC can reduce the level of loss seen by the media player by repairing some of the packet losses, but it only works up to a certain level. If two packets in a group of five are lost, there is nothing we can do to recover the data. The other property to note about FEC is the cost that we have paid to gain this protection. Every four packets have become five packets, so the bandwidth requirements for the media are 25% larger. The latency of decoding has increased too, as we may need to wait until the parity packet has arrived before we can reconstruct a data packet thatcame before it. There is also one clever trick in the technique above. In Chap. 3, we de- scribed parity as providing error detection. Here we are providing error-cor- rection. How can it do both? The answer is that in this case it is known which packet was lost. The lost data is called an erasure. In Chap. 3, when we consid- ered a frame that was received with some bits inerror, we did not know which bit was errored. This case is harder to deal with than erasures. Thus, with erasures parity can provide error correction, and without erasures parity can only provide error detection. We will see another unexpected benefit of parity soon, when we gettomulticastscenarios. The second strategy is called interleaving. This approach is based on mixing up or interleaving the order of the media before transmission and unmixing or SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 717 deinterleaving it on reception. That way, if a packet (or burst of packets) is lost, the loss will be spread outover time bythe unmixing. It willnotresult inasingle, large gap when the media is played out. For example, a packet might contain 220 stereo samples, each containing a pair of 16-bit numbers, normally good for 5 msec of music. If the samples were sent in order, a lost packet would represent a 5 msec gap in the music. Instead, the samples are transmitted as shown in Fig.7- 53', 'All the even samples for a 10-msec interval are sent in one packet, followed by all the odd samples in the next one. The loss of packet 3 now does not repres- ent a 5-msec gap in the music, but the loss of every other sample for 10 msec. This loss can be handled easily by having the media player interpolate using the previous and succeeding samples. The result is lower temporal resolution for 10 msec, butnotanoticeabletime gapinthemedia. Thispacketcontains Thispacketcontains 220eventimesamples 220oddtimesamples Legend (a) Lost Eventime Packet 0 1 2 4 5 sample Oddtime sample (b) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Time(msec) Figure7-53. Whenpacketscarryalternatesamples,thelossofapacketreduces thetemporalresolutionratherthancreatingagapintime. This interleaving scheme above only works with uncompressed sampling. However, interleaving (over short periods of time, not individual samples) can also be applied after compression as long as there is a way to find sample bound- aries in the compressed stream. RFC 3119 gives a scheme that works with compressed audio. Interleaving isan attractive technique when it can be used because it needs no additional bandwidth, unlike FEC. However, interleaving adds tothe latency, just like FEC, because of the need to wait for a groupof packets to arrive (so they can bede-interleaved). The media player’s third jobis decompressing the content. Althoughthis task is computationally intensive, it is fairly straightforward. The thorny issue is how to decode media if the network protocol does not correct transmission errors. In many compression schemes, later data cannot be decompressed until the earlier data has been decompressed, because the later data is encoded relative to the ear- lier data. For aUDP-based transport, there can be packet loss. Thus, the encoding 718 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 process must be designed to permit decoding despite packet loss. This require- ment is why MPEG uses I-, P- and B-frames. Each I-frame can be decoded inde- pendently oftheother frames torecover fromthelossofanyearlier frames. The fourth job is to eliminate jitter, the bane of all real-time systems. The general solution that we described in Sec. 6.4.3 is to use a playout buffer. All streaming systems start by buffering 5–10 sec worth of media before starting to play, as shown in Fig. 7-54. Playing drains media regularly from the buffer so that the audio is clear and the video is smooth. The startup delay gives the buffer a chance to fill to the low-water mark. The idea is that data should now arrive regularly enough that the buffer is never completely emptied. If that were to hap- pen, the media playout would stall. The value of buffering is that if the data are sometimes slow to arrive due to congestion, the buffered media will allow the playouttocontinue normally untilnewmedia arrive andthebufferisreplenished. Clientmachine Servermachine Buffer Media Media player server Low- High- water water mark mark Figure7-54. The media player buffers input from the media server and plays fromthebufferratherthandirectlyfromthenetwork. How much buffering is needed, and how fast the media server sends media to fill up the buffer, depend on the network protocols. There are many possibilities', 'The largest factor in the design is whether a UDP-based transport or a TCP-based transport isused. Suppose that a UDP-based transport like RTP is used. Further suppose that there is ample bandwidth to send packets from the media server to the media player with little loss, and little other traffic in the network. In this case, packets can be sent at the exact rate that the media isbeing played. Each packet willtran- sitthenetwork and, after a propagation delay, arrive at aboutthe right time forthe media player to present the media. Very little buffering is needed, as there is no variabilityindelay. Ifinterleaving or FEC is used, more buffering is needed for at least the groupofpackets over which the interleaving orFEC isperformed. How- ever, thisaddsonlyasmall amountofbuffering. Unfortunately, this scenario is unrealistic in two respects. First, bandwidth varies over network paths, so it is usually not clear to the media server whether there will be sufficient bandwidth before it tries to stream the media. A simple solution is to encode media at multiple resolutions and let each user choose a SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 719 resolution that is supported by his Internet connectivity. Often there are just two levels: high quality, say, encoded at 1.5 Mbps or better, and low quality, say en- coded at512kbpsorless. Second, there will be some jitter, or variation inhow long it takes media sam- ples to cross the network. This jitter comes from two sources. There is often an appreciable amount of competing traffic in the network—some of which can come from multitasking users themselves browsing the Web while ostensibly watching a streamed movie). This traffic will cause fluctuations in when the media arrives. Moreover, we care about the arrival of video frames and audio samples, notpackets. With compression, video frames inparticular may be larger or smaller depending on their content. An action sequence will typically take more bits to encode than a placid landscape. If the network bandwidth is con- stant, the rate of media delivery versus time will vary. The more jitter, or varia- tion in delay, from these sources, the larger the low-water mark of the buffer needs tobetoavoidunderrun. NowsupposethataTCP-based transport likeHTTP isused tosend the media. By performing retransmissions and waiting to deliver packets until they are in order, TCP will increase the jitter that is observed by the media player, perhaps significantly. The result is that a larger buffer and higher low-water mark are needed. However, there isanadvantage. TCP willsend data as fast as the network will carry it. Sometimes media may be delayed if lossmust berepaired. But much of the time, the network will be able to deliver media faster than the player con- sumes it. In these periods, the buffer will fill and prevent future underruns. If the network issignificantly faster than the average media rate, as isoften the case, the buffer will fill rapidly after startup such that emptying it will soon cease to be a concern. With TCP, or with UDP and a transmission rate that exceeds the playout rate, aquestion ishowfarahead oftheplayoutpointthemedia player andmedia server are willingtoproceed. Often theyare willingtodownloadtheentire file', 'However, proceeding far ahead of the playout point performs work that is not yet needed, may require significant storage, and is not necessary to avoid buffer underruns. When it is not wanted, the solution is for the media player to define a high-water mark inthe buffer. Basically, the server justpumpsoutdata untilthe buffer is filled to the high-water mark. Then the media player tells it to pause. Since data will continue to pour in until the server has gotten the pause request, the distance between the high-water mark and the end of the buffer has to be greater than the bandwidth-delay product of the network. After the server has stopped, the buffer will begin to empty. When it hits the low-water mark, the media player tells the media server tostart again. To avoid underrun,the low-wa- ter mark must also take the bandwidth-delay product of the network into account whenaskingthemedia server toresume sendingthemedia. To start and stop the flow of media, the media player needs a remote control for it. This is what RTSP provides. It is defined in RFC 2326 and provides the 720 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 mechanism for the player to control the server. As well as starting and stopping the stream, it can seek back or forward to a position, play specified intervals, and play at fast or slow speeds. It does not provide for the data stream, though, which isusually RTP overUDPorRTP overHTTP overTCP. The main commands provided by RTSP are listed in Fig. 7-55. They have a simple text format, like HTTP messages, and are usually carried over TCP. RTSP can run over UDP too, since each command is acknowledged (and so can be resent ifitisnotacknowledged).

The main reason is that it is able to pass through firewalls more easily than UDP, especially when run over the HTTP port. Most administrators config- ure firewalls to protect their networks from unwelcome visitors. They almost al- ways allow TCP connections from remote port 80 to pass through for HTTP and Web traffic. Blocking that port quickly leads to unhappy campers. However, most other ports are blocked, including for RSTP and RTP, which use ports 554 and 5004, amongst others. Thus, the easiest way to get streaming media through the firewall is for the Web site to pretend it is an HTTP server sending a regular HTTP response,atleast tothefirewall. There are some other advantages of TCP, too. Because it provides reliability, TCP gives the client a complete copy of the media. This makes it easy for a user to rewind to a previously viewed playout point without concern for lost data. Finally, TCP will buffer as much of the media as possible as quickly as possible. When buffer space is cheap (which it is when the disk is used for storage), the media player can download the media while the user watches', 'Once the download is complete, the user can watch uninterrupted, even if he loses connectivity. This property is helpful for mobiles because connectivity can change rapidly with motion. The disadvantage of TCP is the added startup latency (because of TCP startup) and also a higher low-water mark. However, this is rarely much of a penalty aslongasthenetwork bandwidth exceedsthe media rate byalarge factor. SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 721 7.4.4 Streaming Live Media It is not only recorded videos that are tremendously popular on the Web. Live media streaming isverypopulartoo. Once itbecamepossibletostream audioand video over the Internet, commercial radio and TV stations got the idea of broad- casting their content over the Internet as well as over the air. Not so long after that, college stations started putting their signals out over the Internet. Then col- lege students started their ownInternet broadcasts. Today, people and companies of all sizes stream live audio and video. The area is a hotbed of innovation as the technologies and standards evolve. Live streaming is used for an online presence by major television stations. This is call- edIPTV (IPTeleVision). It isalso usedtobroadcast radio stations liketheBBC. This is called Internet radio. Both IPTV and Internet radio reach audiences worldwide for events ranging from fashion shows to World Cup soccer and test matches live from the MelbourneCricket Ground. Live streaming over IP is used as atechnologybycable providers tobuild their ownbroadcast systems. Andit is widely used bylow-budgetoperations fromadult sites tozoos. With current tech- nology,virtually anyonecan start livestreaming quicklyandwithlittleexpense. One approach to live streaming is to record programs to disk. Viewers can connect to the server’s archives, pull up any program, and download it for listen- ing. A podcast is an episode retrieved in this manner. For scheduled events, it is also possible to store content just after it is broadcast live, so the archive is only running,say, halfanhourorlessbehindthelivefeed. In fact, this approach is exactly the same as that used for the streaming media we just discussed. It is easy to do, all the techniques we have discussed work for it,andviewers can pickandchooseamongalltheprograms inthearchive. A different approach is to broadcast live over the Internet. Viewers tune in to an ongoing media stream, just like turning on the television. However, media players provide the added features of letting the user pause or rewind the playout. The live media will continue to be streamed and will be buffered by the player until the user is ready for it. From the browser’s point of view, it looks exactly like the case of streaming stored media. It does not matter to the player whether the content comes from a file or is being sent live, and usually the player will not be able to tell (except that it is not possible to skip forward with a live stream). Given the similarity of mechanism, much of our previous discussion applies, but there are alsosomekeydifferences. Importantly, there isstilltheneedforbuffering attheclient sidetosmooth out jitter. In fact, a larger amount of buffering is often needed for live streaming (in- dependent of the consideration that the user may pause playback)', 'When stream- ing from a file, the media can be pushed out at a rate that is greater than the play- back rate. This will build up a buffer quickly to compensate for network jitter (and the player will stop the stream if it does not want to buffer more data). In contrast, live media streaming is always transmitted at precisely the rate it is 722 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 generated, which is the same as the rate at which it is played back. It cannot be sent faster than this. Asa consequence, the buffer must be large enough to handle the full range of network jitter. In practice, a 10–15second startup delay isusual- lyadequate, sothisisnotalarge problem. The other important difference is that live streaming events usually have hun- dreds or thousands of simultaneous viewers of the same content. Under these cir- cumstances, the natural solution for live streaming is to use multicasting. This is not the case for streaming stored media because the users typically stream dif- ferent content at any given time. Streaming to many users then consists of many individual streaming sessionsthathappen tooccur atthesame time. Amulticaststreaming scheme worksasfollows. The server sends eachmedia packet once using IP multicast to a group address. The network delivers a copy of the packet toeachmember ofthe group.All ofthe clients whowant toreceive the stream have joined the group. The clients dothis using IGMP, rather than sending an RTSP message tothe media server. This is because the media server is already sending the live stream (except before the first user joins). What is needed is to arrange forthestream tobereceivedlocally. Since multicastisa one-to-many delivery service, the media is carried in RTP packets over a UDP transport. TCP only operates between a single sender and a single receiver. Since UDP does not provide reliability, some packets may be lost. To reduce the level of media loss toanacceptable level, we can use FEC and interleaving, asbefore. In the case of FEC, there is a beneficial interaction with multicast that is shown in the parity example of Fig.7-56. When the packets are multicast, dif- ferent clients may lose different packets. For example, client 1 has lost packet B, client 2lost the parity packet P,client 3lost D,andclient 4didnotlose anypack- ets. However, even though three different packets are lost across the clients, each client can recover all of the data packets in this example. All that is required is thateachclient lose nomore thanonepacket, whichever oneit may be, sothat the missing packet can be recovered by a parity computation. Nonnenmacher et al. (1997)describe howthisidea canbeusedtoboostreliability. For a server with a large number of clients, multicast of media in RTP and UDP packets is clearly the most efficient way to operate. Otherwise, the server must transmit N streams when it has N clients, which will require a very large amountofnetwork bandwidth attheserver forlarge streaming events. It may surprise you to learn that the Internet does not work like this in prac- tice', 'What usually happens is that each user establishes a separate TCP con- nection to the server, and the media is streamed over that connection. To the cli- ent, this is the same as streaming stored media. And as with streaming stored media, there are several reasons forthisseemingly poorchoice. The first reason is that IP multicast is not broadly available on the Internet. Some ISPs and networks supportit internally, butit isusually notavailable across network boundaries as is needed for wide-area streaming. The other reasons are SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 723 P D C B A Client1 Parity RTP/UDP Differentpacketslost packet datapacket P D C B A P D C B A Client2 Server Multicast P D C B A Client3 P D C B A Client4 Figure7-56. Multicaststreamingmediawithaparitypacket. the same advantages of TCP over UDP as discussed earlier. Streaming with TCP will reach nearly all clients on the Internet, particularly when disguised as HTTP to pass through firewalls, and reliable media delivery allows users to rewind easi- ly. There is one important case in which UDP and multicast can be used for streaming, however: within a provider network. For example, a cable company might decide to broadcast TV channels to customer set-top boxes using IP tech- nology instead of traditional video broadcasts. The use of IP to distribute broad- cast video is broadly called IPTV, as discussed above. Since the cable company has complete control of its own network, it can engineer it to support IP multicast and have sufficient bandwidth for UDP-based distribution. All of this is invisible to the customer, as the IP technology exists within the walled garden of the pro- vider. It looks just like cable TV in terms of service, but it is IP underneath, with the set-top box being a computer running UDP and the TV set being simply a monitorattached tothecomputer. Back to the Internet case, the disadvantage of live streaming over TCP is that the server must send a separate copy of the media for each client. This is feasible for a moderate number of clients, especially for audio. The trick is to place the server atalocation withgoodInternet connectivitysothat there issufficient band- width. Usually this means renting a server in a data center from a hosting pro- vider, not using a server at home with only broadband Internet connectivity. There isaverycompetitivehostingmarket, sothisneed notbeexpensive. In fact, it is easy for anybody, even a student, to set up and operate a stream- ing media server such as an Internet radio station. The main components of this 724 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 station are illustrated in Fig.7-57. The basis of the station is an ordinary PC with a decent sound card and microphone. Popular software is used to capture audio andencode itinvariousformats, forexample, MP4, andmedia players are used to listen totheaudioasusual. Microphone Media Audio player Codec captureplug-in plug-in Media Internet server TCPconnections Student’sPC tolisteners Figure7-57. Astudentradiostation. The audio stream captured on the PC is then fed over the Internet to a media server with goodnetwork connectivity, either as podcasts forstored file streaming or for live streaming', 'The server handles the task of distributing the media via large numbers of TCP connections. It also presents a front-end Web site with pages about the station and links to the content that is available for streaming. There are commercial software packages for managing all the pieces, as well as opensource packages suchasicecast. However, fora very large number of clients, it becomes infeasible to use TCP to send media to each client from a single server. There is simply not enough bandwidth tothe oneserver. For large streaming sites, the streaming is done using a set of servers that are geographically spread out, so that a client can connect to the nearest server. This is a content distribution network that we will study at the endofthechapter. 7.4.5 Real-Time Conferencing Once uponatime, voice calls were carried over the public switched telephone network, and network traffic was primarily voice traffic, with a little bit of data traffic here andthere. Then came the Internet, and the Web. The data traffic grew andgrew, untilby1999there was asmuchdata traffic asvoice traffic (since voice is now digitized, both can be measured in bits). By 2002, the volume of data traf- fic was an order of magnitude more than the volume of voice traffic and still growingexponentially,withvoice traffic stayingalmost flat. The consequence of this growth has been to flip the telephone network on its head. Voice traffic isnowcarried usingInternet technologies,and represents only SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 725 a tiny fraction of the network bandwidth. This disruptive technology is known as voice over IP,andalsoasInternet telephony. Voice-over-IPisusedinseveral forms thatare driven bystrongeconomicfac- tors. (English translation: it saves money so people use it.) One form is to have what look like regular (old-fashioned?) telephones that plug into the Ethernet and send calls over the network. Pehr Anderson was an undergraduate student at M.I.T. when he and his friends prototyped this design for a class project. They got a ‘‘B’’ grade. Not content, he started a company called NBX in 1996, pioneered this kind of voice over IP, and sold it to 3Com for $90 million three years later. Companies love this approach because it lets them do away with sep- arate telephonelinesandmake dowiththenetworks thattheyhavealready. Another approach is to use IP technology to build a long-distance telephone network. In countries such as the U.S., this network can be accessed for competi- tive long-distance service by dialing a special prefix. Voice samples are put into packets that are injected into the network and pulled out of the packets when they leave it. Since IPequipment ismuchcheaper than telecommunications equipment thisleads tocheaper services. As an aside, the difference in price is not entirely technical. For many dec- ades, telephone service was a regulated monopolythat guaranteed the phonecom- panies a fixed percentage profit over their costs. Notsurprisingly, thisled them to run up costs, for example, by having lots and lots of redundant hardware, justified in the name of better reliability (the telephone system was only allowed to be down for a total of 2 hours every 40 years, or 3 min/year on average)', 'This effect was often referred to as the ‘‘gold-plated telephone pole syndrome.’’ Since dereg- ulation, the effect has decreased, of course, but legacy equipment still exists. The IT industry never had any history operating like this, so it has always been lean andmean. However, we will concentrate on the form of voice over IP that is likely the most visible to users: using one computer to call another computer. This form became commonplace as PCs began shipping with microphones, speakers, cam- eras, andCPUs fast enoughtoprocess media, andpeople started connectingtothe Internet from home at broadband rates. A well-known example is the Skype soft- ware that was released starting in 2003. Skype and other companies also provide gateways to make it easy to call regular telephone numbers as well as computers withIPaddresses. As network bandwidth increased, video calls joined voice calls. Initially, video calls were in the domain of companies. Videoconferencing systems were designed to exchange video between two or more locations enabling executives at different locations to see each other while they held their meetings. However, with goodbroadband Internet connectivity and video compression software, home users can also videoconference. Tools such as Skype that started as audio-only now routinely include video with the calls so that friends and family across the worldcansee aswell ashear eachother. 726 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 From our point of view, Internet voice or video calls are also a media stream- ing problem, butone that is much more constrained than streaming astored file or a live event. The added constraint is the low latency that is needed for a two-way conversation. The telephone network allows a one-way latency of up to 150 msec for acceptable usage, after which delay begins to be perceived as annoying by the participants. (International calls may have a latency of up to 400 msec, by which pointtheyare far fromapositiveuserexperience.) This low latency is difficult to achieve. Certainly, buffering 5–10 seconds of media is not going to work (as it would for broadcasting a live sports event). In- stead, video and voice-over-IP systems must be engineered with a variety of tech- niques tominimize latency. Thisgoalmeans starting withUDPastheclear choice rather than TCP, because TCP retransmissions introduce at least one round-trip worth of delay. Some forms of latency cannot be reduced, however, even with UDP. For example, the distance between Seattle and Amsterdam is close to 8,000km. The speed-of-light propagation delay for this distance in optical fiber is 40 msec. Good luck beating that. In practice, the propagation delay through the network will be longer because it will cover a larger distance (the bits do not fol- low a great circle route) and have transmission delays as each IP router stores and forwards apacket. Thisfixed delay eats intotheacceptabledelay budget. Another source of latency is related to packet size. Normally, large packets are the best way to use network bandwidth becausethey are more efficient. How- ever, at an audio sampling rate of 64kbps, a 1-KB packet would take 125msec to fill (and even longer if the samples are compressed)', 'This delay would consume most of the overall delay budget. In addition, if the 1-KB packet is sent over a broadband access link that runs at just 1Mbps, it will take 8 msec to transmit. Then add another 8 msec for the packet to go over the broadband link at the other end.Clearly, large packets willnotwork. Instead, voice-over-IP systems use short packets to reduce latency at the cost of bandwidth efficiency. They batch audio samples in smaller units, commonly 20 msec. At 64 kbps, this is 160 bytes of data, less with compression. However, by definition the delay from this packetization will be 20 msec. The transmission delay will be smaller as well because the packet is shorter. In our example, it would reduce to around 1 msec. By using short packets, the minimum one-way delay for a Seattle-to-Amsterdam packet has been reduced from an unacceptable 181msec (40+125+16)toanacceptable62msec (40+20+2). We have not even talked about the software overhead, but it, too, will eat up some of the delay budget. This is especially true for video, since compression is usually needed to fit video into the available bandwidth. Unlike streaming from a stored file, there is no time to have a computationally intensive encoder for high levels ofcompression. The encoder andthedecoder mustbothrunquickly. Buffering isstillneeded toplay outthe media samples ontime (to avoid unin- telligible audio or jerky video), but the amount of buffering must be kept very small since the time remaining in our delay budget is measured in milliseconds. SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 727 When a packet takes too long to arrive, the player will skip over the missing sam- ples, perhaps playing ambient noise or repeating a frame to mask the loss to the user. There is a trade-off between the size of the buffer used to handle jitter and the amount of media that is lost. A smaller buffer reduces latency but results in more loss due to jitter. Eventually, as the size of the buffer shrinks, the loss will become noticeabletotheuser. Observant readers may have noticed that we have said nothing about the net- work layer protocols so far in this section. The network can reduce latency, or at least jitter, byusing quality of service mechanisms. The reason that this issue has not come up before is that streaming is able to operate with substantial latency, even in the live streaming case. If latency is not a major concern, a buffer at the end host is sufficient to handle the problem of jitter. However, for real-time con- ferencing, it is usually important to have the network reduce delay and jitter to help meet the delay budget. The only time that it is not important is when there is somuchnetwork bandwidth thateveryonegetsgoodservice. In Chap. 5, we described two quality of service mechanisms that help with this goal. One mechanism is DS (Differentiated Services), in which packets are marked as belonging to different classes that receive different handling within the network. The appropriate marking for voice-over-IP packets is low delay', 'In practice, systems set the DS codepoint to the well-known value for the Expedited Forwarding class with Low Delay type of service. This is especially useful over broadband access links, as these links tend to be congested when Web traffic or other traffic competes for use of the link. Given a stable network path, delay and jitterare increased bycongestion. Every 1-KB packet takes 8msec tosend over a 1-Mbps link, and a voice-over-IP packet will incur these delays if it is sitting in a queue behind Web traffic. However, with a low delay marking the voice-over-IP packets will jump to the head of the queue, bypassingthe Web packets andlower- ingtheir delay. The second mechanism that can reduce delay is tomake sure that there is suf- ficient bandwidth. If the available bandwidth varies or the transmission rate fluc- tuates (as with compressed video) and there is sometimes not sufficient band- width, queues will build up and add to the delay. This will occur even with DS. To ensure sufficient bandwidth, a reservation can be made with the network. This capability is provided by integrated services. Unfortunately, it is not widely de- ployed. Instead, networks are engineered for an expected traffic level or network customers are provided with service-level agreements for a given traffic level. Applications must operate below this level to avoid causing congestion and intro- ducing unnecessary delays. For casual videoconferencing at home, the user may choose a video quality as a proxy for bandwidth needs, or the software may test thenetwork pathandselect anappropriate qualityautomatically. Any of the above factors can cause the latency to become unacceptable, so real-time conferencing requires that attention be paid to all of them. For an over- viewofvoice overIPandanalysis ofthese factors, see Goode(2002). 728 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 Now that we have discussed the problem of latency in the media streaming path, we will move on to the other main problem that conferencing systems must address. This problem is how to set up and tear down calls. We will look at two protocols that are widely used for this purpose, H.323 and SIP. Skype is another important system, butitsinner workingsare proprietary. H.323 One thing that was clear to everyone before voice and video calls were made over the Internet was that if each vendor designed its own protocol stack, the sys- tem would never work. To avoid this problem, a number of interested parties got together under ITU auspices to work out standards. In 1996, ITU issued recom- mendation H.323, entitled ‘‘Visual Telephone Systems and Equipment for Local Area Networks Which Provide a Non-Guaranteed Quality of Service.’’ Only the telephoneindustrywouldthink of such a name. It was quickly changed to‘‘Pack- et-based Multimedia Communications Systems’’ in the 1998 revision. H.323 was the basis for the first widespread Internet conferencing systems. It remains the mostwidely deployed solution,initsseventh versionasof2009. H.323 is more of an architectural overview of Internet telephony than a spe- cific protocol. It references a large number of specific protocols for speech cod- ing, call setup, signaling, data transport, and other areas rather than specifying these things itself', 'The general model is depicted in Fig. 7-58. At the center is a gateway that connects the Internet to the telephone network. It speaks the H.323 protocols on the Internet side and the PSTN protocols on the telephone side. The communicating devices are called terminals. A LAN may have a gatekeeper, whichcontrols theendpointsunderitsjurisdiction, called azone. Zone Terminal Gateway Gatekeeper Telephone Internet network Figure7-58. TheH.323architectural modelforInternettelephony. A telephone network needs a number of protocols. To start with, there is a protocol for encoding and decoding audio and video. Standard telephony repres- entations of a single voice channel as 64 kbps of digital audio (8000 samples of 8 bits per second) are defined in ITU recommendation G.711. All H.323 systems SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 729 must support G.711. Other encodings that compress speech are permitted, but not required. They use different compression algorithms and make different trade- offs between quality and bandwidth. For video, the MPEG forms of video com- pression thatwedescribed aboveare supported,including H.264. Since multiple compression algorithms are permitted, a protocol is needed to allow the terminals to negotiate which one they are going to use. This protocol is called H.245. It also negotiates other aspects of the connection such as the bit rate. RTCP is need for the control of the RTP channels. Also required is a proto- col for establishing and releasing connections, providing dial tones, making ring- ing sounds, and the rest of the standard telephony. ITU Q.931 is used here. The terminals need a protocol for talking to the gatekeeper (if present) as well. For this purpose, H.225 is used. The PC-to-gatekeeper channel it manages is called the RAS (Registration/Admission/Status) channel. This channel allows termi- nals to join and leave the zone, request and return bandwidth, and provide status updates, among other things. Finally, a protocol is needed for the actual data transmission. RTP over UDP isused forthispurpose. Itismanaged byRTCP, as usual. Thepositioningofallthese protocols isshowninFig.7-59. Audio Video Control G.7xx H.26x H.245 H.225 Q.931 RTCP (Call (RAS) (Signaling) RTP Control) UDP TCP IP Linklayerprotocol Physicallayerprotocol Figure7-59. TheH.323protocolstack. To see how these protocols fit together, consider the case of a PC terminal on a LAN (with a gatekeeper) calling a remote telephone. The PC first has to dis- cover the gatekeeper, so it broadcasts a UDP gatekeeper discovery packet to port 1718. When the gatekeeper responds, the PC learns the gatekeeper’s IP address. Now the PC registers with the gatekeeper by sending it a RAS message in a UDP packet. After it has been accepted, the PC sends the gatekeeper a RAS admission message requesting bandwidth. Only after bandwidth has been granted may call setup begin. The idea of requesting bandwidth in advance is to allow the gate- keeper to limit the number of calls. It can then avoid oversubscribing the out- goinglineinordertohelpprovidethenecessaryqualityofservice. 730 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 As an aside, the telephone system does the same thing. When you pick up the receiver, a signal is sent to the local end office. If the office has enough spare ca- pacity for another call, it generates a dial tone', 'If not, you hear nothing. Nowa- days, the system is so overdimensioned that the dial tone is nearly always in- stantaneous, but in the early days of telephony, it often took a few seconds. So if yourgrandchildren ever ask you‘‘Why are there dial tones?’’nowyouknow. Ex- cept bythen,probably telephoneswillnolongerexist. The PC now establishes a TCP connection to the gatekeeper to begin call setup. Call setup uses existing telephonenetwork protocols, which are connection oriented, so TCP is needed. In contrast, the telephone system has nothing like RAS to allow telephones to announce their presence, so the H.323 designers were free touseeither UDPorTCP forRAS, andtheychose thelower-overhead UDP. Now that it has bandwidth allocated, the PC can send a Q.931 SETUP mes- sage over the TCP connection. This message specifies the number of the tele- phonebeing called (orthe IP address andport, ifa computer isbeing called). The gatekeeper responds with aQ.931CALL PROCEEDING message toacknowledge correct receipt of the request. The gatekeeper then forwards the SETUP message tothegateway. The gateway, which is half computer, half telephone switch, then makes an ordinary telephone call to the desired (ordinary) telephone. The end office to which the telephone is attached rings the called telephone and also sends back a Q.931 ALERT message to tell the calling PC that ringing has begun. When the person at the other end picks up the telephone, the end office sends back a Q.931 CONNECT message tosignal thePCthatithasaconnection. Once the connection has been established, the gatekeeper is no longer in the loop, although the gateway is, of course. Subsequent packets bypass the gate- keeper and go directly to the gateway’s IP address. At this point, we just have a bare tube running between the two parties. This is just a physical layer con- nection for moving bits, no more. Neither side knows anything about the other one. The H.245 protocol is now used to negotiate the parameters of the call. It uses the H.245 control channel, which is always open. Each side starts out by announcing its capabilities, for example, whether it can handle video (H.323 can handle video) or conference calls, which codecs it supports, etc. Once each side knows what the other one can handle, two unidirectional data channels are set up and a codec and other parameters are assigned to each one. Since each side may have different equipment, itisentirely possible that the codecs onthe forward and reverse channels are different. After all negotiations are complete, data flow can begin using RTP. It is managed using RTCP, which plays a role in congestion control. If video is present, RTCP handles the audio/video synchronization. The various channels are shown in Fig.7-60. When either party hangs up, the Q.931 call signaling channel is used to tear down the connection after the call has been completed inordertofree upresources nolongerneeded.

Logicalchannelsbetweenthecallerandcalleeduringacall. When the call isterminated, the callingPC contacts the gatekeeper again with a RAS message to release the bandwidth it has been assigned. Alternatively, it can make another call', 'We have not said anything about quality of service as part of H.323, even though we have said it is an important part of making real-time conferencing a success. The reason is that QoS falls outside the scope of H.323. If the underly- ing network is capable of producing a stable, jitter-free connection from the cal- ling PC tothe gateway, the QoS onthe call will be good; otherwise, it will notbe. However, any portion of the call on the telephone side will be jitter-free, because thatishowthetelephonenetwork isdesigned. SIP—The Session Initiation Protocol H.323 was designed by ITU. Many people in the Internet community saw it as a typical telco product: large, complex, and inflexible. Consequently, IETF set up a committee to design a simpler and more modular way to do voice over IP. The major result to date is SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). The latest version is described in RFC 3261, which was written in 2002. This protocol describes how to set up Internet telephone calls, video conferences, and other multimedia connections. Unlike H.323, which is a complete protocol suite, SIP is a single module, but it has been designed to interwork well with existing Internet applica- tions. For example, it defines telephonenumbers as URLs, sothat Web pages can contain them, allowing a click on a link to initiate a telephone call (the same way the mailto scheme allows a click on a link to bring up a program to send an email message). SIP can establish two-party sessions (ordinary telephone calls), multiparty sessions (where everyone can hear and speak), andmulticastsessions (one sender, many receivers). The sessions may contain audio, video, or data, the latter being useful for multiplayer real-time games, for example. SIP just handles setup, man- agement, and termination of sessions. Other protocols, such as RTP/RTCP, are 732 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 also used for data transport. SIP is an application-layer protocol and can run over UDPorTCP, asrequired. SIP supports a variety of services, including locating the callee (who may not be at his home machine) and determining the callee’s capabilities, as well as han- dling the mechanics of call setup and termination. In the simplest case, SIP sets upa session from the caller’s computer tothe callee’s computer, sowewillexam- inethatcase first. Telephone numbers in SIP are represented as URLs using the sip scheme, for example, sip:ilse@cs.university.edu for a user named Ilse at the host specified by the DNS name cs.university.edu. SIP URLs may also contain IPv4 addresses, IPv6addresses, oractual telephonenumbers. The SIP protocol isatext-based protocol modeled onHTTP. One party sends a message in ASCII text consisting of a method name on the first line, followed by additional lines containing headers for passing parameters. Many of the head- ers are taken from MIME to allow SIP tointerwork with existing Internet applica- tions. The sixmethodsdefined bythecore specification are listed inFig.7-61.

Inbothcases, the headers onthe secondand subsequent lines describe the structure of the message body, which contains the caller’s capabilities, media types, and formats. If the callee accepts the call, it responds with an HTTP-type reply code (a three-digit number using the groups of Fig.7-38, 200 for ac- ceptance).

SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIOANDVIDEO 733 The REGISTER methodrelates toSIP’s abilitytotrack down and connect toa user who is away from home. This message is sent to a SIP location server that keeps track of who is where. That server can later be queried to find the user’s current location. The operation of redirection is illustrated in Fig.7-62. Here, the caller sendstheINVITE message toaproxyserver tohide the possible redirection. The proxythen looksupwhere theuserisandsendstheINVITE message there. It then acts as a relay for the subsequent messages in the three-way handshake.

It also has the ability to place calls from a computer to an ordinary telephone, if a suitable gateway be- tween theInternet andtelephonesystem isavailable. Comparison ofH.323andSIP Both H.323 and SIP allow two-party and multiparty calls using both com- puters and telephones as end points. Both support parameter negotiation, en- cryption, and the RTP/RTCP protocols. A summary of their similarities and dif- ferences isgiveninFig.7-63. Although the feature sets are similar, the two protocols differ widely in philo- sophy. H.323 is a typical, heavyweight, telephone-industry standard, specifying the complete protocol stack and defining precisely what is allowed and what is forbidden. This approach leads to very well defined protocols in each layer, eas- ing the task of interoperability. The price paid is a large, complex, and rigid stan- dardthatisdifficult toadapt tofuture applications. In contrast, SIP is a typical Internet protocol that works by exchanging short lines of ASCII text. It is a lightweight module that interworks well with other In- ternet protocols but less well with existing telephone system signaling protocols. 734 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP', '7 Item H.323 SIP Designedby ITU IETF CompatibilitywithPSTN Yes Largely CompatibilitywithInternet Yes,overtime Yes Architecture Monolithic Modular Completeness Fullprotocolstack SIPjusthandlessetup Parameternegotiation Yes Yes Callsignaling Q.931overTCP SIPoverTCPorUDP Messageformat Binary ASCII Mediatransport RTP/RTCP RTP/RTCP Multipartycalls Yes Yes Multimediaconferences Yes No Addressing URLorphonenumber URL Calltermination ExplicitorTCPrelease Explicitortimeout Instantmessaging No Yes Encryption Yes Yes Sizeofstandards 1400pages 250pages Implementation Largeandcomplex Moderate,butissues Status Widespread,esp.video Alternative,esp.voice Figure7-63.

The downside is that is has suffered from ongoing interoperability problems as people try to interpret what the standard means. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY The Internet used to be all about communication, like the telephone network. Early on, academics would communicate with remote machines, logging in over the network to perform tasks. People have used email to communicate with each other for a long time, and now use video and voice over IP as well. Since the Web grew up,however, the Internet has become more about content than commu- nication. Many people use the Web tofindinformation, andthere isatremendous amount of peer-to-peer file sharing that is driven by access to movies, music, and programs. The switch to content has been so pronounced that the majority of In- ternet bandwidth isnowusedtodeliver stored videos. SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 735 Because the task of distributing content is different from that of communica- tion, it places different requirements on the network. For example, if Sally wants to talk to Jitu, she may make a voice-over-IP call to his mobile. The communica- tion must be with a particular computer; it will do no good to call Paul’s com- puter. But if Jitu wants to watch his team’s latest cricket match, he is happy to stream video from whichever computer can provide the service. He does notmind whether the computer is Sally’s or Paul’s, or, more likely, an unknown server in the Internet. That is, location does not matter for content, except as it affects per- formance (andlegality). The other difference is that some Web sites that provide content have become tremendously popular. YouTube is a prime example. It allows users to share videos of their own creation on every conceivable topic. Many people want to do this. The rest of us want to watch. With all of these bandwidth-hungry videos, it isestimated thatYouTube accountsforupto10%ofInternet traffic today. Nosingle server ispowerful orreliable enoughtohandle such a startling level of demand. Instead, YouTube and other large content providers build their own content distribution networks. These networks use data centers spread around the world to serve content to an extremely large number of clients with good per- formance andavailability. The techniques that are used for content distribution have been developed over time. Early in the growth of the Web, its popularity was almost its undoing. More demands for content led to servers and networks that were frequently overloaded. Manypeople began tocall theWWWtheWorld Wide Wait', 'In response to consumer demand, very large amounts of bandwidth were pro- visioned in the core of the Internet, and faster broadband connectivity was rolled out at the edge of the network. This bandwidth was key to improving per- formance, but it is only part of the solution. To reduce the endless delays, re- searchers also developed different architectures to use the bandwidth for distribut- ingcontent. One architecture is a CDN (Content Distribution Network). In it, a pro- vider sets up a distributed collection of machines at locations inside the Internet anduses them toserve content toclients. Thisisthe choice ofthe big players. An alternative architecture is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) network. In it, a collection of computers pool their resources to serve content to each other, without separately provisioned servers or any central point of control. This idea has captured peo- ple’s imagination because, by acting together, many little players can pack an enormouspunch. In this section, we will look at the problem of distributing content on the In- ternet and some of the solutions that are used in practice. After briefly discussing content popularity and Internet traffic, we will describe how to build powerful Web servers and use caching to improve performance for Web clients. Then we will come to the two main architectures for distributing content: CDNs and P2P networks. There designandproperties are quitedifferent, aswewillsee. 736 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 7.5.1 Content and Internet Traffic Todesign andengineer networks that work well, we need an understanding of the traffic that they must carry. With the shift to content, for example, servers have migrated from company offices to Internet data centers that provide large numbers of machines with excellent network connectivity. To run even a small server nowadays, itiseasier andcheaper torent a virtual server hosted inanInter- net data center than to operate a real machine in a home or office with broadband connectivitytotheInternet. Fortunately, there are onlytwofacts aboutInternet traffic that is it essential to know. The first fact is that it changes quickly, not only in the details but in the overall makeup. Before 1994, most traffic was traditional FTP file transfer (for moving programs and data sets between computers) and email. Then the Web ar- rived and grew exponentially. Web traffic left FTP and email traffic in the dust longbefore thedotcombubbleof2000.Starting around2000,P2Pfile sharing for music and then movies took off. By 2003, most Internet traffic was P2P traffic, leaving the Web in the dust. Sometime in the late 2000s, video streamed using content distribution methods by sites like YouTube began to exceed P2P traffic. By 2014, Cisco predicts that 90% of all Internet traffic will be video in one form oranother (Cisco, 2010). It is not always traffic volume that matters. For instance, while voice-over-IP traffic boomed even before Skype started in 2003, it will always be a minor blip on the chart because the bandwidth requirements of audio are two orders of mag- nitude lower than for video. However, voice-over-IP traffic stresses the network in other ways because it is sensitive to latency', 'As another example, online social networks have grown furiously since Facebook started in 2004. In 2010, for the first time, Facebook reached more users on the Web per day than Google. Even putting the traffic aside (and there is an awful lot of traffic), online social net- works are important because they are changing the way that people interact via theInternet. The pointweare makingisthatseismic shifts inInternet traffic happen quick- ly, and with some regularity. What will come next? Please check back in the 6th editionofthisbookandwewillletyouknow. The second essential fact about Internet traffic is that it is highly skewed. Many properties with which we are familiar are clustered around an average. For instance, most adults are close to the average height. There are some tall people and some short people, but few very tall or very short people. For these kinds of properties, itispossible todesign forarange that isnot very large butnonetheless captures themajority ofthepopulation. Internet traffic is not like this. For a long time, it has been known that there are a small number of Web sites with massive traffic and a vast number of Web site with much smaller traffic. This feature has become part of the language of networking. Early papers talked about traffic in terms of packet trains, the idea SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 737 being that express trains with a large number of packets would suddenly travel down a link (Jain and Routhier, 1986). This was formalized as the notion of self- similarity, which for our purposes can be thought of as network traffic that exhi- bits many short and many long gaps even when viewed at different time scales (Leland et al., 1994). Later work spoke of long traffic flows as elephants and short traffic flows as mice. The idea is that there are only a few elephants and manymice, buttheelephants matter becausethey are sobig. Returning to Web content, the same sort of skew is evident. Experience with video rental stores, public libraries, and other such organizations shows that not all items are equally popular. Experimentally, when N movies are available, the fraction of all requests for the kth most popular one is approximately C/k. Here, Ciscomputed tonormalize thesumto1,namely, C =1/(1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+ ... +1/N) Thus, the most popular movie is seven times as popular as the number seven movie. This result is known as Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949). It is named after George Zipf,a professor oflinguisticsat Harvard University whonoted that the frequency of a word’s usage in a large body of text is inversely proportional to its rank. For example, the 40th most common word is used twice as much as the 80th most commonwordandthree times asmuchasthe120thmostcommonword. A Zipf distribution is shown in Fig.7-64(a). It captures the notion that there are a small number of popular items and a great many unpopular items. To recog- nize distributions of this form, it is convenient to plot the data on a log scale on bothaxes, asshowninFig. 7-64(b). Theresult shouldbeastraight line. 1 (a) ycneuqerFevitaleR 0 1 5 10 15 20 Rank ycneuqerFevitaleR 100 10–1 10–2 1 101 102 Rank (b) Figure7-64. Zipfdistribution(a)Onalinearscale.(b)Onalog-logscale', 'When people looked at the popularity of Web pages, it also turned out to roughly follow Zipf’s law (Breslau et al., 1999). A Zipf distribution is one ex- ample in a family of distributions known as power laws. Power laws are evident 738 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 in many human phenomena, such as the distribution of city populations and of wealth. Theyhave thesame propensity todescribe a few large players andagreat many smaller players, and they too appear as a straight line on a log-log plot. It was soon discovered that the topology of the Internet could be roughly described with power laws (Faloutsos et al., 1999). Next, researchers began plotting every imaginable property of the Internet on a log scale, observing a straight line, and shouting:‘‘Power law!’’ However, what matters more than a straight line on a log-log plot is what these distributions mean for the design and use of networks. Given the many forms of content that have Zipf or power law distributions, it seems fundamental that Web sites on the Internet are Zipf-like in popularity. This in turn means that an average site is not a useful representation. Sites are better described as either popular or unpopular. Both kinds of sites matter. The popular sites obviously matter, since a few popular sites may be responsible for most of the traffic on the Internet. Perhaps surprisingly, the unpopular sites can matter too. This is because the total amount of traffic directed to the unpopular sites can add up to a large fraction ofthe overall traffic. The reason isthat there are somany unpopularsites. The notion that, collectively, many unpopular choices can matter has been popu- larized bybookssuchasTheLongTail(Anderson, 2008a). Curves showing decay like that of Fig. 7-64(a) are common, but they are not all the same. In particular, situations in which the rate of decay is proportional to how much material is left (such as with unstable radioactive atoms) exhibit exponential decay, which drops off much faster than Zipf’s Law. The number of items, say atoms, left after time tis usually expressed as e −t/α ,where the constant α determines how fast the decay is. The difference between exponential decay and Zipf’s Law is that with exponential decay, it is safe to ignore the end of tail but with Zipf’s Law the total weight of the tail is significant and cannot be ignored. Towork effectively inthis skewed world, we must be able to build both kinds of Web sites. Unpopular sites are easy to handle. By using DNS, many different sites may actually point to the same computer in the Internet that runs all of the sites. On the other hand, popular sites are difficult to handle. There is no single computer even remotely powerful enough, and using a single computer would make the site inaccessiblefor millionsofusers ifit fails. Tohandle these sites, we mustbuildcontent distribution systems. We willstart onthatquestnext. 7.5.2 Server Farms and Web Proxies The Web designs that we have seen so far have a single server machine talk- ing to multiple client machines', 'To build large Web sites that perform well, we can speed up processing on either the server side or the client side. On the server side, more powerful Web servers can be built with a server farm, in which a clus- ter ofcomputers acts asasingle server. Ontheclient side, better performance can SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 739 be achieved with better caching techniques. In particular, proxy caches provide a large shared cacheforagroupofclients. We will describe each of these techniques in turn. However, note that neither technique is sufficient to build the largest Web sites. Those popular sites require the content distribution methods that we describe in the following sections, which combine computers atmanydifferent locations. Server Farms No matter how much bandwidth one machine has, it can only serve so many Web requests before the load is too great. The solution in this case is to use more than onecomputer tomake a Web server. This leads tothe server farm model of Fig.7-65. Balancesload Internet acrossservers access Backend database Frontend Serverfarm Servers Clients Figure7-65. Aserverfarm. The difficulty with this seemingly simple model is that the set of computers that make up the server farm must look like a single logical Web site to clients. If theydonot,wehave justsetupdifferent Web sites thatruninparallel. There are several possible solutions to make the set of servers appear to be one Web site. All of the solutions assume that any of the servers can handle a re- quest from any client. To do this, each server must have a copy of the Web site. The servers are shown as connected to a common back-end database by a dashed lineforthispurpose. OnesolutionistouseDNStospread the requests across the servers inthe ser- ver farm. When a DNS request is made for the Web URL, the DNS server returns a rotating list of the IP addresses of the servers. Each client tries one IP address, typically the first on the list. The effect is that different clients contact different servers to access the same Web site, just as intended. The DNS method is at the heart ofCDNs,andwewillrevisit itlater inthissection. The other solutions are based on a front end that sprays incoming requests over the pool of servers in the server farm. This happens even when the client 740 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 contacts the server farm using a single destination IP address. The front end is usually a link-layer switch or an IP router, that is, a device that handles frames or packets. All of the solutions are based on it (or the servers) peeking at the net- work, transport, or application layer headers and using them in nonstandard ways. A Web request and response are carried as a TCP connection. To work correctly, thefrontendmustdistribute allofthepackets forarequest tothesame server. A simple design is for the front end to broadcast all of the incoming requests to all of the servers. Each server answers only a fraction of the requests by prior agreement. For example, 16 servers might look at the source IP address and reply tothe request onlyifthelast4bitsofthesource IPaddress match their configured selectors. Other packets are discarded', 'While this is wasteful of incoming band- width, often the responses are much longer than the request, so it is not nearly as inefficient asitsounds. In a more general design, the front end may inspect the IP, TCP, and HTTP headers of packets and arbitrarily map them to a server. The mapping is called a load balancing policy as the goal is to balance the workload across the servers. The policy may besimple orcomplex. Asimple policymightbetousetheservers one after the other in turn, or round-robin. With this approach, the front end must remember the mapping for each request sothat subsequent packets that are part of the same request willbe sent tothe same server. Also, to make the site more reli- able than a single server, the front end should notice when servers have failed and stopsendingthemrequests. Much like NAT, this general design is perilous, or at least fragile, in that we have just created a device that violates the most basic principle of layered proto- cols: each layer must use its own header for control purposes and may not inspect and use information from the payload for any purpose. But people design such systems anyway and when they break in the future due to changes in higher lay- ers, they tend to be surprised. The front end in this case is a switch or router, but it may take action based on transport layer information or higher. Such a box is called a middlebox because it interposes itself in the middle of a network path in which it has no business, according to the protocol stack. In this case, the front end is best considered an internal part of a server farm that terminates all layers up to the application layer (and hence can use all of the header information for thoselayers). Nonetheless, as with NAT, this design is useful in practice. The reason for looking at TCP headers is that it is possible to do a better job of load balancing than with IP information alone. For example, one IP address may represent an en- tire company and make many requests. It is only by looking at TCP or higher- layer information thatthese requests canbemapped todifferent servers. The reason for looking at the HTTP headers is somewhat different. Many Web interactions access and update databases, such as when a customer looks up her most recent purchase. The server that fields this request will have to query the back-end database. It is useful to direct subsequent requests from the same user to SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 741 the same server, because that server has already cached information about the user. The simplest way to cause this to happen is to use Web cookies (or other information to distinguish the user) and to inspect the HTTP headers to find the cookies. Asa final note, althoughwe have described thisdesign forWeb sites, a server farm can be built for other kinds of servers as well. An example isservers stream- ing media over UDP', 'The only change that is required is for the front end to be able to load balance these requests (which will have different protocol header fields thanWeb requests). WebProxies Web requests and responses are sent using HTTP. In Sec. 7.3, we described how browsers can cache responses and reuse them to answer future requests. Var- ious header fields and rules are used bythe browser to determine if a cached copy ofaWeb pageisstillfresh. We willnotrepeat thatmaterial here. Caching improves performance by shortening the response time and reducing the network load. If the browser can determine that a cached page is fresh by it- self, the page can be fetched from the cache immediately, with no network traffic at all. However, even if the browser must ask the server for confirmation that the page is still fresh, the response time is shortened and the network load is reduced, especially forlarge pages, since onlyasmall message needs tobesent. However, the best the browser can doistocacheall ofthe Web pages that the user has previously visited. From our discussion of popularity, you may recall that as well as a few popular pages that many people visit repeatedly, there are many, many unpopular pages. In practice, this limits the effectiveness of browser caching because there are a large number of pages that are visited just once by a givenuser. These pages always have tobefetched fromtheserver. One strategy to make caches more effective is to share the cache among mul- tiple users. That way, a page already fetched for one user can be returned to an- other user when that user makes the same request. Without browser caching, both users wouldneed tofetch the page fromthe server. Of course, this sharing cannot be done for encrypted traffic, pages that require authentication, and uncacheable pages (e.g., current stock prices) that are returned by programs. Dynamic pages created by programs, especially, are a growing case for which caching is not ef- fective. Nonetheless, there are plenty of Web pages that are visible tomany users andlookthesame nomatter which usermakes therequest (e.g., images). A Web proxy is used to share a cache among users. A proxy is an agent that acts onbehalf of someone else, such as the user. There are many kinds ofproxies. For instance, an ARP proxy replies to ARP requests on behalf of a user who is elsewhere (and cannot reply for himself). A Web proxy fetches Web requests on behalf of its users. It normally provides caching of the Web responses, and since itisshared across usersithasasubstantially larger cachethanabrowser. 742 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 When a proxy is used, the typical setup is for an organization to operate one Web proxy for all of its users. The organization might be a company or an ISP. Both stand to benefit by speeding up Web requests for its users and reducing its bandwidth needs. While flat pricing, independent of usage, is common for end users, most companies and ISPs are charged according to the bandwidth that they use. This setup is shown in Fig. 7-66', 'To use the proxy, each browser is configu- red to make page requests to the proxy instead of to the page’s real server. If the proxy has the page, it returns the page immediately. If not, it fetches the page from the server, adds it to the cache for future use, and returns it to the client that requested it. Browsercache Organization Internet Proxycache Servers Clients Figure7-66. AproxycachebetweenWebbrowsersandWebservers. As well as sending Web requests to the proxy instead of the real server, cli- ents perform their own caching using its browser cache. The proxy is only con- sulted after thebrowser hastried tosatisfy therequest fromits owncache.That is, theproxyprovides asecondlevel ofcaching. Further proxies may be added to provide additional levels of caching. Each proxy (or browser) makes requests via its upstream proxy. Each upstream proxy caches for the downstream proxies (or browsers). Thus, it is possible for brow- sers in a company to use a company proxy, which uses an ISP proxy, which con- tacts Web servers directly. However, the single level of proxy caching we have shown in Fig.7-66 is often sufficient to gain most of the potential benefits, in practice. The problem again is the long tail of popularity. Studies of Web traffic have shown that shared caching is especially beneficial until the number of users reaches about the size of a small company (say, 100 people). As the number of people grows larger, the benefits of sharing a cache become marginal because of the unpopular requests that cannot be cached due to lack of storage space (Wol- manetal., 1999). Web proxies provide additional benefits that are often a factor in the decision to deploy them. One benefit is to filter content. The administrator may configure SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 743 the proxy to blacklist sites or otherwise filter the requests that it makes. For ex- ample, many administrators frown on employees watching YouTube videos (or worse yet, pornography) on company time and set their filters accordingly. An- other benefit of having proxies is privacy or anonymity, when the proxy shields theidentityoftheuserfromtheserver. 7.5.3 Content Delivery Networks Server farms and Web proxies help to build large sites and to improve Web performance, but they are not sufficient for truly popular Web sites that must serve content onaglobalscale. Forthese sites, adifferent approach isneeded. CDNs(Content Delivery Networks)turnthe idea oftraditionalWeb caching on its head. Instead, of having clients look for a copy of the requested page in a nearby cache, it is the provider who places a copy of the page in a set of nodes at different locations anddirects theclient touseanearby nodeastheserver. An example of the path that data follows when it is distributed by a CDN is showninFig. 7-67. Itisatree. The origin server inthe CDN distributes a copyof the content toother nodesinthe CDN, inSydney, Boston, and Amsterdam, inthis example. This is shown with dashed lines. Clients then fetch pages from the nearest node in the CDN. This is shown with solid lines. In this way, the clients inSydneybothfetch thepage copythatisstoredinSydney;theydonotbothfetch thepage fromtheoriginserver, which maybeinEurope', 'CDNorigin server Distributionto CDNnodes CDNnode Sydney Boston Amsterdam Page fetch Worldwideclients Figure7-67. CDNdistributiontree. Using a tree structure has three virtues. First, the content distribution can be scaled uptoas manyclients asneeded byusingmorenodesintheCDN, andmore levels in the tree when the distribution among CDN nodes becomes the bottleneck. No matter how many clients there are, the tree structure is efficient. The originserver isnotoverloaded becauseit talks tothe many clients via the tree 744 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 of CDN nodes; it does not have to answer each request for a page by itself. Sec- ond,eachclient gets goodperformance byfetching pages from anearby server in- stead of a distant server. This is because the round-trip time for setting up a con- nection is shorter, TCP slow-start ramps up more quickly because of the shorter round-trip time, and the shorter network path is less likely topass through regions of congestion in the Internet. Finally, the total load that is placed on the network is also kept at a minimum. If the CDN nodes are well placed, the traffic for a given page shouldpass over each part of the network only once. This is important becausesomeone paysfornetwork bandwidth, eventually. The idea of using a distribution tree is straightforward. What is less simple is how to organize the clients to use this tree. For example, proxy servers would seem to provide a solution. Looking at Fig. 7-67, if each client was configured to use the Sydney, Boston or Amsterdam CDN node as a caching Web proxy, the distribution would follow the tree. However, this strategy falls short in practice, for three reasons. The first reason is that the clients in a given part of the network probably belong to different organizations, so they are probably using different Web proxies. Recall that caches are not usually shared across organizations be- cause of the limited benefit of caching over a large number of clients, and for se- curity reasons too. Second, there can be multiple CDNs, but each client uses only a single proxy cache. Which CDN should a client use as its proxy? Finally, per- haps the most practical issue of all is that Web proxies are configured by clients. They may or may not be configured to benefit content distribution by a CDN, and there islittlethat theCDNcan doaboutit. Another simple way tosupportadistribution tree withone level is touse mir- roring. In this approach, the origin server replicates content over the CDN nodes as before. The CDN nodes in different network regions are called mirrors. The Web pages on the origin server contain explicit links to the different mirrors, usually telling the user their location. This design lets the user manually select a nearby mirror to use for downloading content. A typical use of mirroring is to place a large software package on mirrors located in, for example, the East and West coasts of the U.S., Asia, and Europe. Mirrored sites are generally com- pletely static, andthe choice ofsites remains stable for months or years. They are a tried and tested technique', 'However, they depend on the user to do the distribu- tionasthemirrorsare really different Web sites, even iftheyare linkedtogether. The third approach, which overcomes the difficulties of the previous two ap- proaches, uses DNS and is called DNS redirection. Suppose that a client wants to fetch a page with the URL http://www.cdn.com/page.html. To fetch the page, the browser will use DNS to resolve www.cdn.com to an IP address. This DNS lookup proceeds in the usual manner. By using the DNS protocol, the browser learns the IP address of the name server for cdn.com, then contacts the name server to ask it to resolve www.cdn.com. Now comes the really clever bit. The name server isrunbytheCDN. Instead, ofreturning thesame IPaddress foreach request, it will look at the IP address of the client making the request and return SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 745 different answers. The answer will be the IP address of the CDN node that is nearest the client. That is, if a client in Sydney asks the CDN name server to resolve www.cdn.com, the name server will return the IP address of the Sydney CDN node, but if a client in Amsterdam makes the same request, the name server willreturntheIPaddress oftheAmsterdam CDNnodeinstead. This strategy is perfectly legal according to the semantics of DNS. We have previously seen that name servers may return changing lists of IP addresses. After the name resolution, the Sydney client will fetch the page directly from the Syd- ney CDN node. Further pages onthe same ‘‘server’’ willbe fetched directly from the Sydney CDN node as well because of DNS caching. The overall sequence of stepsisshowninFig. 7-68.

DirectingclientstonearbyCDNnodesusingDNS. A complex question in the above process is what it means to find the nearest CDN node, and how to go about it. To define nearest, it is not really geography that matters. There are at least two factors to consider in mapping a client to a CDN node.One factor isthe network distance. Theclient shouldhave ashortand high-capacity network path to the CDN node. This situation will produce quick downloads. CDNs use a map they have previously computed to translate between the IP address of a client and its network location. The CDN node that is selected might be the one at the shortest distance as the crow flies, or it might not. What matters is some combination of the length of the network path and any capacity limits along it. The second factor is the load that is already being carried by the CDN node. If the CDN nodes are overloaded, they will deliver slow responses, just like the overloaded Web server that we sought to avoid in the first place. Thus, it may be necessary to balance the load across the CDN nodes, mapping someclients tonodesthatare slightlyfurther away butmorelightly loaded. The techniques for using DNS for content distribution were pioneered by Akamai starting in 1998, when the Web was groaning under the load of its early 746 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 growth', 'Akamai was the first major CDN and became the industry leader. Proba- bly even more clever than the idea of using DNS to connect clients to nearby nodes was the incentive structure of their business. Companies pay Akamai to de- liver their content toclients, sothattheyhave responsiveWeb sitesthatcustomers like to use. The CDN nodes must be placed at network locations with good con- nectivity, which initiallymeant inside ISP networks. For the ISPs, there is a bene- fit to having a CDN node in their networks, namely that the CDN node cuts down the amount of upstream network bandwidth that they need (and mustpayfor), just as with proxycaches. In addition,the CDN node improves responsiveness for the ISP’s customers, which makes the ISP look good in their eyes, giving them a competitiveadvantage over ISPs that donothave aCDN node. These benefits (at no cost to the ISP) makes installing a CDN node a no brainer for the ISP. Thus, the content provider, the ISP, and the customers all benefit and the CDN makes money. Since 1998, other companies have gotten into the business, so it is now a competitiveindustrywithmultipleproviders. As this description implies, most companies do not build their own CDN. In- stead, they use the services of a CDN provider such as Akamai to actually deliver their content. To let other companies use the service of a CDN, we need to add onelast steptoourpicture. After the contract is signed for a CDN to distribute content on behalf of a Web site owner, the owner gives the CDN the content. This content is pushed to the CDN nodes. In addition, the owner rewrites any of its Web pages that link to the content. Instead of linking to the content on their Web site, the pages link to the content via the CDN. As an example of how this scheme works, consider the source code for Fluffy Video’s Web page, given in Fig. 7-69(a). After preproc- essing, it is transformed to Fig.7-69(b) and placed on Fluffy Video’s server as www.fluffyvideo.com/index.html. When a user types in the URL www.fluffyvideo.com to his browser, DNS re- turns the IP address of Fluffy Video’s own Web site, allowing the main (HTML) page to be fetched in the normal way. When the user clicks on any of the hyper- links, the browser asks DNS to look up www.cdn.com. This lookup contacts the CDN’s DNS server, which returns the IP address of the nearby CDN node. The browser then sends a regular HTTP request to the CDN node, for example, for /fluffyvideo/koalas.mpg. The URL identifies the page to return, starting the path with fluffyvideo so that the CDN node can separate requests for the different com- panies that it serves. Finally, the video is returned and the user sees cute fluffy animals. The strategy behind this split of content hosted by the CDN and entry pages hosted bythe content owner isthat itgives the content owner control while letting the CDN move the bulk of the data. Most entry pages are tiny, being just HTML text', 'These pages often link to large files, such as videos and images. It is pre- cisely these large files that are served by the CDN, even though the use of a CDN iscompletely transparent tousers. The site looksthesame, butperforms faster.

(a)OriginalWebpage.(b)SamepageafterlinkingtotheCDN. There is another advantage for sites using a shared CDN. The future demand for a Web site can be difficult to predict. Frequently, there are surges in demand known as flash crowds. Such a surge may happen when the latest product is re- leased, there is a fashion show or other event, or the company is otherwise in the news. Even a Web site that was a previously unknown, unvisited backwater can suddenly become the focus of the Internet if it is newsworthy and linked from popular sites. Since most sites are not prepared to handle massive increases in traffic, theresult isthatmanyofthemcrash whentraffic surges. Case inpoint.Normally theFlorida Secretary ofState’s Web site isnotabusy place, although you can look up information about Florida corporations, notaries, and cultural affairs, as well as information about voting and elections there. For some odd reason, on Nov. 7, 2000 (the date of the U.S. presidential election with Bush vs. Gore), a whole lot of people were suddenly interested in the election re- sults page of this site. The site suddenly became one of the busiest Web sites in the world and naturally crashed as a result. If it had been using a CDN, it would probably havesurvived. By using a CDN, a site has access to a very large content-serving capacity. The largest CDNs have tens of thousands of servers deployed incountriesall over the world. Since only a small number of sites will be experiencing a flash crowd 748 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 at any one time (by definition), those sites may use the CDN’s capacity to handle the load until the storm passes. That is, the CDN can quickly scale up a site’s servingcapacity. The preceding discussion above is a simplified description of how Akamai works. There are many more details that matter in practice. The CDN nodes pic- tured in our example are normally clusters of machines. DNS redirection is done with two levels: one to map clients to the approximate network location, and an- other to spread the load over nodes in that location. Both reliability and perfor- mance are concerns. To be able to shift a client from one machine in a cluster to another, DNS replies at the second level are given with short TTLs so that the cli- ent will repeat the resolution after a short while. Finally, while we have concen- trated ondistributing static objects like images andvideos, CDNs can also support dynamic page creation, streaming media, and more. For more information about CDNs, see Dilleyetal. (2002). 7.5.4 Peer-to-Peer Networks Not everyone can set up a 1000-node CDN at locations around the world to distribute their content', '(Actually, it is not hard to rent 1000 virtual machines around the globe because of the well-developed and competitive hosting industry. However, setting up a CDN only starts with getting the nodes.) Luckily, there is an alternative for the rest of us that is simple to use and can distribute a tremen- dousamountofcontent. ItisaP2P(Peer-to-Peer) network. P2P networks burst onto the scene starting in 1999. The first widespread ap- plication was for mass crime: 50 million Napster users were exchanging copy- righted songs without the copyright owners’ permission until Napster was shut down by the courts amid great controversy. Nevertheless, peer-to-peer technolo- gy has many interesting and legal uses. Other systems continued development, with such great interest from users that P2P traffic quickly eclipsed Web traffic. Today, BitTorrent is the most popular P2P protocol. It is used so widely to share (licensed and public domain) videos, as well as other content, that it accounts for alarge fraction ofallInternet traffic. Wewilllookatitinthissection. The basic idea of a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) file-sharing network is that many computers come together and pool their resources to form a content distribution system. The computers are often simply home computers. They do not need to be machines in Internet data centers. The computers are called peers because each one can alternately act as a client to another peer, fetching its content, and as a server, providing content to other peers. What makes peer-to-peer systems inter- esting is that there is no dedicated infrastructure, unlike in a CDN. Everyone par- ticipates in the task of distributing content, and there is often no central point of control. Many people are excited about P2P technology because it is seen as empow- ering the little guy. The reason is not only that it takes a large company to run a SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 749 CDN, while anyone with a computer can join a P2P network. It is that P2P net- works have a formidable capacity to distribute content that can match the largest ofWeb sites. Consider a P2P network made up of N average users, each with broadband connectivityat 1Mbps. The aggregate upload capacity oftheP2Pnetwork, orrate at which the users can send traffic into the Internet, is N Mbps. The download capacity, or rate at which the users can receive traffic, is also N Mbps. Each user can upload and download at the same time, too, because they have a 1-Mbps link ineachdirection. Itisnotobviousthat thisshouldbe true, butitturnsoutthat all ofthe capacity can be used productively to distribute content, even for the case of sharing a sin- gle copy of a file with all the other users. To see how this can be so, imagine that the users are organized into a binary tree, with each non-leaf user sending to two other users. The tree willcarry thesingle copyofthe file toall the other users. To use the upload bandwidth of as many users as possible at all times (and hence dis- tribute the large file with low latency), we need topipeline the network activity of the users. Imagine that the file is divided into 1000pieces', 'Each user can receive a new piece from somewhere up the tree and send the previously received piece down the tree at the same time. This way, once the pipeline is started, after a small number of pieces (equal to the depth of the tree) are sent, all non-leaf users will be busy uploading the file to other users. Since there are approximately N/2 non-leaf users, the upload bandwidth of this tree is N/2Mbps. We can repeat this trick and create another tree that uses the other N/2Mbpsof upload bandwidth by swapping the roles ofleaf andnon-leafnodes. Together, this construction uses all ofthecapacity. This argument means that P2P networks are self-scaling. Their usable upload capacity grows in tandem with the download demands that can be made by their users. They are always ‘‘large enough’’ in some sense, without the need for any dedicated infrastructure. Incontrast, thecapacity ofeven alarge Website isfixed and will either be too large or too small. Consider a site with only 100 clusters, each capable of 10 Gbps. This enormous capacity does not help when there are a small number of users. The site cannot get information to N users at a rate faster than N Mbps because the limit is at the users and not the Web site. And when there are more than one million 1-Mbps users, the Web site cannot pump out data fast enough to keep all the users busy downloading. That may seem like a large number of users, but large BitTorrent networks (e.g., Pirate Bay) claim to have more than 10,000,000 users. That is more like 10 terabits/sec in terms of our ex- ample! You should take these back-of-the-envelope numbers with a grain (or better yet, a metric ton) of salt because they oversimplify the situation. A significant challenge for P2P networks is to use bandwidth well when users can come in all shapes and sizes, and have different download and upload capacities. Neverthe- less, these numbersdoindicate theenormous potential ofP2P. 750 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 There is another reason that P2P networks are important. CDNs and other centrally run services put the providers in a position of having a trove of personal information about many users, from browsing preferences and where people shop online, topeople’s locations and email addresses. Thisinformation can beusedto provide better, more personalized service, or it can be used to intrude on people’s privacy. The latter may happen either intentionally—say as part of a new prod- uct—or throughanaccidentaldisclosure orcompromise. With P2P systems, there can be no single provider that is capable of monitoring the entire system. This does not mean that P2P systems will necessarily provide privacy, as users are trusting each other to some extent. It only means that they can provide a different form of privacy than centrally managed systems. P2P systems are now being explored for services beyond file sharing (e.g., storage, streaming), and time will tell whether thisadvantage issignificant. P2P technology has followed two related paths as it has been developed. On the more practical side, there are the systems that are used every day', 'The most well known of these systems are based on the BitTorrent protocol. On the more academic side, there has been intense interest in DHT (Distributed Hash Table) algorithms that let P2P systems perform well as a whole, yet rely on no cent- ralized componentsatall. We willlookatbothofthese technologies. BitTorrent The BitTorrent protocol was developed by Brahm Cohen in 2001 to let a set of peers share files quickly and easily. There are dozens of freely available cli- ents that speak this protocol, just as there are many browsers that speak the HTTP protocol to Web servers. The protocol is available as an open standard at www.bittorrent.org. In a typical peer-to-peer system, like that formed with BitTorrent, the users each have some information that may be of interest to other users. This infor- mation may be free software, music, videos, photographs, and so on. There are three problems thatneedtobesolvedtoshare content inthissetting: 1. How does a peer find other peers that have the content it wants to download? 2. How is content replicated by peers to provide high-speed downloads foreveryone? 3. How do peers encourage each other to upload content to others as well asdownloadcontent forthemselves? The first problem exists because not all peers will have all of the content, at least initially. The approach taken in BitTorrent is for every content provider to create acontent description called a torrent. The torrent ismuch smaller than the SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 751 content, and is used by a peer to verify the integrity of the data that it downloads from other peers. Other users who want todownload the content must first obtain thetorrent, say,byfindingitonaWebpage advertising thecontent. The torrent is just a file in a specified format that contains two key kinds of information. One kind is the name of a tracker, which is a server that leads peers to the content of the torrent. The other kind of information is a list of equal-sized pieces, or chunks,that make upthe content. Different chunksizes can be used for different torrents, typically 64KB to 512KB. The torrent file contains the name of each chunk, given as a 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the chunk. We will cover cryptographic hashes such as SHA-1 in Chap. 8. For now, you can think of a hash as a longer and more secure checksum. Given the size of chunks and hashes, the torrent file is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the content, so it can betransferred quickly. To download the content described in a torrent, a peer first contacts the tracker for the torrent. The tracker is a server that maintains a list of all the other peers that are actively downloading and uploading the content. This set of peers is called a swarm. The members of the swarm contact the tracker regularly to report that they are still active, as well as when they leave the swarm. When a new peer contacts the tracker to join the swarm, the tracker tells it about other peers inthe swarm', 'Gettingthe torrent and contacting the tracker are the first two stepsfordownloading content, asshowninFig.7-70. 1:Gettorrent metafile Unchoked peers Torrent 3:Tradechunks withpeers 2:Getpeers Peer fromtracker Sourceof content Tracker Seed peer Figure7-70. BitTorrent. The second problem is how to share content in a way that gives rapid down- loads. When a swarm is first formed, some peers must have all of the chunks that make up the content. These peers are called seeders. Other peers that join the swarm willhave nochunks;theyare thepeers thatare downloading thecontent. While apeer participates inaswarm, it simultaneously downloads chunksthat it is missing from other peers, and uploads chunks that it has to other peers who 752 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 need them. This trading is shown as the last step of content distribution in Fig.7- 70. Over time, the peer gathers more chunks until it has downloaded all of the content. The peer can leave the swarm (and return) at any time. Normally a peer will stay for a short period after finishes its own download. With peers coming andgoing,therate ofchurninaswarm canbequitehigh. For the above method to work well, each chunk should be available at many peers. If everyone were to get the chunks in the same order, it is likely that many peers would depend on the seeders for the next chunk. This would create a bottleneck. Instead, peers exchange lists of the chunks they have with each other. Then they select rare chunks that are hard to find to download. The idea is that downloading a rare chunkwillmake a copyofit, which willmake the chunkeasi- er for other peers to find and download. If all peers do this, after a short while all chunkswillbewidely available. The third problem is perhaps the most interesting. CDN nodes are set up exclusively to provide content to users. P2P nodes are not. They are users’ com- puters, and the users may be more interested in gettinga movie than helping other users with their downloads. Nodes that take resources fromasystemwithoutcon- tributinginkindare called free-ridersorleechers. Ifthere are toomany ofthem, the system will not function well. Earlier P2P systems were known to host them (Saroiu etal., 2003)soBitTorrent soughttominimize them. The approach taken in BitTorrent clients is to reward peers who show good upload behavior. Each peer randomly samples the other peers, retrieving chunks from them while it uploads chunks to them. The peer continues to trade chunks withonlyasmall numberofpeers thatprovide thehighest downloadperformance, while also randomly trying other peers to find good partners. Randomly trying peers also allows newcomers toobtaininitialchunksthattheycan trade withother peers. The peers with which a node is currently exchanging chunks are said to be unchoked. Over time, this algorithm is intended to match peers with comparable upload and download rates with each other. The more a peer is contributing to the other peers, the more it can expect inreturn. Usinga set ofpeers also helps to saturate a peer’s download bandwidth for high performance. Conversely, if a peer is not uploading chunks to other peers, or is doing so very slowly, it will be cut off, or choked, sooner or later', 'This strategy discourages antisocial behavior in which peers free-ride ontheswarm. The chokingalgorithm issometimes described as implementing the tit-for-tat strategy that encourages cooperation in repeated interactions. However, it does not prevent clients from gaming the system in any strong sense (Piatek et al., 2007). Nonetheless, attention to the issue and mechanisms that make it more dif- ficult for casual users to free-ride have likely contributed to the success of Bit- Torrent. As youcan see from our discussion, BitTorrent comes with a rich vocabulary. There are torrents, swarms, leechers, seeders, and trackers, as well as snubbing, SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 753 choking, lurking, and more. For more information see the short paper on Bit- Torrent (Cohen, 2003)andlookontheWeb starting withwww.bittorrent.org. DHTs—Distributed HashTables The emergence ofP2P file sharing networks around 2000sparked much inter- est in the research community. The essence of P2P systems is that they avoid the centrally managed structures ofCDNsandother systems. Thiscan bea significant advantage. Centrally managed components become a bottleneck as the system grows very large and are a single point of failure. Central components can also be used as a point of control (e.g., to shut off the P2P network). However, the early P2P systems were only partly decentralized, or, if they were fully decentralized, theywere inefficient. The traditional form of BitTorrent that we just described uses peer-to-peer transfers and a centralized tracker for each swarm. It is the tracker that turns out to be the hard part to decentralize in a peer-to-peer system. The key problem is how to find out which peers have specific content that is being sought. For ex- ample, each user might have one or more data items such as songs, photographs, programs, files, and so on that other users might want to read. How do the other users find them? Making one index of who has what is simple, but it is cent- ralized. Having every peer keep its own index does not help. True, it is distrib- uted. However, it requires so much work to keep the indexes of all peers up to date (ascontent ismovedaboutthesystem) thatitisnotworththeeffort. The question tackled by the research community was whether it was possible to build P2P indexes that were entirely distributed but performed well. By per- form well, we mean three things. First, each node keeps only a small amount of information about other nodes. This property means that it will not be expensive to keep the index up to date. Second, each node can look up entries in the index quickly. Otherwise, it is not a very useful index. Third, each node can use the index at the same time, even as other nodes come and go. This property means theperformance oftheindexgrowswiththenumber ofnodes. The answer is to the question was: ‘‘Yes.’’ Four different solutions were in- vented in 2001. They are Chord (Stoica et al., 2001), CAN (Ratnasamy et al., 2001), Pastry (Rowstron and Druschel, 2001), and Tapestry (Zhao et al., 2004)', 'Other solutions were invented soonafterwards, including Kademlia, whichisused inpractice (MaymounkovandMazieres, 2002).Thesolutionsare knownas DHTs (Distributed Hash Tables) because the basic functionality of an index is to map a key to a value. This is like a hash table, and the solutions are distributed ver- sions,ofcourse. DHTs do their work by imposing a regular structure on the communication between the nodes, as we will see. This behavior is quite different than that of traditional P2P networks that use whatever connections peers happen to make. 754 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 For thisreason, DHTs are called structured P2P networks. TraditionalP2P pro- tocols buildunstructured P2Pnetworks. The DHT solution that we will describe is Chord. As a scenario, consider how to replace the centralized tracker traditionally used in BitTorrent with a fully-distributed tracker. Chord can be used to solve this problem. In this scenario, the overall index is a listing of all of the swarms that a computer may join todownload content. The key used to look upthe index is the torrent descrip- tion of the content. It uniquely identifies a swarm from which content can be downloaded as the hashes of all the content chunks. The value stored in the index for each key is the list ofpeers that comprise the swarm. These peers are the com- puters to contact to download the content. A person wanting to download content such as a movie has only the torrent description. The question the DHT must answer is how, lacking a central database, does a person find outwhich peers (out ofthemillionsofBitTorrent nodes)todownload themoviefrom? A Chord DHT consists of n participating nodes. They are nodes running Bit- Torrent in our scenario. Each node has an IP address by which it may be con- tacted. The overall index is spread across the nodes. This implies that each node stores bits and pieces of the index for use by other nodes. The key part of Chord is that it navigates the index using identifiers in a virtual space, not the IP ad- dresses of nodes or the names of content like movies. Conceptually, the identi- fiers are simplym-bitnumbers thatcanbearranged inascending orderintoaring. To turn a node address into an identifier, it is mapped to an m-bit number using a hash function, hash. Chord uses SHA-1 for hash. This is the same hash that we mentioned when describing BitTorrent. We will look at it when we dis- cuss cryptography in Chap. 8. For now, suffice it to say that it is just a function that takes a variable-length byte string as an argument and produces a highly ran- dom 160-bit number. Thus, we can use it to convert any IP address to a 160-bit number called thenode identifier. In Fig.7-71(a), we show the node identifier circle for m =5. (Just ignore the arcs in the middle for the moment.) Some of the identifiers correspond to nodes, butmostdonot. Inthisexample, the nodeswith identifiers 1,4,7,12,15,20,and 27correspondtoactual nodesandare shaded inthefigure; therestdonotexist. Let us now define the function successor(k) as the node identifier of the first actual node following k around the circle, clockwise. For example, succes- sor(6)=7,successor(8)=12,andsuccessor(22)=27', \"A key is also produced by hashing a content name with hash (i.e., SHA-1) to generate a160-bitnumber. Inourscenario, the content name isthe torrent. Thus, in order to convert torrent (the torrent description file) to its key, we compute key =hash(torrent). Thiscomputation isjustalocal procedure call tohash. Tostart anewaswarm, anodeneeds toinsert anewkey-value pair consisting of (torrent, my-IP-address) into the index. To accomplish this, the node asks successor(hash(torrent))tostore my-IP-address. In this way, the index is distrib- uted over the nodes at random.

(b)Examples ofthefinger tables. could be used to store the data at p nodes, but we will not consider the subject of fault tolerance further here. Some time after the DHT is constructed, another node wants to find a torrent so that it can join the swarm and download content. A node looks up torrent by first hashing it to get key, and second using successor(key) to find the IP address of the node storing the corresponding value. The value is the list of peers in the swarm; the node can add its IP address to the list and contact the other peers to downloadcontent withtheBitTorrent protocol. The first step is easy; the second one is not easy. To make it possible to find the IP address of the node correspondingto a certain key, each node is required to 756 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 maintain certain administrative data structures. One of these is the IP address of its successor node along the node identifier circle. For example, in Fig.7-71, node4’ssuccessoris7andnode7’ssuccessoris12. Lookup can now proceed as follows. The requesting node sends a packet to its successor containing its IP address and the key it is looking for. The packet is propagated around the ring until it locates the successor to the node identifier being sought. That node checks to see if it has any information matching the key, andifso,returns itdirectly totherequesting node,whoseIPaddress ithas. However, linearly searching all the nodes is very inefficient in a large peer- to-peer system since the mean number of nodes required per search is n/2. To greatly speed up the search, each node also maintains what Chord calls a finger table\", 'The finger table hasmentries, indexed by0throughm −1,eachonepoint- ing to a different actual node. Each of the entries has two fields: start and the IP address of successor(start), as shown for three example nodes in Fig. 7-71(b). The values ofthefields forentry iatanodewithidentifier kare: start =k +2i (modulo 2m) IPaddress ofsuccessor(start[i]) Note that each node stores the IP addresses of a relatively small number of nodes andthatmostofthese are fairly close byinterms ofnodeidentifier. Using the finger table, the lookupof key at node k proceeds as follows. If key falls between k and successor(k), the node holding information about key is successor(k) and the search terminates. Otherwise, the finger table is searched to find the entry whose start field isthe closest predecessorofkey. Arequest isthen sent directly to the IP address in that finger table entry to ask it to continue the search. Since it is closer to key but still below it, chances are good that it will be able to return the answer with only a small number of additional queries. In fact, since every lookup halves the remaining distance to the target, it can be shown thattheaverage number oflookupsislog n. 2 As a first example, consider looking up key =3 at node 1. Since node 1 knows that 3 lies between it and its successor, 4, the desired node is 4 and the search terminates, returning node4’sIPaddress. As a second example, consider looking up key =16 at node 1. Since 16 does not lie between 1 and 4, the finger table is consulted. The closest predecessor to 16 is 9, so the request is forwarded to the IP address of 9’s entry, namely, that of node 12. Node 12 also does not know the answer itself, so it looks for the node most closely preceding 16 and finds 14, which yields the IP address of node 15. A query is then sent there. Node 15 observes that 16 lies between it and its suc- cessor (20), so it returns the IP address of 20 to the caller, which works its way back tonode1. Since nodesjoinandleave allthetime, Chordneeds awaytohandle these op- erations. We assume that when the system began operation it was small enough that the nodescould justexchange information directly to build the first circle and SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 757 finger tables. After that, an automated procedure is needed. When a new node, r, wants to join, it must contact some existing node and ask it to look up the IP address of successor(r) for it. Next, the new node then asks successor(r) for its predecessor. The new node then asks both of these to insert r in between them in the circle. For example, if 24 in Fig.7-71 wants to join, it asks any node to look up successor(24), which is 27. Then it asks 27 for its predecessor (20). After it tells both of those about its existence, 20 uses 24 as its successor and 27 uses 24 as its predecessor. In addition,node 27hands over those keys in the range 21–24, whichnowbelongto24. Atthispoint,24isfullyinserted. However, many finger tables are now wrong', 'To correct them, every node runs a background process that periodically recomputes each finger by calling successor. When one of these queries hits a new node, the corresponding finger entry isupdated. When a node leaves gracefully, it hands its keys over to its successor and informs its predecessor of its departure so the predecessor can link to the depart- ing node’s successor. When a node crashes, a problem arises because its prede- cessor nolongerhasavalidsuccessor. Toalleviate thisproblem, eachnodekeeps track not only of its direct successor but also its s direct successors, to allow it to skip over up to s −1 consecutive failed nodes and reconnect the circle if disaster strikes. There hasbeen atremendousamountofresearch onDHTs since they were in- vented. To give you an idea of just how much research, let us pose a question: what is the most-cited networking paper of all time? You will find it difficult to come up with a paper that is cited more than the seminal Chord paper (Stoica et al., 2001). Despite this veritable mountain of research, applications of DHTs are only slowly beginning to emerge. Some BitTorrent clients use DHTs to provide a fully distributed tracker of the kind that we described. Large commercial cloud services such as Amazon’s Dynamo also incorporate DHT techniques (DeCandia etal., 2007). 7.6 SUMMARY Naming inthe ARPANET started outinavery simple way: anASCII text file listed the names of all the hosts and their corresponding IP addresses. Every night all the machines downloaded thisfile. Butwhen the ARPANET morphed into the Internet and exploded in size, a far more sophisticated and dynamic naming scheme was required. The one used now is a hierarchical scheme called the Do- main Name System. It organizes all the machines on the Internet into a set of trees. At the top level are the well-known generic domains, including com and edu, as well as about 200 country domains. DNS is implemented as a distributed database with servers all over the world. By querying a DNS server, a process 758 THEAPPLICATION LAYER CHAP. 7 can map an Internet domain name ontothe IP address used tocommunicate witha computer forthatdomain. Email isthe original killerapp ofthe Internet. Itisstillwidely used byevery- one from small children to grandparents. Most email systems inthe world use the mail system now defined in RFCs 5321 and 5322. Messages have simple ASCII headers, and many kindsofcontent canbesentusingMIME. Mailissubmittedto message transfer agents fordelivery and retrieved from them for presentation bya variety of user agents, including Web applications. Submitted mail is delivered using SMTP, which works by making a TCP connection from the sending mes- sage transfer agent tothereceivingone. The Web is the application that most people think of as being the Internet. Originally, it was a system for seamlessly linking hypertext pages (written in HTML) across machines. The pages are downloaded by making a TCP con- nection from the browser to a server and using HTTP. Nowadays, much of the content on the Web is produced dynamically, either at the server (e.g., with PHP) or in the browser (e.g., with JavaScript)', 'When combined with back-end data- bases, dynamic server pages allow Web applications such as e-commerce and search. Dynamic browser pages are evolving into full-featured applications, such as email, that run inside the browser and use the Web protocols to communicate withremote servers. Caching and persistent connections are widely used to enhance Web per- formance. Using the Web on mobile devices can be challenging, despite the growth in the bandwidth and processing power of mobiles. Web sites often send tailored versions of pages with smaller images and less complex navigation to de- vices withsmall displays. The Web protocols are increasingly being used for machine-to-machine com- munication. XML ispreferred toHTML asadescription ofcontent thatiseasy for machines to process. SOAP is an RPC mechanism that sends XML messages usingHTTP. Digital audio andvideo have been keydrivers for the Internet since 2000.The majority of Internet traffic today is video. Much of it is streamed from Web sites overamixofprotocols (including RTP/UDP andRTP/HTTP/TCP). Live media is streamed to many consumers. It includes Internet radio and TV stations that broadcast all manner of events. Audio and video are also used for real-time con- ferencing. Many calls use voice over IP, rather than the traditional telephone net- work,andinclude videoconferencing. There are a small number of tremendously popular Web sites, as well as a very large number of less popularones. Toserve the popularsites, content distrib- ution networks have been deployed. CDNs use DNS to direct clients to a nearby server; the servers are placed in data centers all around the world. Alternatively, P2P networks let a collection of machines share content such as movies among themselves. They provide a content distribution capacity that scales withthe num- berofmachines intheP2Pnetwork andwhich canrival thelargest ofsites. CHAP.7 PROBLEMS 759 PROBLEMS 1.

Under these conditions, security did not get a lot of attention. But now, as millions of ordinary citizens are using networks for banking, shop- ping, and filing their tax returns, and weakness after weakness has been found, network security has become a problem of massive proportions. In this chapter, we will study network security from several angles, point out numerous pitfalls, anddiscuss manyalgorithms andprotocols formakingnetworks moresecure. Security is a broad topic and covers a multitude of sins. In its simplest form, it is concerned with making sure that nosy people cannot read, or worse yet, secretly modify messages intended for other recipients. It is concerned with peo- ple trying to access remote services that they are not authorized to use. It also deals with ways to tell whether that message purportedly from the IRS ‘‘Pay by Friday, or else’’ is really from the IRS and not from the Mafia. Security also deals with the problems of legitimate messages being captured and replayed, and withpeople later tryingtodenythattheysent certain messages. Most security problems are intentionally caused by malicious people trying to gain some benefit, get attention, or harm someone', 'A few of the most common perpetrators are listed in Fig.8-1. It should be clear from this list that making a network secure involves a lot more than just keeping it free of programming er- rors. It involves outsmarting often intelligent, dedicated, and sometimes well- funded adversaries. It should also be clear that measures that will thwart casual 763 764 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 attackers will have little impact on the serious ones. Police records show that the most damaging attacks are not perpetrated by outsiders tapping a phone line but byinsiders bearing agrudge. Security systems shouldbedesigned accordingly.

Somepeoplewhomaycausesecurityproblems,andwhy. Network security problems can be divided roughly into four closely intertwined areas: secrecy, authentication, nonrepudiation, and integrity control. Secrecy, also called confidentiality, has to do with keeping information out of the grubby little hands of unauthorized users. This is what usually comes to mind when people think aboutnetwork security. Authentication deals with determining whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information or entering into a business deal. Nonrepudiation deals with signatures: how do you prove that your customer really placed an electronic order for ten million left-handed doohickeys at89cents eachwhenhelater claims theprice was 69cents? Ormaybe he claims he never placed any order. Finally, integrity control has to do with how you can be sure that a message you received was really the one sent and not something thatamalicious adversary modified intransit orconcocted. All these issues (secrecy, authentication, nonrepudiation, and integrity con- trol) occur in traditional systems, too, but with some significant differences. In- tegrity and secrecy are achieved by using registered mail and locking documents up. Robbingthemailtrain isharder nowthanitwas inJesse James’ day. Also, people can usually tell the difference between an original paper docu- ment and a photocopy, and it often matters to them. As a test, make a photocopy of a valid check. Try cashing the original check at your bank on Monday. Now try cashing the photocopy of the check on Tuesday. Observe the difference in the bank’s behavior. With electronic checks, the original and the copy are indistin- guishable. Itmaytake awhile forbankstolearn howtohandle this. People authenticate other people by various means, including recognizing their faces, voices, and handwriting. Proof of signing is handled by signatures on letterhead paper, raised seals, and so on. Tampering can usually be detected by 765 handwriting, ink, and paper experts. None of these options are available electron- ically. Clearly, othersolutionsare needed. Before getting into the solutions themselves, it is worth spending a few moments considering where intheprotocol stack network security belongs. There is probably no one single place. Every layer has something to contribute. In the physicallayer, wiretapping can be foiled byenclosing transmission lines (orbetter yet, optical fibers) in sealed tubes containing an inert gas at high pressure. Any attempt to drill into a tube will release some gas, reducing the pressure and trig- gering analarm. Some militarysystems usethistechnique', 'Inthedata linklayer, packets onapoint-to-point line can beencrypted as they leave one machine and decrypted as they enter another. All the details can be handled in the data link layer, with higher layers oblivious to what is going on. This solution breaks down when packets have totraverse multiplerouters, howev- er, because packets have to be decrypted at each router, leaving them vulnerable to attacks from within the router. Also, it does not allow some sessions to be pro- tected (e.g., those involving online purchases by credit card) and others not. Nevertheless, link encryption, as this method is called, can be added to any net- workeasily andisoftenuseful. In the network layer, firewalls can be installed to keep good packets and bad packets out. IPsecurity also functions inthislayer. In the transport layer, entire connections can be encrypted end to end, that is, process toprocess. Formaximum security, end-to-end security isrequired. Finally, issues such as user authentication and nonrepudiation can only be handled intheapplication layer. Since security doesnotfitneatly intoany layer, itdoes notfitinto anychapter ofthisbook. Forthisreason, itrates itsownchapter. While this chapter is long, technical, and essential, it is also quasi-irrelevant forthe moment. Itiswell documented that most security failures at banks, forex- ample, are due to lax security procedures and incompetent employees, numerous implementation bugs that enable remote break-ins by unauthorized users, and so- called social engineering attacks, where customers are tricked into revealing their account details. All of these security problems are more prevalent than clever criminals tapping phone lines and then decoding encrypted messages. If a person can walk into a random branch of a bank with an ATM slip he foundonthe street claiming to have forgotten his PIN and get a new one on the spot (in the name of goodcustomer relations), all the cryptographyinthe world willnotprevent abuse. In this respect, Ross Anderson’s (2008a) book is a real eye-opener, as it docu- ments hundreds of examples of security failures in numerous industries, nearly all of them due to what might politely be called sloppy business practices or inatten- tion to security. Nevertheless, the technical foundation on which e-commerce is builtwhenallofthese otherfactors are donewell iscryptography. Except for physical layer security, nearly all network security is based on cryptographic principles. For this reason, we will begin our study of security by 766 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 examining cryptography in some detail. In Sec. 8.1, we will look at some of the basic principles. In Sec. 8-2 through Sec. 8-5, we will examine some of the fun- damental algorithms and data structures used in cryptography. Then we will ex- amine in detail how these concepts can be used to achieve security in networks. We willconclude withsomebrief thoughtsabouttechnologyandsociety. Before starting, one last thought is in order: what is not covered. We have tried to focus on networking issues, rather than operating system and application issues, although the line is often hard to draw. For example, there is nothing here about user authentication using biometrics, password security, buffer overflow at- tacks, Trojan horses, loginspoofing,code injection such as cross-site scripting, vi- ruses, worms, and the like', 'All of these topics are covered at length in Chap. 9 of Modern Operating Systems (Tanenbaum, 2007). The interested reader is referred tothatbookforthesystems aspects ofsecurity. Nowletusbeginourjourney. 8.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY Cryptography comes from the Greek words for ‘‘secret writing.’’ It has a long and colorful history going back thousands of years. In this section, we will just sketch some of the highlights, as background information for what follows. For a complete history of cryptography, Kahn’s (1995) book is recommended reading. For a comprehensive treatment of modern security and cryptographic al- gorithms, protocols, and applications, and related material, see Kaufman et al. (2002). For a more mathematical approach, see Stinson (2002). For a less mathematical approach, see Burnett andPaine (2001). Professionals make a distinction between ciphers and codes. A cipher is a character-for-character or bit-for-bit transformation, without regard to the linguis- tic structure of the message. In contrast, a code replaces one word with another word or symbol. Codes are not used any more, although they have a glorious his- tory. The most successful code ever devised was used by the U.S. armed forces during World War II in the Pacific. They simply had Navajo Indians talking to each other using specific Navajo words for military terms, for example chay-da- gahi-nail-tsaidi (literally: tortoise killer) for antitank weapon. The Navajo lan- guage is highly tonal, exceedingly complex, and has no written form. And not a single personinJapan knewanythingaboutit. In September 1945, the San Diego Union described the code by saying ‘‘For three years, wherever the Marines landed, the Japanese got an earful of strange gurgling noises interspersed with other sounds resembling the call of a Tibetan monk and the sound of a hot water bottle being emptied.’’ The Japanese never broke the code and many Navajo code talkers were awarded high military honors for extraordinary service and bravery. The fact that the U.S. broke the Japanese code but the Japanese never broke the Navajo code played a crucial role in the American victories inthePacific. SEC. 8.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY 767 8.1.1 Introduction to Cryptography Historically, four groups of people have used and contributed to the art of cryptography:the military,thediplomatic corps, diarists, andlovers. Ofthese, the military has had the most important role and has shaped the field over the centu- ries. Within military organizations, the messages to be encrypted have tradition- ally been given to poorly paid, low-level code clerks for encryption and transmis- sion. The sheer volume of messages prevented this work from being done by a few elitespecialists. Until the advent of computers, one of the main constraints on cryptography had been the ability of the code clerk to perform the necessary transformations, often on a battlefield with little equipment. An additional constraint has been the difficulty in switching over quickly from one cryptographic method to another one, since this entails retraining a large number of people. However, the danger of a code clerk being captured by the enemy has made it essential to be able to change the cryptographic method instantly if need be. These conflicting re- quirements havegivenrisetothemodelofFig.8-2', 'Passive Active Intruder intruder intruder just canalter listens messages Encryption Decryption Plaintext,P Plaintext,P method,E method,D Ciphertext,C=E (P) K Encryption Decryption key,K key,K Figure8-2. Theencryptionmodel(forasymmetric-keycipher). The messages to be encrypted, known as the plaintext, are transformed by a function that is parameterized by a key. The output of the encryption process, knownastheciphertext,isthentransmitted,often bymessenger orradio. We as- sume that the enemy, or intruder, hears and accurately copies down the complete ciphertext. However, unlike the intended recipient, he does not know what the decryption key is and so cannot decrypt the ciphertext easily. Sometimes the in- truder can not onlylisten to the communication channel (passive intruder) but can also record messages and play them back later, inject his own messages, or modi- fy legitimate messages before they get to the receiver (active intruder). The art of 768 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 breaking ciphers, known as cryptanalysis, and the art of devising them (crypto- graphy)are collectively knownascryptology. It will often be useful to have a notation for relating plaintext, ciphertext, and keys. We will use C =E (P) to mean that the encryption of the plaintext P using K key K gives the ciphertext C. Similarly, P =D (C) represents the decryption of K Ctogettheplaintext again. Itthenfollowsthat D (E (P))=P K K This notation suggests that E and D are just mathematical functions, which they are. The only tricky part is that both are functions of two parameters, and we have writtenoneofthe parameters (the key) as a subscript, rather than as an argu- ment, todistinguishitfromthemessage. A fundamental rule of cryptography is that one must assume that the crypt- analyst knows the methods used for encryption and decryption. In other words, the cryptanalyst knows how the encryption method, E, and decryption, D, of Fig.8-2 work in detail. The amount of effort necessary to invent, test, and install a new algorithm every time the old method is compromised (or thought to be compromised) has always made it impractical to keep the encryption algorithm secret. Thinkingitissecret whenitisnotdoesmore harm thangood. This is where the key enters. The key consists of a (relatively) short string that selects one of many potential encryptions. In contrast to the general method, which may only be changed every few years, the key can be changed as often as required. Thus, our basic model is a stable and publicly known general method parameterized by a secret and easily changed key. The idea that the cryptanalyst knows the algorithms and that the secrecy lies exclusively in the keys is called Kerckhoff’s principle, named after the Flemish military cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffwhofirststated itin1883(Kerckhoff,1883). Thus,wehave Kerckhoff’s principle: Allalgorithms mustbepublic;onlythekeysaresecret The nonsecrecy of the algorithm cannot be emphasized enough. Trying to keep the algorithm secret, known in the trade as security by obscurity, never works. Also, by publicizing the algorithm, the cryptographer gets free consulting from a large number of academic cryptologists eager to break the system so they can publish papers demonstrating how smart they are. If many experts have tried to break the algorithm for a long time after its publication and no one has suc- ceeded,itisprobablypretty solid', 'Since the real secrecy isinthe key, itslength isa major design issue. Consid- er a simple combination lock. The general principle is that you enter digits in se- quence. Everyone knows this, but the key is secret. A key length of two digits means that there are 100 possibilities. A key length of three digits means 1000 possibilities, and a key length of six digits means a million. The longer the key, the higher the work factor the cryptanalyst has to deal with. The work factor for breaking the system by exhaustive search of the key space is exponential in the SEC. 8.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY 769 keylength. Secrecy comes from having astrong(butpublic)algorithm andalong key. To prevent your kid brother from reading your email, 64-bit keys will do. For routine commercial use, at least 128 bits should be used. To keep major gov- ernments atbay,keysofatleast 256bits,preferably more, are needed. From the cryptanalyst’s point of view, the cryptanalysis problem has three principal variations. When he has a quantity of ciphertext and no plaintext, he is confronted with the ciphertext-only problem. The cryptograms that appear in the puzzle section of newspapers pose this kind of problem. When the cryptanalyst has some matched ciphertext and plaintext, the problem is called the known plaintext problem. Finally, when the cryptanalyst has the ability to encrypt pieces of plaintext of his own choosing, we have the chosen plaintext problem. Newspaper cryptograms could be broken trivially ifthe cryptanalyst were allowed toasksuchquestionsas‘‘What istheencryption ofABCDEFGHIJKL?’’ Novices in the cryptography business often assume that if a cipher can with- stand a ciphertext-only attack, it is secure. This assumption is very naive. In many cases, the cryptanalyst can make a good guess at parts of the plaintext. For example, the first thing many computers say when you call them up is ‘‘login:’’. Equipped with some matched plaintext-ciphertext pairs, the cryptanalyst’s job be- comes much easier. To achieve security, the cryptographer should be conserva- tive and make sure that the system is unbreakable even if his opponent can en- crypt arbitrary amountsofchosen plaintext. Encryption methodshave historically been divided into twocategories: substi- tution ciphers and transposition ciphers. We will now deal with each of these briefly asbackgroundinformation formoderncryptography. 8.1.2 Substitution Ciphers In a substitution cipher, each letter or group of letters is replaced by another letter or group of letters to disguise it. One of the oldest known ciphers is the Caesar cipher,attributed toJulius Caesar. With this method, abecomes D, bbe- comes E, c becomes F, ..., and z becomes C. For example, attack becomes DWWDFN. In our examples, plaintext will be given in lowercase letters, and ciphertext inuppercaseletters. A slight generalization of the Caesar cipher allows the ciphertext alphabet to be shifted by k letters, instead of always three. In this case, k becomes a key to the general method of circularly shifted alphabets. The Caesar cipher may have fooled Pompey, butithasnotfooled anyonesince. The next improvement istohave each of the symbols inthe plaintext, say, the 26letters forsimplicity, mapontosome otherletter', 'Forexample, plaintext: a b c d e f g h i j k l mn o p q r s t u vwx y z ciphertext: QWE R TYU I O P A S D F GH J KL ZXCVBNM 770 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 The general system ofsymbol-for-symbol substitutioniscalled amonoalphabetic substitution cipher, with the key being the 26-letter string corresponding to the full alphabet. For the key just given, the plaintext attack would be transformed intotheciphertext QZZQEA. At first glance this might appear to be a safe system because although the cryptanalyst knows the general system (letter-for-letter substitution), he does not know which of the 26! ∼∼4×1026 possible keys is in use. In contrast with the Caesar cipher, trying all of them is not a promising approach. Even at 1 nsec per solution, a million computer chips working in parallel would take 10,000 years to tryallthekeys. Nevertheless, given a surprisingly small amount of ciphertext, the cipher can be broken easily. The basic attack takes advantage of the statistical properties of natural languages. InEnglish, for example, e is the most common letter, followed by t, o, a, n, i, etc. The most common two-letter combinations, or digrams, are th, in, er, re, and an. The most common three-letter combinations, or trigrams, are the,ing,and,andion. A cryptanalyst trying to break a monoalphabetic cipher would start out by counting the relative frequencies of all letters in the ciphertext. Then he might tentatively assign the most common one to e and the next most common one to t. He would then look at trigrams to find a common one of the form tXe, which stronglysuggeststhat Xish. Similarly, ifthe pattern thYt occurs frequently, the Y probably stands for a. With this information, he can look for a frequently oc- curring trigram of the form aZW, which is most likely and. By making guesses at common letters, digrams, and trigrams and knowing about likely patterns of vowels and consonants, the cryptanalyst builds up a tentative plaintext, letter by letter. Another approach is to guess a probable word or phrase. For example, con- sider the following ciphertext from an accounting firm (blocked into groups of five characters): CTBMN BYCTC BTJDS QXBNS GSTJC BTSWX CTQTZ CQVUJ QJSGS TJQZZ MNQJS VLNSX VSZJU JDSTS JQUUS JUBXJ DSKSU JSNTK BGAQJ ZBGYQ TLCTZ BNYBN QJSW A likely word in a message from an accounting firm is financial. Using our knowledge that financial has a repeated letter (i), with four other letters between their occurrences, we look for repeated letters in the ciphertext at this spacing. We find 12 hits, at positions 6, 15, 27, 31, 42, 48, 56, 66, 70, 71, 76, and 82. However, only two of these, 31and 42,have the next letter (corresponding to n in the plaintext) repeated in the proper place. Of these two, only 31 also has the a correctly positioned, so we know that financial begins at position 30. From this point on, deducing the key is easy by using the frequency statistics for English textandlookingfornearly complete wordstofinishoff. SEC', '8.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY 771 8.1.3 Transposition Ciphers Substitution ciphers preserve the order of the plaintext symbols but disguise them. Transposition ciphers, in contrast, reorder the letters but do not disguise them. Figure 8-3 depicts a common transposition cipher, the columnar transposi- tion. The cipher is keyed by a word or phrase not containing any repeated letters. In this example, MEGABUCK is the key. The purpose of the key is to order the columns, with column 1being underthe key letter closest tothe start ofthe alpha- bet, and so on. The plaintext is written horizontally, in rows, padded to fill the matrix ifneed be. The ciphertext isread outbycolumns, starting with the column whose keyletter isthelowest.

Atranspositioncipher. To break a transposition cipher, the cryptanalyst must first be aware that he is dealing with a transposition cipher. By looking at the frequency of E, T, A, O, I, N,etc., itiseasy tosee ifthey fit the normal pattern forplaintext. Ifso,the cipher isclearly atranspositioncipher, becauseinsuchacipher every letter represents it- self, keeping thefrequency distribution intact. The next step is to make a guess at the number of columns. In many cases, a probable word or phrase may be guessed at from the context. For example, sup- pose that our cryptanalyst suspects that the plaintext phrase milliondollars occurs somewhere inthe message. Observe that digrams MO,IL,LL,LA,IR,and OSoc- cur in the ciphertext as a result of this phrase wrapping around. The ciphertext letter O follows the ciphertext letter M (i.e., they are vertically adjacentincolumn 4)becausetheyare separated inthe probable phrase bya distance equal tothe key length. If a key of length seven had been used, the digrams MD, IO, LL, LL, IA, OR, and NS would have occurred instead. In fact, for each key length, a different set of digrams is produced in the ciphertext. By hunting for the various possibili- ties, thecryptanalyst canoften easily determine thekeylength. 772 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 The remaining step is to order the columns. When the number of columns, k, is small, each of the k(k −1) column pairs can be examined in turn to see if its digram frequencies match those for English plaintext. The pair with the best match is assumed to be correctly positioned. Now each of the remaining columns istentatively tried asthesuccessortothispair. The column whose digram and tri- gram frequencies give the best match is tentatively assumed to be correct. The next column is foundin the same way. The entire process is continued until a po- tential ordering is found. Chances are that the plaintext will be recognizable at thispoint(e.g., ifmilloinoccurs, itisclear what theerror is)', 'Some transposition ciphers accept a fixed-length block of input and produce a fixed-length block of output. These ciphers can be completely described by giv- ing a list telling the order in which the characters are to be output. For example, the cipher of Fig. 8-3 can be seen as a 64 character block cipher. Its output is 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 5, 13,..., 62. In other words, the fourth input charac- ter, a,isthefirsttobeoutput,followed bythetwelfth, f,andsoon. 8.1.4 One-Time Pads Constructing an unbreakable cipher is actually quite easy; the technique has been known for decades. First choose a random bit string as the key. Then con- vert the plaintext into a bit string, for example, by using its ASCII representation. Finally, compute the XOR (eXclusive OR)ofthese twostrings, bitbybit. The re- sulting ciphertext cannot be broken because in a sufficiently large sample of ciphertext, each letter will occur equally often, as will every digram, every tri- gram, andsoon. Thismethod,knownas the one-time pad,isimmune toall pres- ent and future attacks, no matter how much computational power the intruder has. The reason derives from information theory: there is simply no information in the message becauseall possibleplaintexts ofthegivenlengthare equally likely. An example of how one-time pads are used is given in Fig. 8-4. First, mes- sage 1, ‘‘I love you.’’ is converted to 7-bit ASCII. Then a one-time pad, pad 1, is chosen and XORed with the message to get the ciphertext. A cryptanalyst could try all possible one-time pads to see what plaintext came out for each one. For example, the one-time pad listed as pad 2 in the figure could be tried, resulting in plaintext 2, ‘‘Elvis lives’’, which may or may not be plausible (a subject beyond the scope of this book). In fact, for every 11-character ASCII plaintext, there is a one-time pad that generates it. That is what we mean by saying there is no infor- mation intheciphertext: youcangetanymessage ofthecorrect lengthoutofit. One-time padsare great intheory buthave a number ofdisadvantages inprac- tice. To start with, the key cannot be memorized, so both sender and receiver must carry a written copy with them. If either one is subject to capture, written keys are clearly undesirable. Additionally, the total amount of data that can be transmittedislimited bythe amount of key available. If the spy strikes it rich and discovers a wealth of data, he may find himself unable to transmit them back to SEC. 8.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY 773 Message1: 1001001 0100000 1101100 1101111 1110110 1100101 0100000 1111001 1101111 1110101 0101110 Pad1: 1010010 1001011 1110010 1010101 1010010 1100011 0001011 0101010 1010111 1100110 0101011 Ciphertext: 0011011 1101011 0011110 0111010 0100100 0000110 0101011 1010011 0111000 0010011 0000101 Pad2: 1011110 0000111 1101000 1010011 1010111 0100110 1000111 0111010 1001110 1110110 1110110 Plaintext2: 1000101 1101100 1110110 1101001 1110011 0100000 1101100 1101001 1110110 1100101 1110011 Figure8-4.

Another problem is the sensitivi- ty of the method to lost or inserted characters. If the sender and receiver get out ofsynchronization, alldata fromthenonwillappear garbled', 'With the advent of computers, the one-time pad might potentially become practical for some applications. The source of the key could be a special DVD that contains several gigabytes of information and, if transported in a DVD movie box and prefixed by a few minutes of video, would not even be suspicious. Of course, at gigabit network speeds, having to insert a new DVD every 30 sec could become tedious. And the DVDs must be personally carried fromthe sender tothe receiver before any messages can be sent, which greatly reduces their practical utility. Quantum Cryptography Interestingly, there may be a solution to the problem of how to transmit the one-time pad over the network, and it comes from a very unlikely source: quant- um mechanics. This area is still experimental, butinitial tests are promising. If it can be perfected and be made efficient, virtually all cryptography will eventually bedoneusingone-time pads since they are provably secure. Below we will brief- ly explain how this method, quantum cryptography, works. In particular, we willdescribe aprotocol called BB84 after itsauthors and publicationyear (Bennet andBrassard, 1984). Suppose that a user, Alice, wants to establish a one-time pad with a second user, Bob. Alice and Bob are called principals, the main characters in our story. For example, Bob is a banker with whom Alice would like to do business. The names ‘‘Alice’’ and ‘‘Bob’’ have been used for the principals in virtually every paper and book on cryptography since Ron Rivest introduced them many years ago (Rivest et al., 1978). Cryptographers love tradition. If we were to use ‘‘Andy’’ and ‘‘Barbara’’ as the principals, no one would believe anything in this chapter. Sobeit. IfAlice and Bobcould establish a one-time pad, they could use itto commun- icate securely. The question is: how can they establish it without previously exchanging DVDs? We can assume that Alice and Bob are at the opposite ends 774 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 of an optical fiber over which they can send and receive light pulses. However, an intrepid intruder, Trudy, can cut the fiber to splice in an active tap. Trudy can read all the bits sent in both directions. She can also send false messages in both directions. The situation might seem hopeless for Alice and Bob, but quantum cryptographycan shedsomenew lightonthesubject. Quantum cryptography is based on the fact that light comes in little packets called photons, which have some peculiar properties. Furthermore, light can be polarized by being passed through a polarizing filter, a fact well known to both sunglasses wearers and photographers. If a beam of light (i.e., a stream of pho- tons) is passed througha polarizing filter, all the photons emerging from it will be polarized in the direction of the filter’s axis (e.g., vertically). If the beam is now passed through a second polarizing filter, the intensity of the light emerging from the second filter is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the axes. If the two axes are perpendicular, no photons get through', \"The absolute orientation of the two filters does not matter; only the angle between their axes counts. Togenerate aone-time pad,Alice needs twosets ofpolarizing filters. Set one consists of a vertical filter and a horizontal filter. This choice is called a rectil- inear basis. Abasis (plural: bases) isjust a coordinate system. The second set of filters is the same, except rotated 45degrees, so one filter runs from the lower left to the upper right and the other filter runs from the upper left to the lower right. This choice is called a diagonal basis. Thus, Alice has two bases, which she can rapidly insert into her beam at will. In reality, Alice does not have four separate filters, but a crystal whose polarization can be switched electrically to any of the four allowed directions at great speed. Bob has the same equipment as Alice. The fact that Alice and Bob each have two bases available is essential to quantum cryptography. For eachbasis, Alice nowassigns onedirection as 0and the other as 1. In the example presented below, we assume she chooses vertical to be 0 and horizontal to be 1. Independently, she also chooses lower left to upper right as 0 and upper left tolower rightas1. Shesendsthese choices toBobasplaintext. NowAlice picks a one-time pad, forexample based ona randomnumber gen- erator (a complex subject all byitself). She transfers it bitbybittoBob, choosing one of her two bases at random for each bit. To send a bit, her photon gun emits one photon polarized appropriately for the basis she is using for that bit. For ex- ample, she might choose bases of diagonal, rectilinear, rectilinear, diagonal, rec- tilinear, etc. To send her one-time pad of 1001110010100110 with these bases, she would send the photonsshown in Fig. 8-5(a). Given the one-time pad and the sequence of bases, the polarization to use for each bit is uniquely determined. Bitssentonephotonatatimeare called qubits. Bobdoes notknowwhich bases touse, sohe picks one at randomfor each ar- riving photon and just uses it, as shown in Fig. 8-5(b). If he picks the correct basis, he gets the correct bit. If he picks the incorrect basis, he gets a random bit SEC. 8.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY 775 Bit number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Data 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 What (a) Alice sends Bob's (b) bases What (c) Bob gets Correct (d) No Yes No Yes No No No Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes No Yes No basis?

Anexampleofquantumcryptography. because if a photon hits a filter polarized at 45 degrees to its own polarization, it randomly jumps to the polarization of the filter or to a polarization perpendicular to the filter, with equal probability. This property of photons is fundamental to quantum mechanics\", 'Thus, some of the bits are correct and some are random, but Bobdoesnotknowwhichare which. Bob’sresults are depicted inFig.8-5(c). Howdoes Bobfind outwhich bases hegotright andwhich he gotwrong? He simply tells Alice which basis he used for each bit in plaintext and she tells him which are right and which are wrong in plaintext, as shown in Fig.8-5(d). From this information, both of them can build a bit string from the correct guesses, as shown in Fig.8-5(e). On the average, this bit string will be half the length of the original bit string,butsince bothparties knowit,theycan useitasaone-time pad. All Alice has to do is transmit a bit string slightly more than twice the desired length, andsheandBobwillhave aone-time padofthedesired length. Done. But wait a minute. We forgot Trudy. Suppose that she is curious about what Alice has to say and cuts the fiber, inserting her own detector and transmitter. Unfortunately for her, she does not know which basis to use for each photon ei- ther. The best she can doispick oneat randomforeachphoton,just as Bobdoes. An example of her choices is shown in Fig. 8-5(f). When Bob later reports (in plaintext) which bases he used and Alice tells him (in plaintext) which ones are 776 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 correct, Trudy now knows when she got it right and when she got it wrong. In Fig.8-5, she got it right for bits 0, 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,and13. But she knowsfrom Alice’s reply in Fig.8-5(d) that only bits 1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14 are part of the one-time pad. For four of these bits (1, 3, 8, and 12), she guessed right and captured the correct bit. For the other four (7, 10, 11, and 14), she guessed wrong and does not know the bit transmitted. Thus, Bob knows the one-time pad starts with01011001,fromFig. 8-5(e)butallTrudyhasis01?1??0?, fromFig.8-5(g). Of course, Alice and Bob are aware that Trudy may have captured part of their one-time pad, so they would like to reduce the information Trudy has. They can do this by performing a transformation on it. For example, they could divide the one-time pad into blocks of 1024 bits, square each one to form a 2048-bit number, anduse the concatenation of these 2048-bitnumbers as the one-time pad. With her partial knowledge of the bit string transmitted, Trudy has noway togen- erate itssquare andsohas nothing. The transformation from the original one-time pad to a different one that reduces Trudy’s knowledge is called privacy amplifi- cation. In practice, complex transformations in which every output bit depends onevery inputbitare usedinstead ofsquaring. Poor Trudy. Notonlydoes she have noidea what the one-time pad is, but her presence is not a secret either. After all, she must relay each received bit to Bob totrick himintothinkingheistalking toAlice. Thetroubleis, the best she can do istransmit the qubitshe received,usingthe polarization sheusedtoreceiveit,and abouthalf thetime shewillbewrong,causing manyerrors inBob’sone-time pad. When Alice finally starts sending data, she encodes it using a heavy forward- error-correcting code. From Bob’s point of view, a1-bit error inthe one-time pad is the same as a 1-bit transmission error. Either way, he gets the wrong bit', 'If there is enough forward error correction, he can recover the original message despite all the errors, but he can easily count how many errors were corrected. If this number is far more than the expected error rate of the equipment, he knows that Trudyhas tapped the line and can act accordingly (e.g., tell Alice to switch to a radio channel, call the police, etc.). If Trudy hadaway toclone aphotonsoshe had one photon to inspect and an identical photon to send to Bob, she could avoid detection, butatpresent nowaytoclone aphotonperfectly isknown. Andevenif Trudy could clone photons, the value of quantum cryptography to establish one- time padswouldnotbereduced. Although quantum cryptography has been shown to operate over distances of 60km of fiber, the equipment is complex and expensive. Still, the idea has prom- ise. Formore information aboutquantumcryptography,see Mullins(2002). 8.1.5 Two Fundamental Cryptographic Principles Although we will study many different cryptographic systems in the pages ahead, two principles underlying all of them are important to understand. Pay attention. Youviolate thematyourperil. SEC. 8.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY 777 Redundancy The first principle is that all encrypted messages must contain some redun- dancy, that is, information not needed to understand the message. An example may make it clear why this is needed. Consider a mail-order company, The Couch Potato (TCP), with 60,000 products. Thinking they are being very effi- cient, TCP’s programmers decide that ordering messages should consist of a 16- byte customer name followed by a 3-byte data field (1 byte for the quantity and 2 bytes for the product number). The last 3 bytes are to be encrypted using a very longkeyknownonlybythecustomer andTCP. At first, this might seem secure, and in a sense it is because passive intruders cannot decrypt the messages. Unfortunately, it also has a fatal flaw that renders it useless. Suppose that a recently fired employee wants to punish TCP for firing her. Just before leaving, she takes the customer list with her. She works through the night writing a program to generate fictitious orders using real customer names. Since she does not have the list of keys, she just puts random numbers in thelast 3bytes, andsendshundredsoforders offtoTCP. When these messages arrive, TCP’s computer uses the customers’ name to locate the key and decrypt the message. Unfortunately for TCP, almost every 3- byte message is valid, so the computer begins printing out shipping instructions. While it might seem odd for a customer to order 837 sets of children’s swings or 540 sandboxes, for all the computer knows, the customer might be planning to open a chain of franchised playgrounds. In this way, an active intruder (the ex- employee) can cause a massive amount of trouble, even though she cannot under- standthemessages hercomputer isgenerating. This problem can be solved by the addition of redundancy to all messages. For example, if order messages are extended to 12bytes, the first 9ofwhich must be zeros, this attack no longer works because the ex-employee can no longer gen- erate a large stream of valid messages', 'The moral ofthe storyisthat all messages mustcontain considerable redundancysothat active intruders cannotsend random junkandhave itbeinterpreted asavalidmessage. However, adding redundancy makes it easier for cryptanalysts to break mes- sages. Suppose that the mail-order business ishighly competitive,and The Couch Potato’s main competitor, The Sofa Tuber, would dearly love to know how many sandboxes TCP is selling so it taps TCP’s phone line. In the original scheme with 3-byte messages, cryptanalysis was nearly impossible because after guessing a key, the cryptanalyst had no way of telling whether it was right because almost every message was technically legal. With the new 12-byte scheme, it is easy for thecryptanalyst totell avalidmessage fromaninvalid one. Thus,wehave Cryptographicprinciple 1:Messages mustcontainsome redundancy In other words, upon decrypting a message, the recipient must be able to tell whether it is valid by simply inspecting the message and perhaps performing a 778 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 simple computation. This redundancy is needed to prevent active intruders from sending garbage and tricking the receiver into decrypting the garbage and acting on the ‘‘plaintext.’’ However, this same redundancy makes it much easier for pas- sive intruders tobreak the system, sothere issome tension here. Furthermore, the redundancy should never be in the form of n 0s at the start or end of a message, since running such messages through some cryptographic algorithms gives more predictable results, making the cryptanalysts’ job easier. A CRC polynomial is much better than a run of 0s since the receiver can easily verify it, butit generates more work for the cryptanalyst. Even better is to use a cryptographic hash, a con- cept wewillexplore later. Forthemoment, thinkofitasabetter CRC. Getting back toquantum cryptography for a moment, we can also see how re- dundancy plays a role there. Due to Trudy’s interception of the photons, some bits in Bob’s one-time pad will be wrong. Bob needs some redundancy in the in- coming messages to determine that errors are present. One very crude form ofre- dundancy is repeating the message two times. If the two copies are not identical, Bob knows that either the fiber is very noisy or someone is tampering with the transmission. Of course, sending everything twice is overkill; a Hamming or Reed-Solomon code is a more efficient way to do error detection and correction. But it should be clear that some redundancy is needed to distinguish a valid mes- sage fromaninvalid message, especially inthefaceofanactive intruder. Freshness The second cryptographic principle is that measures must be taken to ensure that each message received can be verified as being fresh, that is, sent very recently. This measure is needed to prevent active intruders from playing back old messages. If no such measures were taken, our ex-employee could tap TCP’s phonelineandjustkeep repeating previously sent validmessages. Thus, Cryptographicprinciple 2:Somemethodisneeded tofoilreplay attacks One such measure is including in every message a timestamp valid only for, say, 10 seconds. The receiver can then just keep messages around for 10 seconds and compare newly arrived messages to previous ones to filter out duplicates', 'Mes- sages older than 10 seconds can be thrown out, since any replays sent more than 10 seconds later will be rejected as too old. Measures other than timestamps will bediscussed later. 8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS Modern cryptography uses the same basic ideas as traditional cryptography (transposition and substitution), but its emphasis is different. Traditionally, cryp- tographers have used simple algorithms. Nowadays, the reverse is true: the object SEC. 8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 779 is to make the encryption algorithm so complex and involuted that even if the cryptanalyst acquires vast moundsof enciphered text of his own choosing, he will notbeable tomake anysense ofitatallwithoutthekey. The first class of encryption algorithms we will study in this chapter are call- ed symmetric-key algorithms because they use the same key for encryption and decryption. Fig. 8-2 illustrates the use of a symmetric-key algorithm. In particu- lar, we will focus on block ciphers, which take an n-bit block of plaintext as inputandtransform itusingthekeyintoann-bitblockofciphertext. Cryptographic algorithms can be implemented in either hardware (for speed) or software (for flexibility). Although most of our treatment concerns the algo- rithms and protocols, which are independent of the actual implementation, a few words about building cryptographic hardware may be of interest. Transpositions and substitutions can be implemented with simple electrical circuits. Figure 8- 6(a) showsadevice, knownas aP-box (Pstandsforpermutation), usedtoeffect a transposition on an 8-bit input. If the 8 bits are designated from top to bottom as 01234567, the output of this particular P-box is 36071245. By appropriate inter- nal wiring, a P-box can be made to perform any transposition and do it at practi- cally the speed of light since no computation is involved, just signal propagation. This design follows Kerckhoff’s principle: the attacker knows that the general methodispermuting thebits. What hedoesnotknowiswhichbitgoeswhere.

Basicelementsofproductciphers.(a)P-box.(b)S-box.(c)Product. Substitutions are performed by S-boxes, as shown in Fig.8-6(b). In this ex- ample, a 3-bit plaintext is entered and a 3-bit ciphertext is output. The 3-bit input selects one of the eight lines exiting from the first stage and sets it to 1; all the other lines are 0. The second stage is a P-box. The third stage encodes the selec- ted input line in binary again.With the wiring shown, if the eight octal numbers 01234567 were input one after another, the output sequence would be 24506713. Inother words,0has been replacedby2,1has been replacedby4,etc. Again, by appropriate wiring of the P-box inside the S-box, any substitution can be accom- plished. Furthermore, such a device can be built in hardware to achieve great speed, since encoders and decoders have only one or two (subnanosecond) gate delays andthepropagation timeacross theP-boxmaywell belessthan1picosec. 780 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 The real power of these basic elements only becomes apparent when we cas- cade a whole series of boxes to form a product cipher, as shown in Fig. 8-6(c)', 'In this example, 12 input lines are transposed (i.e., permuted) by the first stage (P ). Inthesecondstage, theinputisbrokenupintofourgroupsof3bits,eachof 1 which is substituted independently of the others (S to S ). This arrangement 1 4 shows a method of approximating a larger S-box from multiple, smaller S-boxes. It is useful because small S-boxes are practical for a hardware implementation (e.g., an 8-bit S-box can be realized as a 256-entry lookup table), but large S- boxes become unwieldy to build (e.g., a 12-bit S-box would at a minimum need 212 =4096 crossed wires in its middle stage). Althoughthis method is less gener- al, it is still powerful. By inclusion of a sufficiently large number of stages in the product cipher, the output can be made tobe an exceedingly complicated function oftheinput. Product ciphers that operate on k-bit inputs to produce k-bit outputs are very common. Typically, k is 64 to 256. A hardware implementation usually has at least 10 physical stages, instead of just 7 as in Fig. 8-6(c). A software imple- mentation is programmed as a loop with at least eight iterations, each one per- forming S-box-type substitutions on subblocks of the 64- to 256-bit data block, followed by a permutation that mixes the outputs of the S-boxes. Often there is a special initial permutation and one at the end as well. In the literature, the itera- tionsare called rounds. 8.2.1 DES—The Data Encryption Standard In January 1977, the U.S. Government adopted a product cipher developed by IBM as its official standard for unclassified information. This cipher, DES (Data Encryption Standard), was widely adopted by the industry for use in security products. It is no longer secure in its original form, but in a modified form it is stilluseful. We willnowexplain howDES works. An outline of DES is shown in Fig.8-7(a). Plaintext is encrypted in blocks of 64bits, yielding 64bits ofciphertext. The algorithm, which isparameterized bya 56-bit key, has 19 distinct stages. The first stage is a key-independent transposi- tion on the 64-bit plaintext. The last stage is the exact inverse of this transposi- tion. The stage prior to the last one exchanges the leftmost 32 bits with the right- most 32 bits. The remaining 16 stages are functionally identical but are parame- terized by different functions of the key. The algorithm has been designed to allow decryption tobe donewith the same keyas encryption, aproperty needed in anysymmetric-key algorithm. The stepsare justruninthereverse order. The operation of one of these intermediate stages is illustrated in Fig. 8-7(b). Each stage takes two 32-bit inputs and produces two 32-bit outputs. The left out- put is simply a copy of the right input. The right output is the bitwise XOR of the left input and a function of the right input and the key for this stage, K . Pretty i muchallthecomplexity ofthealgorithm lies inthisfunction.

This i output isthen partitionedinto eight groupsof6bitseach,eachofwhich isfedinto a different S-box. Each of the 64 possible inputs to an S-box is mapped onto a 4- bitoutput. Finally, these 8×4bitsare passed throughaP-box. In each of the 16 iterations, a different key is used. Before the algorithm starts, a 56-bit transposition is applied to the key. Just before each iteration, the key is partitioned into two 28-bit units, each of which is rotated left by a number of bits dependent on the iteration number. K is derived from this rotated key by i applying yet another 56-bit transposition to it. A different 48-bit subset of the 56 bitsisextracted andpermuted oneachround. A technique that is sometimes used to make DES stronger is called whiten- ing. It consists of XORing a random 64-bit key with each plaintext block before feeding it into DES and then XORing a second 64-bit key with the resulting ciphertext before transmitting it. Whitening can easily be removed byrunningthe 782 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 reverse operations (if the receiver has the two whitening keys). Since this techni- que effectively adds more bits to the key length, it makes an exhaustive search of the key space much more time consuming. Note that the same whitening key is usedforeachblock(i.e., there isonlyonewhitening key). DES has been enveloped in controversy since the day it was launched. It was based on a cipher developed and patented by IBM, called Lucifer, except that IBM’s cipher used a 128-bit key instead of a 56-bit key. When the U.S. Federal Government wanted to standardize ononecipher forunclassified use, it ‘‘invited’’ IBM to ‘‘discuss’’ the matter with NSA, the U.S. Government’s code-breaking arm, which is the world’s largest employer of mathematicians and cryptologists. NSAissosecret thatanindustryjokegoes: Q:What doesNSAstand for? A:NoSuchAgency. Actually, NSAstandsforNational Security Agency. After these discussions took place, IBM reduced the key from 128 bits to 56 bits and decided to keep secret the process by which DES was designed. Many people suspected that the key length was reduced to make sure that NSA could just break DES, but noorganization with a smaller budgetcould. The point ofthe secret design was supposedly to hide a back door that could make it even easier for NSA to break DES. When an NSA employee discreetly told IEEE to cancel a planned conference on cryptography, that did not make people any more comfort- able. NSAdenied everything. In 1977, two Stanford cryptography researchers, Diffie and Hellman (1977), designed a machine to break DES and estimated that it could be built for 20 mil- lion dollars. Given a small piece of plaintext and matched ciphertext, this ma- chine could find the key by exhaustive search of the 256-entry key space in under 1 day. Nowadays, the game is up. Such a machine exists, is for sale, and costs lessthan$10,000tomake (Kumar etal., 2006)', 'Triple DES As early as 1979, IBM realized that the DES key length was too short and de- vised a way to effectively increase it, using triple encryption (Tuchman, 1979). The method chosen, which has since been incorporated in International Standard 8732, is illustrated in Fig. 8-8. Here, two keys and three stages are used. In the first stage, the plaintext is encrypted using DES in the usual way with K . In the 1 secondstage, DES isrunindecryption mode,usingK asthekey. Finally, anoth- 2 erDES encryption isdonewithK . 1 This design immediately gives rise to two questions. First, why are only two keys used, instead of three? Second, why is EDE (Encrypt Decrypt Encrypt) used, instead ofEEE(Encrypt Encrypt Encrypt)? The reason that two keys are used is that even the most paranoid of cryptographers believe that 112 bits is SEC. 8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 783 K K K K K K 1 2 1 1 2 1 P E D E C C D E D P (a) (b) Figure8-8. (a)TripleencryptionusingDES.(b)Decryption. adequate for routine commercial applications for the time being. (And among cryptographers, paranoia is considered a feature, not a bug.) Going to 168 bits would just add the unnecessary overhead of managing and transporting another keyforlittlereal gain. The reason for encrypting, decrypting, and then encrypting again is backward compatibility with existing single-key DES systems. Both the encryption and de- cryption functions are mappings between sets of 64-bit numbers. From a crypto- graphic point of view, the two mappings are equally strong. By using EDE, how- ever, instead of EEE, a computer using triple encryption can speak to one using single encryption by just setting K =K . This property allows triple encryption 1 2 to be phased in gradually, something of no concern to academic cryptographers butofconsiderable importance toIBManditscustomers. 8.2.2 AES—The Advanced Encryption Standard As DES began approaching the end of its useful life, even with triple DES, NIST (National Institute ofStandards and Technology),the agency oftheU.S. Dept. of Commerce charged with approving standards for the U.S. Federal Gov- ernment, decided that the government needed a new cryptographic standard for unclassified use. NIST was keenly aware of all the controversy surrounding DES and well knew that if it just announced a new standard, everyone knowing any- thing about cryptography would automatically assume that NSA had built a back door into it so NSA could read everything encrypted with it. Under these condi- tions,probablynoonewouldusethestandard anditwouldhave diedquietly. So, NIST took a surprisingly different approach for a government bureau- cracy: it sponsored a cryptographic bake-off (contest). In January 1997, re- searchers from all over the world were invited tosubmit proposalsfor a new stan- dard, to be called AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). The bake-off rules were: 1. The algorithm mustbeasymmetric blockcipher. 2. The fulldesignmustbepublic. 3. Keylengths of128,192,and256bitsmustbesupported. 784 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 4. Bothsoftware andhardware implementations mustbepossible. 5. The algorithm mustbepublicorlicensed onnondiscriminatoryterms. Fifteen serious proposals were made, and public conferences were organized in which they were presented and attendees were actively encouraged to find flaws inallofthem', 'InAugust1998,NIST selected five finalists, primarily onthe basis of their security, efficiency, simplicity, flexibility, and memory requirements (im- portant for embedded systems). More conferences were held and more potshots taken. In October 2000, NIST announced that it had selected Rijndael, by Joan Dae- men and Vincent Rijmen. The name Rijndael, pronounced Rhine-doll (more or less), is derived from the last names of the authors: Rijmen + Daemen. In November 2001, Rijndael became the AES U.S. Government standard, published as FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 197. Due to the extraordinary openness of the competition, the technical properties of Rijndael, and the fact that the winning team consisted of two young Belgian cryptographers (who were unlikely tohave built in a back doorjusttoplease NSA), Rijndael has become the world’s dominant cryptographic cipher. AES encryption and decryption is now part oftheinstruction setforsomemicroprocessors (e.g., Intel). Rijndael supports key lengths and block sizes from 128 bits to 256 bits in steps of 32 bits. The key length and block length may be chosen independently. However, AES specifies that the block size must be 128 bits and the key length must be 128, 192, or 256 bits. It is doubtful that anyone will ever use 192-bit keys, so de facto, AES has two variants: a 128-bit block with a 128-bit key and a 128-bitblockwitha256-bitkey. In our treatment of the algorithm, we will examine only the 128/128 case be- cause this is likely to become the commercial norm. A 128-bit key gives a key space of 2128 ∼∼3×1038 keys. Even if NSA manages to build a machine with 1 billion parallel processors, each being able to evaluate one key per picosecond, it would take such a machine about 1010 years to search the key space. By then the sun will have burned out, so the folks then present will have to read the results by candlelight. Rijndael From a mathematical perspective, Rijndael is based on Galois field theory, which gives it some provable security properties. However, it can also be viewed asCcode, withoutgettingintothemathematics. Like DES, Rijndael uses substitution and permutations, and it also uses multi- ple rounds. The number of rounds depends on the key size and block size, being 10for 128-bit keys with 128-bitblocks and moving up to 14 for the largest key or the largest block. However, unlike DES, all operations involve entire bytes, to SEC. 8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 785 allow for efficient implementations in both hardware and software. An outline of the code is given in Fig. 8-9. Note that this code is for the purpose of illustration. Good implementations of security code will follow additional practices, such as zeroing out sensitive memory after it has been used. See, for example, Ferguson etal. (2010). #defineLENGTH16 /*#bytesindatablockorkey*/ #defineNROWS4 /*numberofrowsinstate*/ #defineNCOLS4 /*numberofcolumnsinstate*/ #defineROUNDS10 /*numberofiterations*/ typedefunsignedcharbyte; /*unsigned8-bitinteger*/ rijndael(byteplaintext[LENGTH],byteciphertext[LENGTH],bytekey[LENGTH]) { intr; /*loopindex*/ bytestate[NROWS][NCOLS]; /*currentstate*/ struct{bytek[NROWS][NCOLS];} rk[ROUNDS+1]; /*roundkeys*/ expand key(key,rk); /*constructtheroundkeys*/ copy plaintext to state(state,plaintext); /*initcurrentstate*/ xor roundkey into state(state,rk[0]); /*XORkeyintostate*/ for(r=1;r<=ROUNDS;r++){ substitute(state); /*applyS-boxtoeachbyte*/ rotate rows(state); /*rotaterowibyibytes*/ if(r<ROUNDS)mix columns(state); /*mixfunction*/ xor roundkey into state(state,rk[r]); /*XORkeyintostate*/ } copy state to ciphertext(ciphertext,state); /*returnresult*/ } Figure8-9. AnoutlineofRijndaelinC. The function rijndael has three parameters', 'They are: plaintext, an array of 16bytes containing the inputdata; ciphertext,an array of16bytes where theenci- phered output will be returned; and key, the 16-byte key. During the calculation, the current state of the data is maintained in a byte array, state, whose size is NROWS ×NCOLS. For 128-bit blocks, this array is 4×4 bytes. With 16 bytes, thefull128-bitdata blockcanbestored. The state array is initialized to the plaintext and modified by every step in the computation. In some steps, byte-for-byte substitution is performed. In others, the bytes are permuted within the array. Other transformations are also used. At theend,thecontents ofthestateare returned astheciphertext. The codestarts outbyexpanding thekeyinto11arrays ofthe same size as the state. They are stored in rk, which is an array of structs, each containing a state array. One of these will be used at the start of the calculation and the other 10 will be used during the 10 rounds, one per round. The calculation of the round 786 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 keys from the encryption key is too complicated for us to get into here. Suffice it to say that the round keys are produced by repeated rotation and XORing of vari- ousgroupsofkeybits. Forallthedetails, see Daemen andRijmen (2002). The next step is to copy the plaintext into the state array so it can be proc- essed during the rounds. It is copied in column order, with the first 4 bytes going into column 0, the next 4bytes goinginto column 1, and soon. Both the columns and the rows are numbered starting at 0, although the rounds are numbered start- ing at 1. This initial setup of the 12 byte arrays of size 4×4 is illustrated in Fig.8-10. 128-Bitplaintext 128-Bitencryptionkey state rk[0] rk[1] rk[2] rk[3] rk[4] rk[5] rk[6] rk[7] rk[8] rk[9] rk[10] Roundkeys Figure8-10. Creatingthestateandrkarrays. There is one more step before the main computation begins: rk[0] is XORed into state, byte for byte. In other words, each of the 16 bytes in state is replaced bytheXORofitself andthecorrespondingbyteinrk[0]. Now it is time for the main attraction. The loop executes 10 iterations, one per round,transforming state oneachiteration. The contents ofeachroundispro- duced in four steps. Step 1 does a byte-for-byte substitution on state. Each byte inturnisused as an index intoan S-boxtoreplaceitsvalue bythecontents ofthat S-box entry. This step is a straight monoalphabetic substitution cipher. Unlike DES, whichhasmultipleS-boxes,Rijndael hasonlyoneS-box. Step 2 rotates each of the four rows to the left. Row 0 is rotated 0 bytes (i.e., notchanged), row 1isrotated 1byte, row 2isrotated 2bytes, androw3isrotated 3bytes. This step diffuses the contents of the current data around the block, anal- ogoustothepermutations ofFig.8-6. Step 3 mixes up each column independently of the other ones. The mixing is done using matrix multiplication in which the new column is the product of the old column and a constant matrix, with the multiplication done using the finite Galois field, GF(28). Although this may sound complicated, an algorithm exists that allows each element of the new column to be computed using two table look- upsandthree XORs(Daemen andRijmen, 2002,AppendixE). SEC', '8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 787 Finally, step 4 XORs the key for this round into the state array for use in the nextround. Since every step is reversible, decryption can be done just by running the al- gorithm backward. However, there is also a trick available in which decryption can bedonebyrunningtheencryption algorithm usingdifferent tables. The algorithm has been designed notonly for great security, but also for great speed. A good software implementation on a 2-GHz machine should be able to achieve an encryption rate of 700 Mbps, which is fast enough to encrypt over 100 MPEG-2 videosinreal time. Hardware implementations are faster still. 8.2.3 Cipher Modes Despite all thiscomplexity, AES (orDES, orany block cipher for that matter) is basically a monoalphabetic substitution cipher using big characters (128-bit characters for AES and 64-bit characters for DES). Whenever the same plaintext block goes in the front end, the same ciphertext block comes out the back end. If you encrypt the plaintext abcdefgh 100 times with the same DES key, you get the same ciphertext 100 times. An intruder can exploit this property to help subvert thecipher. Electronic Code BookMode To see how this monoalphabetic substitution cipher property can be used to partially defeat the cipher, we will use (triple) DES because it is easier to depict 64-bit blocks than 128-bit blocks, but AES has exactly the same problem. The straightforward way to use DES to encrypt a long piece of plaintext is to break it upintoconsecutive 8-byte (64-bit) blocks andencrypt them oneafter another with the same key. The last pieceofplaintext ispadded outto64bits, ifneed be. This technique isknownasECBmode (Electronic Code Bookmode)inanalogywith old-fashioned code books where each plaintext word was listed, followed by its ciphertext (usually afive-digit decimal number). In Fig.8-11, we have the start of a computer file listing the annual bonuses a company has decided to award to its employees. This file consists of consecutive 32-byte records, one per employee, in the format shown: 16 bytes for the name, 8 bytes for the position, and 8 bytes for the bonus. Each of the sixteen 8-byte blocks(numbered from0to15)isencrypted by(triple) DES. Leslie just had a fight with the boss and is not expecting much of a bonus. Kim,incontrast, istheboss’favorite, andeveryoneknowsthis. Leslie can getac- cess to the file after it is encrypted but before it is sent to the bank. Can Leslie rectify thisunfair situation, givenonlytheencrypted file? No problem at all. All Leslie has to do is make a copy of the 12th ciphertext block (which contains Kim’s bonus) and use it to replace the fourth ciphertext block (which contains Leslie’s bonus). Even without knowing what the 12th 788 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP', '8 Name Position Bonus A d a m s , L e s l i e C l e r k $ 1 0 B l a c k , R o b i n B o s s $ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 C o l l i n s , K i m M a n a g e r $ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 D a v i s , B o b b i e J a n i t o r $ 5 Bytes 16 8 8 Figure8-11.

(Copy- ing the eighth ciphertext block is also a possibility,butismore likely tobe detect- ed;besides, Leslie isnotagreedy person.) Cipher Block Chaining Mode To thwart this type of attack, all block ciphers can be chained in various ways so that replacing a block the way Leslie did will cause the plaintext decrypted starting at the replacedblock to be garbage. One way of chaining is cipher block chaining. Inthismethod,showninFig.8-12,eachplaintext blockisXORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. Consequently, the same plaintext block nolonger maps onto the same ciphertext block, and the encryption is no longer a big monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The first block is XORed witharandomlychosen IV(Initialization Vector),whichistransmitted(inplain- text) alongwiththeciphertext.

Then we compute 0 0 C =E(P XORC ), and so on. Decryption also uses XOR to reverse the proc- 1 1 0 ess, with P =IV XORD(C ), and so on. Note that the encryption of block i is a 0 0 SEC. 8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 789 function of all the plaintext inblocks 0through i −1, so the same plaintext gener- ates different ciphertext depending on where it occurs. A transformation of the type Leslie made will result in nonsense for two blocks starting at Leslie’s bonus field. To an astute security officer, this peculiarity might suggest where to start theensuing investigation. Cipher block chaining also has the advantage that the same plaintext block will not result in the same ciphertext block, making cryptanalysis more difficult. Infact, thisisthemainreason itisused. Cipher Feedback Mode However, cipher block chaining has the disadvantage of requiring an entire 64-bit block to arrive before decryption can begin. For byte-by-byte encryption, cipher feedback mode using (triple) DES is used, as shown in Fig.8-13. For AES, the idea is exactly the same, onlya 128-bit shift register is used. In this fig- ure, the state of the encryption machine is shown after bytes 0 through 9 have been encrypted and sent', 'When plaintext byte 10 arrives, as illustrated in Fig.8- 13(a), the DES algorithm operates on the 64-bit shift register to generate a 64-bit ciphertext. The leftmost byte of that ciphertext is extracted and XORed with P . 10 That byte is transmitted on the transmission line.

Cipherfeedbackmode.(a)Encryption.(b)Decryption. Note that the contents of the shift register depend on the entire previous his- tory of the plaintext, so a pattern that repeats multiple times in the plaintext will be encrypted differently each time in the ciphertext. As with cipher block chain- ing,aninitializationvector isneeded tostart theballrolling. 790 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 Decryption with cipher feedback mode works the same way as encryption. In particular, the content of the shift register is encrypted, not decrypted, so the se- lected byte that is XORed with C to get P is the same one that was XORed 10 10 with P to generate C in the first place. As long as the two shift registers 10 10 remain identical, decryption workscorrectly. ThisisillustratedinFig.8-13(b). A problem with cipher feedback mode is that if one bit of the ciphertext is ac- cidentally inverted during transmission, the 8 bytes that are decrypted while the bad byte is in the shift register will be corrupted. Once the bad byte is pushed out of the shift register, correct plaintext will once again be generated. Thus, the ef- fects of a single inverted bit are relatively localized and do not ruin the rest of the message, buttheydoruinasmanybitsastheshiftregister iswide. Stream Cipher Mode Nevertheless, applications exist in which having a 1-bit transmission error mess up 64 bits of plaintext is too large an effect. For these applications, a fourth option, stream cipher mode, exists. It works by encrypting an initialization vec- tor, using a key to get an output block. The output block is then encrypted, using the key to get a second output block. This block is then encrypted to get a third block, and so on. The (arbitrarily large) sequence of output blocks, called the keystream, is treated like a one-time pad and XORed with the plaintext toget the ciphertext, as shown in Fig.8-14(a). Note that the IV is used only on the first step. After that, the output is encrypted. Also note that the keystream is indepen- dent of the data, so it can be computed in advance, if need be, and is completely insensitivetotransmission errors. Decryption isshowninFig. 8-14(b). IV IV Encryptionbox Encryptionbox Key E Key E Keystream Keystream Plaintext + Ciphertext Ciphertext + Plaintext (a) (b) Figure8-14. Astreamcipher.(a)Encryption.(b)Decryption', 'Decryption occurs by generating the same keystream at the receiving side. Since the keystream depends only on the IV and the key, it is not affected by transmission errors in the ciphertext. Thus, a 1-bit error in the transmitted cipher- textgenerates onlya1-biterrorinthedecrypted plaintext. SEC. 8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 791 It is essential never to use the same (key, IV) pair twice with a stream cipher because doing so will generate the same keystream each time. Using the same keystream twice exposes the ciphertext to a keystream reuse attack. Imagine that the plaintext block, P , is encrypted with the keystream to get P XORK . 0 0 0 Later, a second plaintext block, Q , is encrypted with the same keystream to get 0 Q XORK . An intruder who captures both of these ciphertext blocks can sim- 0 0 plyXOR themtogether toget P XORQ ,which eliminates the key. The intrud- 0 0 er now has the XOR of the two plaintext blocks. If one of them is known or can be guessed, the other can also be found. In any event, the XOR of two plaintext streams can be attacked by using statistical properties of the message. For ex- ample, forEnglish text,themostcommon character inthe stream willprobably be the XOR of two spaces, followed by the XOR of space and the letter ‘‘e’’, etc. In short, equipped with the XOR of two plaintexts, the cryptanalyst has an excellent chance ofdeducing bothofthem. Counter Mode Oneproblem that all the modes except electronic code bookmode have isthat random access to encrypted data is impossible. For example, suppose a file is transmitted over a network and then stored on disk in encrypted form. This might be a reasonable way to operate if the receiving computer is a notebook computer that might be stolen. Storing all critical files in encrypted form greatly reduces the damage due to secret information leaking out in the event that the computer falls intothewronghands. However, disk files are often accessed in nonsequential order, especially files in databases. With a file encrypted using cipher block chaining, accessing a ran- dom block requires first decrypting all the blocks ahead of it, an expensive proposition. For this reason, yet another mode has been invented: counter mode, as illustrated in Fig. 8-15. Here, the plaintext is not encrypted directly. Instead, the initializationvector plusa constant isencrypted, andthe resultingciphertext is XORed with the plaintext. By stepping the initialization vector by1for each new block, it is easy to decrypt a block anywhere in the file without first having to de- crypt allofitspredecessors. Althoughcounter mode is useful, it has a weakness that is worth pointing out. Suppose that the same key, K, is used again in the future (with a different plain- text but the same IV) and an attacker acquires all the ciphertext from both runs. The keystreams are the same in both cases, exposing the cipher to a keystream reuse attack of the same kind we saw with stream ciphers', 'All the cryptanalyst has to do is XOR the two ciphertexts together to eliminate all the cryptographic protection and just get the XOR of the plaintexts. This weakness does not mean counter mode is a bad idea. It just means that both keys and initialization vectors should be chosen independently and at random. Even if the same key is accide- ntally usedtwice, iftheIVisdifferent eachtime, theplaintext issafe. 792 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 IV IV+1 IV+2 IV+3 Key E Key E Key E Key E Encryption box P 0 + P 1 + P 2 + P 3 + C 0 C 1 C 2 C 3 Figure8-15.

(No one will blame you if you use AES in your product and AES is cracked, but they will certainly blame you if you use a nonstandard cipher and it is later broken.) How- ever, itisworth mentioning that numerous other symmetric-key ciphers have been devised. Some ofthese are embedded inside various products. Afew ofthe more common ones are listed in Fig. 8-16. It is possible to use combinations of these ciphers, for example, AES over Twofish, sothat bothciphers need tobebroken to recover thedata.

Somecommonsymmetric-keycryptographicalgorithms. 8.2.5 Cryptanalysis Before leaving the subject of symmetric-key cryptography, it is worth at least mentioning four developments in cryptanalysis. The first development is dif- ferential cryptanalysis (Biham and Shamir, 1997). This technique can be used SEC. 8.2 SYMMETRIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 793 to attack any block cipher. It works by beginning with a pair of plaintext blocks differing in only a small number of bits and watching carefully what happens on each internal iteration as the encryption proceeds. In many cases, some bit pat- ternsare more commonthanothers, whichcan lead toprobabilisticattacks. The seconddevelopment worth noting islinear cryptanalysis (Matsui, 1994). It can break DES with only 243 known plaintexts. It works by XORing certain bits in the plaintext and ciphertext together and examining the result. When done repeatedly, half the bits should be 0s and half should be 1s. Often, however, ciphers introduceabias inonedirection orthe other, andthis bias, however small, can beexploited toreduce theworkfactor. Forthedetails, see Matsui’s paper. The third development is using analysis of electrical power consumption to find secret keys. Computers typically use around 3voltstorepresent a 1bit and0 volts to represent a 0 bit. Thus, processing a 1 takes more electrical energy than processing a 0. If a cryptographic algorithm consists of a loop in which the key bits are processed in order, an attacker who replaces the main n-GHz clock with a slow (e.g., 100-Hz) clock and puts alligator clips on the CPU’s power and ground pins can precisely monitor the power consumed by each machine instruction. From this data, deducing the key is surprisingly easy', 'This kind of cryptanalysis can be defeated only by carefully coding the algorithm in assembly language to make sure power consumption is independent of the key and also independent of alltheindividual roundkeys. The fourth development is timing analysis. Cryptographic algorithms are full of if statements that test bits in the round keys. If the then and else parts take dif- ferent amounts of time, by slowing down the clock and seeing how long various steps take, it may also be possible to deduce the round keys. Once all the round keys are known, the original key can usually be computed. Power and timing analysis can also be employed simultaneously tomake the jobeasier. While pow- er and timing analysis may seem exotic, in reality they are powerful techniques thatcan break anycipher notspecifically designed toresist them. 8.3 PUBLIC-KEY ALGORITHMS Historically, distributing the keys has always been the weakest link in most cryptosystems. No matter how strong a cryptosystem was, if an intruder could steal the key, the system was worthless. Cryptologists always took for granted that the encryption key and decryption key were the same (or easily derived from oneanother). But the key had tobe distributed toall users of the system. Thus, it seemed as if there was an inherent problem. Keys had to be protected from theft, buttheyalsohadtobedistributed, sotheycouldnotbelocked inabankvault. In 1976, two researchers at Stanford University, Diffie and Hellman (1976), proposed a radically new kind of cryptosystem, one in which the encryption and decryption keys were so different that the decryption key could not feasibly be 794 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 derived from the encryption key. In their proposal, the (keyed) encryption algo- rithm, E,andthe(keyed) decryption algorithm, D,hadtomeet three requirements. These requirements can bestated simplyasfollows: 1. D(E(P))=P. 2. Itisexceedinglydifficult todeduce DfromE. 3. Ecannotbebrokenbyachosen plaintext attack. The first requirement says that if we apply D to an encrypted message, E(P), we get the original plaintext message, P, back. Without this property, the legitimate receiver could not decrypt the ciphertext. The second requirement speaks for it- self. The third requirement is needed because, as we shall see in a moment, in- truders may experiment with the algorithm to their hearts’ content. Under these conditions,there isnoreason thattheencryption keycannotbemade public. The methodworkslikethis. Aperson,say, Alice, whowants toreceive secret messages, first devises two algorithms meeting the above requirements. The en- cryption algorithm and Alice’s key are then made public, hence the name public- key cryptography. Alice might put her public key on her home page on the Web, for example. We will use the notation E to mean the encryption algorithm A parameterized by Alice’s public key. Similarly, the (secret) decryption algorithm parameterized byAlice’s private key is D . Bob does the same thing, publicizing A E butkeeping D secret. B B Now let us see if we can solve the problem of establishing a secure channel between Alice and Bob, who have never had any previous contact. Both Alice’s encryption key, E , and Bob’s encryption key, E , are assumed to be in publicly A B readable files', 'Now Alice takes her first message, P, computes E (P), and sends B it to Bob. Bob then decrypts it by applying his secret key D [i.e., he computes B D (E (P))=P]. No one else can read the encrypted message, E (P), because B B B the encryption system is assumed to be strong and because it is too difficult to derive D from the publicly known E . To send a reply, R, Bob transmits E (R). B B A Alice andBobcan nowcommunicate securely. A note on terminology is perhaps useful here. Public-key cryptography re- quires each user to have two keys: a public key, used by the entire world for en- crypting messages to be sent to that user, and a private key, which the user needs for decrypting messages. We will consistently refer to these keys as the public and private keys, respectively, and distinguish them from the secret keys used for conventionalsymmetric-key cryptography. 8.3.1 RSA The only catch is that we need to find algorithms that indeed satisfy all three requirements. Due to the potential advantages of public-key cryptography, many researchers are hard at work, and some algorithms have already been published. SEC. 8.3 PUBLIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 795 One good method was discovered by a group at M.I.T. (Rivest et al., 1978). It is knownbythe initialsofthe three discoverers (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman): RSA. It has survived all attempts to break it for more than 30years and is considered very strong. Much practical security is based on it. For this reason, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman were given the 2002ACMTuring Award. Itsmajor disadvantage is that it requires keys of at least 1024 bits for good security (versus 128 bits for symmetric-key algorithms), whichmakes itquiteslow. The RSA method is based on some principles from number theory. We will nowsummarize howtousethemethod;fordetails, consultthepaper. 1. Choosetwolarge primes, pandq(typically 1024bits). 2. Compute n =p ×qandz =(p −1)×(q −1). 3. Chooseanumberrelatively prime tozandcall itd. 4. Findesuchthate ×d =1mod z. With these parameters computed in advance, we are ready to begin encryption. Divide the plaintext (regarded as a bit string) into blocks, so that each plaintext message, P, falls in the interval 0≤P <n. Do that by grouping the plaintext into blocksofkbits,where kisthelargest integer forwhich 2k <nistrue. To encrypt a message, P, compute C =Pe (mod n). To decrypt C, compute P =Cd (mod n). It can be proven that for all P in the specified range, the en- cryption and decryption functions are inverses. To perform the encryption, you need e and n. To perform the decryption, youneed dandn. Therefore, the public keyconsists ofthepair(e, n)andtheprivate keyconsists of(d, n). The security of the method is based on the difficulty of factoring large num- bers. If the cryptanalyst could factor the (publicly known) n, he could then find p and q, and from these z. Equipped with knowledge of z and e, d can be found using Euclid’s algorithm. Fortunately, mathematicians have been trying to factor large numbersforatleast 300years, andtheaccumulatedevidence suggeststhat it isanexceedinglydifficult problem. According to Rivest and colleagues, factoring a 500-digit number would re- quire 1025 years usingbrute force', \"Inbothcases, theyassumed thebest knownal- gorithm and a computer with a 1-μsec instruction time. With a million chips run- ning in parallel, each with an instruction time of 1 nsec, it would still take 1016 years. Even if computers continue to get faster by an order of magnitude per decade, it will be many years before factoring a 500-digit number becomes feasi- ble,atwhichtime ourdescendants cansimplychoosepandqstilllarger. A trivial pedagogical example of how the RSA algorithm works is given in Fig.8-17. For this example, we have chosen p =3 and q =11, giving n =33 and z =20. A suitable value for d is d =7, since 7 and 20 have no common factors. With these choices, e can be found by solving the equation 7e =1 (mod20), which yields e =3. The ciphertext, C, correspondingtoaplaintext message, P, is 796 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 given by C =P3 (mod33). The ciphertext is decrypted by the receiver by mak- ing use of the rule P =C7 (mod33). The figure shows the encryption of the plaintext ‘‘SUZANNE’’asanexample.

AnexampleoftheRSAalgorithm. Because the primes chosen for this example are so small, P must be less than 33, so each plaintext block can contain only a single character. The result is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, not very impressive. If instead we had cho- sen p and q ∼∼2512, we would have n ∼∼21024, so each block could be up to 1024 bits or 128 eight-bit characters, versus 8 characters for DES and 16 characters for AES. It should be pointed out that using RSA as we have described is similar to using a symmetric algorithm in ECB mode—the same input block gives the same output block. Therefore, some form of chaining is needed for data encryption. However, in practice, most RSA-based systems use public-key cryptography pri- marily for distributing one-time session keys for use with some symmetric-key al- gorithm such as AES ortriple DES. RSA istooslow foractually encrypting large volumes ofdata butiswidely usedforkeydistribution. 8.3.2 Other Public-Key Algorithms AlthoughRSAiswidely used, itisbynomeans the onlypublic-keyalgorithm known. The first public-key algorithm was the knapsack algorithm (Merkle and Hellman, 1978). The idea here is that someone owns a large number of objects, each with a different weight. The owner encodes the message by secretly select- ing a subset of the objects and placing them in the knapsack. The total weight of the objects in the knapsack is made public, as is the list of all possible objects and their corresponding weights. The list of objects in the knapsack is kept secret. With certain additional restrictions, the problem of figuring out a possible list of objects with the given weight was thought to be computationally infeasible and formed thebasisofthepublic-keyalgorithm. SEC\", '8.3 PUBLIC-KEY ALGORITHMS 797 The algorithm’s inventor, Ralph Merkle, was quite sure that this algorithm could not be broken, so he offered a $100 reward to anyone who could break it. Adi Shamir (the ‘‘S’’ in RSA) promptly broke it and collected the reward. Undeterred, Merkle strengthened the algorithm and offered a $1000 reward to anyone who could break the new one. Ronald Rivest (the ‘‘R’’ in RSA) promptly broke the new one and collected the reward. Merkle did not dare offer $10,000 for the next version, so ‘‘A’’ (Leonard Adleman) was out of luck. Nevertheless, the knapsack algorithm is not considered secure and is not used in practice any more. Other public-key schemes are based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. Algorithms that use this principle have been invented by El Gamal (1985)andSchnorr(1991). A few other schemes exist, such as those based on elliptic curves (Menezes and Vanstone, 1993), but the two major categories are those based on the diffi- culty of factoring large numbers and computing discrete logarithms modulo a large prime. These problems are thought to be genuinely difficult to solve— mathematicians have been working on them for many years without any great breakthroughs. 8.4 DIGITAL SIGNATURES The authenticity of many legal, financial, and other documents is determined by the presence or absence of an authorized handwritten signature. And photocopies do not count. For computerized message systems to replace the physical transport of paper-and-ink documents, a method must be found to allow documents tobesignedinanunforgeable way. The problem of devising a replacement for handwritten signatures is a diffi- cult one. Basically, what is needed is a system by which one party can send a signedmessage toanother party insuchawaythatthefollowing conditionshold: 1. The receivercan verify theclaimed identityofthesender. 2. The sender cannotlater repudiatethe contents ofthemessage. 3. The receivercannotpossiblyhave concocted themessage himself. The first requirement is needed, for example, in financial systems. When a customer’s computer orders a bank’s computer to buy a ton of gold, the bank’s computer needs to be able to make sure that the computer giving the order really belongs to the customer whose account is to be debited. In other words, the bank hastoauthenticate thecustomer (andthecustomer hastoauthenticate thebank). The second requirement is needed to protect the bank against fraud. Suppose that the bank buys the ton of gold, and immediately thereafter the price of gold 798 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 dropssharply. Adishonestcustomer mightthenproceedtosuethebank, claiming that he never issued any order to buy gold. When the bank produces the message in court, the customer may deny having sent it. The property that no party to a contract can later denyhavingsigned itiscalled nonrepudiation. Thedigital sig- nature schemes thatwewillnowstudyhelpprovide it. The third requirement is needed to protect the customer in the event that the price of gold shoots up and the bank tries to construct a signed message in which the customer asked for one bar of gold instead of one ton. In this fraud scenario, thebankjustkeeps therestofthegoldforitself', '8.4.1 Symmetric-Key Signatures One approach to digital signatures is to have a central authority that knows everything and whom everyone trusts, say, Big Brother (BB). Each user then chooses a secret key and carries it by hand to BB’s office. Thus, only Alice and BBknowAlice’s secret key,K ,andsoon. A When Alice wants to send a signed plaintext message, P, to her banker, Bob, she generates K (B, R , t, P), where B is Bob’s identity, R is a random number A A A chosen by Alice, t is a timestamp to ensure freshness, and K (B, R , t, P) is the A A message encrypted with her key, K . Then she sends it as depicted in Fig.8-18. A BBsees thatthemessage isfromAlice, decrypts it,andsendsamessage toBobas shown. The message to Bob contains the plaintext of Alice’s message and also thesigned message K (A, t, P). Bobnowcarries outAlice’s request. BB A,K (B,R ,t,P) A A ecilA BB boB 1 2 K (A,R ,t,P,K (A,t,P)) B A BB Figure8-18. DigitalsignatureswithBigBrother. What happens ifAlice later denies sending the message? Step 1is that every- onesues everyone(at least, intheUnited States). Finally, whenthecase comes to court and Alice vigorously denies sending Bob the disputed message, the judge will ask Bob how he can be sure that the disputed message came from Alice and notfromTrudy. Bobfirstpointsoutthat BB willnotaccepta message fromAlice unless it is encrypted with K , so there is no possibility of Trudy sending BB a A false message fromAlice withoutBBdetecting itimmediately. Bobthen dramatically produces Exhibit A: K (A, t, P). Bob says that this is BB a message signed by BB that proves Alice sent P to Bob. The judge then asks BB (whom everyone trusts) to decrypt Exhibit A. When BB testifies that Bob is tel- lingthetruth,thejudgedecides infavorofBob. Case dismissed. SEC. 8.4 DIGITAL SIGNATURES 799 One potential problem with the signature protocol of Fig.8-18 is Trudy re- playing either message. To minimize this problem, timestamps are used through- out. Furthermore, Bobcan check all recentmessages tosee if R was used inany A of them. If so, the message is discarded as a replay. Note that based on the time- stamp, Bobwillreject very oldmessages. To guard against instant replay attacks, Bob just checks the R of every incoming message to see if such a message has A been received from Alice in the past hour. If not, Bob can safely assume this is a newrequest. 8.4.2 Public-Key Signatures A structural problem with using symmetric-key cryptography for digital sig- natures is that everyone has to agree to trust Big Brother. Furthermore, Big Brother gets toread all signed messages. The most logical candidates for running the Big Brother server are the government, the banks, the accountants, and the lawyers. Unfortunately, none of these inspire total confidence in all citizens. Hence, itwouldbenice ifsigningdocuments didnotrequire atrusted authority. Fortunately, public-key cryptography can make an important contribution in this area. Let us assume that the public-key encryption and decryption algorithms have the property that E(D(P))=P, in addition, of course, to the usual property that D(E(P))=P', \"(RSA has this property, so the assumption is not unrea- sonable.) Assuming that this is the case, Alice can send a signed plaintext mes- sage, P, to Bob by transmitting E (D (P)). Note carefully that Alice knows her B A own (private) key, D , as well as Bob’s public key, E , so constructing this mes- A B sage issomething Alice can do. When Bob receives the message, he transforms it using his private key, as usual, yielding D (P), as shown in Fig.8-19. He stores this text in a safe place A andthenapplies E togettheoriginal plaintext.

Digitalsignaturesusingpublic-keycryptography. To see how the signature property works, suppose that Alice subsequently denies having sent the message P to Bob. When the case comes up in court, Bob can producebothPand D (P). The judgecan easily verify that Bob indeed has a A valid message encrypted by D by simply applying E to it. Since Bob does not A A 800 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 know what Alice’s private key is, the only way Bob could have acquired a mes- sage encrypted by it is if Alice did indeed send it. While in jail for perjury and fraud, Alice willhavemuchtimetodevise interesting newpublic-keyalgorithms. Although using public-key cryptography for digital signatures is an elegant scheme, there are problems thatare related totheenvironment inwhichtheyoper- ate rather than to the basic algorithm. For one thing, Bob can prove that a mes- sage was sent by Alice only as long as D remains secret. If Alice discloses her A secret key, the argument no longer holds, because anyone could have sent the message, includingBobhimself. The problem might arise, forexample, ifBobisAlice’s stockbroker. Suppose that Alice tells Bob to buy a certain stock or bond. Immediately thereafter, the price drops sharply. To repudiate her message to Bob, Alice runs to the police claiming that her home was burglarized and the PC holding her key was stolen. Depending on the laws in her state or country, she may or may not be legally liable, especially if she claims not to have discovered the break-in until getting homefromwork,several hoursafter itallegedly happened. Another problem with the signature scheme is what happens if Alice decides to change her key. Doing so is clearly legal, and it is probably a good idea to do so periodically. If a court case later arises, as described above, the judge will apply the current E to D (P) and discover that it does not produce P. Bob will A A lookpretty stupidatthispoint. In principle, any public-key algorithm can be used for digital signatures. The de facto industry standard is the RSA algorithm. Many security products use it. However, in 1991, NIST proposed using a variant of the El Gamal public-key al- gorithm for its new Digital Signature Standard (DSS)\", 'El Gamal gets itssecuri- ty from the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms, rather than from the diffi- cultyoffactoring large numbers. As usual when the government tries to dictate cryptographic standards, there was anuproar. DSS was criticizedforbeing 1. Toosecret (NSA designed theprotocol forusingElGamal). 2. Tooslow(10to40times slower thanRSA forchecking signatures). 3. Toonew(ElGamal hadnotyetbeen thoroughlyanalyzed). 4. Tooinsecure (fixed 512-bitkey). In a subsequent revision, the fourth point was rendered moot when keys up to 1024bitswere allowed. Nevertheless, thefirsttwopointsremain valid. 8.4.3 Message Digests One criticism of signature methods is that they often couple two distinct func- tions: authentication and secrecy. Often, authentication is needed but secrecy is not always needed. Also, getting an export license is often easier if the system in SEC. 8.4 DIGITAL SIGNATURES 801 question provides only authentication but not secrecy. Below we will describe an authentication scheme thatdoesnotrequire encrypting theentire message. This scheme is based on the idea of a one-way hash function that takes an arbitrarily long piece of plaintext and from it computes a fixed-length bit string. Thishash function, MD,often called amessage digest,has fourimportant proper- ties: 1. GivenP,itiseasy tocompute MD(P). 2. GivenMD(P),itiseffectively impossible tofindP. 3. GivenP,noonecan findP′suchthatMD(P′)=MD(P). 4. Achange totheinputofeven 1bitproducesaverydifferent output. Tomeet criterion 3,the hash shouldbeat least 128bitslong,preferably more. To meet criterion 4, the hash must mangle the bits very thoroughly, not unlike the symmetric-key encryption algorithms wehaveseen. Computing a message digest from a piece of plaintext is much faster than en- crypting that plaintext with a public-key algorithm, so message digests can be usedtospeed updigital signature algorithms. Tosee howthisworks, consider the signature protocol of Fig.8-18 again. Instead, of signing P with K (A, t, P), BB BB now computes the message digest by applying MD to P, yielding MD(P). BB then encloses K (A, t, MD(P))as the fifth item inthe list encrypted withK that BB B issenttoBob,instead ofK (A, t, P). BB If a dispute arises, Bob can produce both P and K (A, t, MD(P)). After Big BB Brother has decrypted it for the judge, Bob has MD(P), which is guaranteed tobe genuine, and the alleged P. However, since it is effectively impossible for Bob to findany othermessage thatgivesthishash, thejudgewilleasily beconvincedthat Bob is telling the truth. Using message digests in this way saves both encryption time andmessage transport costs. Message digests work in public-key cryptosystems, too, as shown in Fig.8- 20. Here, Alice first computes the message digest ofherplaintext. Shethensigns the message digest and sends both the signed digest and the plaintext to Bob. If TrudyreplacesPalongtheway,Bobwillsee thiswhenhecomputes MD(P). P,D (MD(P)) A ecilA boB Figure8-20. Digitalsignaturesusingmessagedigests. 802 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 SHA-1 andSHA-2 A variety of message digest functions have been proposed. One of the most widely used functions is SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) (NIST, 1993). Like all message digests, it operates bymangling bits ina sufficiently complicated way that every outputbitisaffected byevery inputbit. SHA-1 was developed byNSA andblessed byNIST inFIPS 180-1. It processes inputdata in 512-bitblocks, and it generates a 160-bitmessage digest. A typical way for Alice to send a nonsecret but signed message to Bob is illustrated in Fig.8-21', \"Here, her plaintext message is fed into the SHA-1 algorithm to get a160-bitSHA-1 hash. Alice then signs the hash with her RSA private key and sends both the plaintext message and the signedhashtoBob. Alice's privatekey,D A Alice's plaintext 160-BitSHA-1 message hashofM Signedhash M SHA-1 RSA H D (H) (arbitrary algorithm algorithm A Sent length) to Bob Figure8-21. UseofSHA-1andRSAforsigningnonsecretmessages. After receiving the message, Bob computes the SHA-1 hash himself and also applies Alice’s public key to the signed hash to get the original hash, H. If the two agree, the message is considered valid. Since there is no way for Trudy to modify the (plaintext) message while it is in transit and produce a new one that hashes to H, Bob can easily detect any changes Trudy has made to the message. For messages whose integrity is important but whose contents are not secret, the scheme of Fig. 8-21 is widely used. For a relatively small cost in computation, it guarantees that any modifications made to the plaintext message in transit can be detected withveryhighprobability. Now let us briefly see how SHA-1 works. It starts out by padding the mes- sage byadding a 1bit to the end, followed byas many 0bits as are necessary, but at least 64, to make the length a multiple of 512 bits. Then a 64-bit number con- taining the message length before padding is ORed into the low-order 64 bits. In Fig.8-22, the message is shown with padding on the right because English text and figures go from left to right (i.e., the lower right is generally perceived as the end of the figure). With computers, this orientation corresponds to big-endian machines such as the SPARC and the IBM 360 and its successors, but SHA-1 al- ways padstheendofthemessage, nomatter which endian machine isused.

(a)Amessagepaddedouttoamultipleof512bits.(b)Theoutput variables. (c)Thewordarray. During the computation, SHA-1 maintains five 32-bit variables, H through 0 H , where the hash accumulates. These are shown in Fig.8-22(b). They are ini- 4 tialized toconstants specified inthestandard. Each of the blocks M 0 through M n−1 is now processed in turn. For the cur- rent block, the 16 words are first copied into the start of an auxiliary 80-word array, W, as shown in Fig. 8-22(c). Then the other 64 words in W are filled in usingtheformula W i =S1(W i−3 XOR W i−8 XOR W i−14 XOR W i−16 ) (16≤i ≤79) where Sb(W) represents the left circular rotation of the 32-bit word, W, by b bits. Now five scratch variables, A through E, are initialized from H through H , re- 0 4 spectively. The actual calculation can beexpressed inpseudo-Cas for(i=0;i<80;i++) { temp=S5(A)+f (B,C,D)+E+W +K; i i i E=D; D=C; C=S30(B); B=A; A=temp; } where the K constants are defined in the standard\", 'The mixing functions f are i i defined as f (B,C,D)=(B ANDC)OR(NOT B ANDD) ( 0≤i≤19) i f (B,C,D)=B XORC XORD (20≤i≤39) i f (B,C,D)=(B ANDC)OR(B ANDD)OR(C ANDD) (40≤i≤59) i f (B,C,D)=B XORC XORD (60≤i≤79) i When all80iterations ofthe loopare completed, A throughEare added toH 0 throughH ,respectively. 4 Now that the first 512-bit block has been processed, the next one is started. The W array is reinitialized from the new block, butH is left as it was. When this 804 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 block is finished, the next one is started, and so on, until all the 512-bit message blocks have been tossed into the soup. When the last block has been finished, the five 32-bit words inthe H array are output as the 160-bitcryptographic hash. The complete Ccode forSHA-1 isgiveninRFC 3174. New versions of SHA-1 have been developed that produce hashes of 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits. Collectively, these versions are called SHA-2. Not only are these hashes longer than SHA-1 hashes, but the digest function has been changed tocombat some potential weaknesses ofSHA-1. SHA-2 isnotyetwidely used,butitislikely tobeinthefuture. MD5 For completeness, we will mention another digest that is popular. MD5 (Rivest, 1992) is the fifth in a series of message digests designed by Ronald Rivest. Very briefly, the message is padded toa length of 448bits (modulo512). Then the original length of the message is appended as a 64-bit integer to give a total input whose length is a multiple of 512 bits. Each round of the computation takes a 512-bitblock ofinputand mixes it thoroughlywitha running128-bitbuff- er. For good measure, the mixing uses a table constructed from the sine function. The point of using a known function is to avoid any suspicion that the designer built in a clever back door through which only he can enter. This process con- tinues until all the input blocks have been consumed. The contents of the 128-bit bufferformthemessage digest. After more than adecadeofsoliduse and study,weaknesses in MD5 have led to the ability to find collisions, or different messages with the same hash (Sotirov, etal., 2008). Thisisthedeath knellforadigest function because itmeans that the digest cannot safely be used to represent a message. Thus, the security commun- ity considers MD5 to be broken; it should be replaced where possible and no new systems shoulduse it as part oftheir design. Nevertheless, youmay stillsee MD5 usedinexisting systems. 8.4.4 The Birthday Attack In the world of crypto, nothing is ever what it seems to be. One might think that it would take on the order of 2m operations to subvert an m-bit message dig- est. In fact, 2m/2 operations will often do using the birthday attack, an approach publishedbyYuval(1979)inhisnow-classic paper ‘‘HowtoSwindle Rabin.’’ The idea forthis attack comes from atechnique that math professors often use in their probability courses. The question is: how many students do you need in a class before the probability of having two people with the same birthday exceeds 1/2? Most students expect the answer to be way over 100. In fact, probability theory says it is just 23', 'Without giving a rigorous analysis, intuitively, with 23 SEC. 8.4 DIGITAL SIGNATURES 805 people, we can form (23×22)/2=253 different pairs, each of which has a probability of 1/365 of being a hit. In this light, it is not really so surprising any more. More generally, if there is some mapping between inputs and outputs with n inputs (people, messages, etc.) and k possible outputs (birthdays, message digests, etc.), there are n(n −1)/2 input pairs. If n(n −1)/2>k, the chance of having at least one match is pretty good. Thus, approximately, a match islikely forn >√ k. This result means that a 64-bit message digest can probably be broken bygenerat- ingabout232 messages andlookingfortwowiththesame message digest. Let us look at a practical example. The Department of Computer Science at State University has one position for a tenured faculty member and two candi- dates, Tom and Dick. Tom was hired two years before Dick, so he goes up for review first. If he gets it, Dick is out of luck. Tom knows that the department chairperson, Marilyn, thinks highly of his work, so he asks her to write him a letter ofrecommendation tothe Dean, whowilldecide onTom’s case. Once sent, allletters become confidential. Marilyn tells her secretary, Ellen, to write the Dean a letter, outlining what she wants in it. When it is ready, Marilyn will review it, compute and sign the 64-bitdigest, andsendittotheDean. Ellen can sendtheletter later byemail.

After getting the letter and signed message digest, the Dean runs the message digest algorithm on letter B, sees that it agrees with what Marilyn sent him, and fires Tom. The Dean does not realize that Ellen managed to generate two letters with the same message digest and sent her a different one than the one Marilyn saw and approved. (Optional ending: Ellen tells Dick what she did. Dick is appalled and breaks off the affair. Ellen is furious and confesses to Marilyn. Marilyn calls the Dean. Tom gets tenure after all.) With SHA-1, the birthday at- tack is difficult because even at the ridiculous speed of 1 trillion digests per sec- ond, it would take over 32,000 years to compute all 280 digests of two letters with 80 variants each, and even then a match is not guaranteed. With a cloud of 1,000,000chips workinginparallel, 32,000years becomes 2weeks. 8.5 MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC KEYS Public-key cryptography makes it possible for people who do not share a common key in advance to nevertheless communicate securely. It also makes signing messages possible without the presence of a trusted third party. Finally, SEC. 8.5 MANAGEMENTOFPUBLICKEYS 807 signed message digests make it possible for the recipient to verify the integrity of receivedmessages easily andsecurely. However, there is one problem that we have glossed over a bit too quickly: if Alice and Bob do not know each other, how do they get each other’s public keys to start the communication process? The obvious solution—put your public key on your Web site—does not work, for the following reason. Suppose that Alice wants to look up Bob’s public key on his Web site. How does she do it? She starts by typing in Bob’s URL. Her browser then looks up the DNS address of Bob’shomepageandsends it aGET request, as showninFig.8-23', \"Unfortunate- ly, Trudy intercepts the request and replies with a fake home page, probably a copy of Bob’s home page except for the replacement of Bob’s public key with Trudy’s public key. When Alice now encrypts her first message with E , Trudy T decrypts it, reads it, re-encrypts itwith Bob’s publickey, and sends itto Bob, who is none the wiser that Trudy is reading his incoming messages. Worse yet, Trudy could modify the messages before reencrypting them for Bob. Clearly, some mechanism isneeded tomake surethatpublickeyscanbeexchanged securely. 1.GETBob'shomepage 2.FakehomepagewithE T Alice Trudy Bob 3.E (Message) T 4.E (Message) B Figure8-23. AwayforTrudytosubvertpublic-keyencryption. 8.5.1 Certificates As a first attempt at distributing public keys securely, we could imagine a KDC key distribution center available online 24 hours a day to provide public keys on demand. One of the many problems with this solution is that it is not scalable, and the key distribution center would rapidly become a bottleneck. Also,ifitever wentdown,Internet security wouldsuddenlygrindtoahalt. For these reasons, people have developed a different solution, one that does not require the key distribution center to be online all the time. Infact, itdoes not have to be online at all. Instead, what it does is certify the public keys belonging to people, companies, and other organizations. An organization that certifies pub- lickeysisnowcalled aCA(Certification Authority). As an example, suppose that Bob wants to allow Alice and other people he does not know to communicate with him securely. He can go to the CA with his public key along with his passport or driver’s license and ask to be certified. The CA then issues a certificate similar to the one in Fig.8-24 and signs its SHA-1 808 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 hash with the CA’s private key. Bob then pays the CA’s fee and gets a CD-ROM containing thecertificate anditssignedhash. Iherebycertifythatthepublickey 19836A8B03030CF83737E3837837FC3s87092827262643FFA82710382828282A belongsto RobertJohnSmith 12345UniversityAvenue Berkeley,CA94702 Birthday:July4,1958 Email:bob@superdupernet.com SHA-1hashoftheabovecertificatesignedwiththeCA’sprivatekey Figure8-24. Apossiblecertificate anditssignedhash. The fundamental job of a certificate is to bind a public key to the name of a principal (individual, company, etc.). Certificates themselves are not secret or protected. Bob might, for example, decide to put his new certificate on his Web site, with a link onthe main page saying: Click here for my public-keycertificate. The resulting click would return both the certificate and the signature block (the signedSHA-1 hashofthecertificate). Now let us run through the scenario of Fig.8-23 again. When Trudy inter- cepts Alice’s request forBob’shomepage, whatcan shedo? Shecan putherown certificate andsignature blockonthefake page, butwhen Alice reads the contents of the certificate she will immediately see that she is not talking to Bob because Bob’s name is not in it. Trudy can modify Bob’s home page on the fly, replacing Bob’s public key with her own. However, when Alice runs the SHA-1 algorithm on the certificate, she will get a hash that does not agree with the one she gets when she applies the CA’s well-known public key to the signature block\", 'Since Trudy does not have the CA’s private key, she has no way of generating a signa- ture block that contains the hash of the modified Web page with her publickeyon it. In this way, Alice can be sure she has Bob’s public key and not Trudy’s or someone else’s. And as we promised, this scheme does not require the CA to be onlineforverification, thuseliminating apotential bottleneck. While the standard function of a certificate is to bind a public key to a princi- pal, a certificate can also be used to bind a public key to an attribute. For ex- ample, a certificate could say: ‘‘This public key belongs to someone over 18.’’ It could be used to prove that the owner of the private key was not a minor and thus allowed to access material not suitable for children, and so on, but without dis- closing the owner’s identity. Typically, the person holding the certificate would send it to the Web site, principal, or process that cared about age. That site, prin- cipal, or process would then generate a random number and encrypt it with the publickeyinthe certificate. If the owner were able todecrypt it and send it back, SEC. 8.5 MANAGEMENTOFPUBLICKEYS 809 that would be proof that the owner indeed had the attribute stated in the certifi- cate. Alternatively, the random number could be used to generate a session key fortheensuingconversation. Another example of where a certificate might contain an attribute is in an ob- ject-oriented distributed system. Each object normally hasmultiplemethods. The owner of the object could provide each customer with a certificate giving a bit map of which methods the customer is allowed to invoke and binding the bit map to a public key using a signed certificate. Again, if the certificate holder can prove possession of the corresponding private key, he will be allowed to perform the methods inthe bit map. This approach has the property that the owner’s iden- tityneednotbeknown,aproperty usefulinsituations where privacy isimportant. 8.5.2 X.509 If everybody who wanted something signed went to the CA with a different kind of certificate, managing all the different formats would soon become a prob- lem. To solve this problem, a standard for certificates has been devised and approved by ITU. The standard is called X.509 and is in widespread use on the Internet. It has gone through three versions since the initial standardization in 1988. We willdiscuss V3. X.509 has been heavily influenced by the OSI world, borrowing some of its worst features (e.g., naming and encoding). Surprisingly, IETF went along with X.509, even though in nearly every other area, from machine addresses to tran- sport protocols to email formats, IETF generally ignored OSI and tried to do it right. TheIETF version ofX.509isdescribed inRFC 5280. At its core, X.509 is a way to describe certificates. The primary fields in a certificate are listed in Fig. 8-25. The descriptions given there should provide a general idea of what the fields do. For additional information, please consult the standard itself orRFC 2459', 'For example, if Bob works in the loan department of the Money Bank, his X.500address mightbe /C=US/O=MoneyBank/OU=Loan/CN=Bob/ where C is for country, O is for organization, OU is for organizational unit, and CN is for common name. CAs and other entities are named in a similar way. A substantial problem with X.500 names is that if Alice is trying to contact bob@moneybank.comandisgivenacertificate withanX.500name, itmaynotbe obvious to her that the certificate refers to the Bob she wants. Fortunately, start- ing with version 3, DNS names are now permitted instead ofX.500names, sothis problem mayeventually vanish. Certificates are encoded using OSI ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation 1), which is sort of like a struct in C, except with a extremely peculiar and verbose notation.

ThebasicfieldsofanX.509certificate. 8.5.3 Public Key Infrastructures Having a single CA to issue all the world’s certificates obviously would not work. Itwouldcollapse undertheloadandbeacentral pointoffailure aswell. A possible solution might be to have multiple CAs, all run by the same organization and all using the same private key to sign certificates. While this would solve the load and failure problems, it introduces a new problem: key leakage. If there were dozens of servers spread around the world, all holding the CA’s private key, the chance of the private key being stolen or otherwise leaking out would be greatly increased. Since the compromise of this key would ruin the world’s elec- tronic security infrastructure, havingasingle central CAisveryrisky. In addition, which organization would operate the CA? It is hard to imagine any authority that would be accepted worldwide as legitimate and trustworthy. In some countries, people would insist that it be a government, while in other coun- tries theywouldinsistthatitnotbeagovernment. For these reasons, a different way for certifying public keys has evolved. It goes under the general name of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). In this sec- tion, we will summarize how it works in general, although there have been many proposals,sothedetails willprobably evolve intime. A PKI has multiple components, including users, CAs, certificates, and direc- tories. What the PKI does is provide a way of structuring these components and define standards for the various documents and protocols. A particularly simple form of PKI is a hierarchy of CAs, as depicted in Fig. 8-26. In this example we have shown three levels, but in practice there might be fewer or more. The top- level CA, the root, certifies second-level CAs, which we here call RAs (Regional SEC. 8.5 MANAGEMENTOFPUBLICKEYS 811 Authorities)because they might cover some geographic region, such as a country or continent. This term is not standard, though; in fact, no term is really standard for the different levels of the tree. These in turn certify the real CAs, which issue the X.509 certificates to organizations and individuals. When the root authorizes anewRA,itgenerates anX.509certificate stating thatithasapproved theRA,in- cludes the new RA’s public key in it, signs it, and hands it to the RA', \"Similarly, when an RA approves a new CA, it produces and signs a certificate stating its approval andcontaining theCA’s publickey. Root RA2isapproved. R Its A p 2 ub is lic ap k p e r y o i v s ed. Itspublickeyis 47383AE349... Root'ssignature 47383AE349... Root'ssignature RA1 RA2 CA5isapproved. CA5isapproved.

Our PKI works like this. Suppose that Alice needs Bob’s public key in order to communicate with him, so she looks for and finds a certificate containing it, signed by CA 5. But Alice has never heard of CA 5. For all she knows, CA 5 might be Bob’s10-year-old daughter. She could gotoCA 5andsay:‘‘Prove your legitimacy.’’ CA 5 will respond with the certificate it got from RA 2, which con- tains CA 5’s public key. Now armed with CA 5’s public key, she can verify that Bob’scertificate wasindeed signedbyCA5andisthuslegal. Unless RA2isBob’s12-year-old son. So,thenextstepisforhertoask RA 2 to prove it is legitimate. The response to her query is a certificate signed by the rootandcontaining RA2’spublickey.NowAliceissureshehasBob’spublickey. But how does Alice find the root’s public key? Magic. It is assumed that everyone knows the root’s public key. For example, her browser might have been shippedwiththeroot’spublickeybuiltin. Bob is a friendly sort of guy and does not want to cause Alice a lot of work. He knows that she is going to have to check out CA 5 and RA 2, so to save her some trouble, he collects the two needed certificates and gives her the two certifi- cates along with his. Now she can use her own knowledge of the root’s public key to verify the top-level certificate and the public key contained therein to ver- ify the second one. Alice does not need to contact anyone to do the verification. 812 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 Because the certificates are all signed, she can easily detect any attempts to tam- per with their contents. A chain of certificates going back to the root like this is sometimes called achain oftrust oracertificationpath. The technique iswide- lyusedinpractice. Of course, we still have the problem of who is going to run the root. The solution is not to have a single root, but to have many roots, each with its own RAs and CAs. In fact, modern browsers come preloaded with the public keys for over 100roots, sometimes referred toas trust anchors. Inthisway, having a sin- gleworldwide trusted authority can beavoided. Butthere isnowtheissueofhowthe browser vendordecides which purported trust anchors are reliable and which are sleazy. It all comes down to the user trusting the browser vendor to make wise choices and not simply approve all trust anchors willing to pay its inclusion fee. Most browsers allow users to inspect the root keys (usually in the form of certificates signed by the root) and delete any thatseem shady. Directories Another issue forany PKI is where certificates (and their chains back to some known trust anchor) are stored\", 'One possibility is to have each user store his or her own certificates. While doing this is safe (i.e., there is no way for users to tamper with signed certificates withoutdetection), it is also inconvenient. One al- ternative that has been proposed is to use DNS as a certificate directory. Before contacting Bob, Alice probably has to look up his IP address using DNS, so why nothave DNSreturn Bob’sentire certificate chain alongwithhisIPaddress? Some people think this is the way to go, but others would prefer dedicated di- rectory servers whose only job is managing X.509 certificates. Such directories could provide lookup services by using properties of the X.500 names. For ex- ample, in theory such a directory service could answer a query such as: ‘‘Give me a list of all people named Alice who work in sales departments anywhere in the U.S. orCanada.’’ Revocation The real world is full of certificates, too, such as passports and drivers’ licenses. Sometimes these certificates can be revoked, for example, drivers’ licenses can berevoked for drunken driving and other driving offenses. The same problem occurs in the digital world: the grantor of a certificate may decide to revoke it because the person or organization holding it has abused it in some way. It can also be revoked if the subject’s private key has been exposed or, worse yet, the CA’s private key has been compromised. Thus, a PKI needs to deal with the issueofrevocation. Thepossibilityofrevocation complicates matters. SEC. 8.5 MANAGEMENTOFPUBLICKEYS 813 A first step in this direction is to have each CA periodically issue a CRL (Certificate Revocation List) giving the serial numbers of all certificates that it has revoked. Since certificates contain expiry times, the CRL need only contain the serial numbers of certificates that have not yet expired. Once its expiry time has passed, a certificate is automatically invalid, so no distinction is needed be- tween those that just timed out and those that were actually revoked. In both cases, theycannotbeusedanymore. Unfortunately, introducing CRLs means that a user who is about to use a cer- tificate must now acquire the CRL to see if the certificate has been revoked. If it has been, it should not be used. However, even if the certificate is not on the list, it might have been revokedjust after thelistwaspublished. Thus,theonlywayto really be sure is to ask the CA. And on the next use of the same certificate, the CA has to be asked again, since the certificate might have been revoked a few secondsago. Another complication is that a revoked certificate could conceivably be rein- stated, for example, if it was revoked for nonpayment of some fee that has since been paid. Having todeal with revocation (and possibly reinstatement) eliminates one of the best properties of certificates, namely, that they can be used without havingtocontact aCA. Where should CRLs be stored? A good place would be the same place the certificates themselves are stored. One strategy is for the CA to actively push out CRLs periodically and have the directories process them by simply removing the revoked certificates', 'If directories are not used for storing certificates, the CRLs can be cached at various places around the network. Since a CRL is itself a signeddocument, ifitistampered with,thattampering canbeeasily detected. Ifcertificates have longlifetimes, the CRLs willbe long, too. For example, if credit cards are valid for 5 years, the number of revocations outstanding will be much longerthan if new cards are issued every 3months. A standard way to deal with long CRLs is to issue a master list infrequently, but issue updates to it more often. Doingthisreduces thebandwidth needed fordistributing theCRLs. 8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY We have now finished our study of the tools of the trade. Most of the impor- tant techniques and protocols have been covered. The rest of the chapter is about how these techniques are applied in practice to provide network security, plus somethoughtsaboutthesocial aspects ofsecurity attheendofthechapter. Inthefollowing foursections, we willlookat communication security, that is, how to get the bits secretly and without modification from source to destination and how to keep unwanted bits outside the door. These are by no means the only security issues in networking, but they are certainly among the most important ones,makingthisagoodplacetostart ourstudy. 814 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 8.6.1 IPsec IETF has known for years that security was lacking in the Internet. Adding it was noteasy because awar broke outaboutwhere toputit. Most security experts believe that to be really secure, encryption and integrity checks have to be end to end (i.e., in the application layer). That is, the source process encrypts and/or in- tegrity protects the data and sends them to the destination process where they are decrypted and/or verified. Any tampering done in between these two processes, including within either operating system, can then be detected. The trouble with this approach is that it requires changing all the applications to make them securi- ty aware. In this view, the next best approach is putting encryption in the tran- sport layer or in a new layer between the application layer and the transport layer, makingitstillendtoendbutnotrequiring applications tobechanged. The opposite view is that users do not understand security and will not be ca- pable of using it correctly and nobody wants to modify existing programs in any way, so the network layer should authenticate and/or encrypt packets without the users being involved. After years of pitched battles, this view won enough sup- portthat anetwork layer security standard was defined. Inpart, the argument was that having network layer encryption does not prevent security-aware users from doingitrightanditdoeshelpsecurity-unaware userstosomeextent. The result of this war was a design called IPsec (IP security), which is de- scribed in RFCs 2401, 2402, and 2406, among others. Not all users want en- cryption (because it is computationally expensive). Rather than make it optional, it was decided to require encryption all the time but permit the use of a null algo- rithm. The null algorithm is described and praised for its simplicity, ease of im- plementation, andgreat speed inRFC 2410. The complete IPsec design is a framework for multiple services, algorithms, and granularities', 'The reason for multiple services is that not everyone wants to paytheprice forhavingall the services all the time, sothe services are available a la carte. The major services are secrecy, data integrity, and protection from replay attacks (where the intruder replays a conversation). All of these are based onsymmetric-key cryptographybecausehighperformance iscrucial. The reason for having multiple algorithms is that an algorithm that is now thought to be secure may be broken in the future. By making IPsec algorithm-in- dependent, the framework can survive even if some particular algorithm is later broken. The reason for having multiple granularities is to make it possible to protect a single TCP connection, all traffic between a pair of hosts, or all traffic between a pair ofsecure routers, amongother possibilities. One slightly surprising aspect of IPsec is that even thoughit is in the IP layer, it is connection oriented. Actually, that is not so surprising because to have any security, a key must be established and used for some period of time—in essence, a kind of connection by a different name. Also, connections amortize the setup SEC. 8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY 815 costs over many packets. A ‘‘connection’’ in the context of IPsec is called an SA (Security Association). An SA is a simplex connection between two endpoints and has a security identifier associated with it. If secure traffic is needed in both directions, two security associations are required. Security identifiers are carried in packets traveling on these secure connections and are used to look up keys and other relevant information whenasecure packet arrives. Technically, IPsec has two principal parts. The first part describes two new headers that can be added to packets to carry the security identifier, integrity con- trol data, and other information. The other part, ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol), deals with establishing keys. ISAKMP is a framework. The main protocol for carrying out the work is IKE (Internet Key Exchange). Version 2ofIKE as described inRFC 4306shouldbe used, as the earlier version was deeply flawed, as pointed out by Perlman and Kaufman (2000). IPsec can be used in either of two modes. In transport mode, the IPsec header is inserted just after the IP header. The Protocol field in the IP header is changed to indicate that an IPsec header follows the normal IP header (before the TCP header). The IPsec header contains security information, primarily the SA identifier, anewsequence number, andpossiblyanintegrity check ofthepayload. In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet, header and all, is encapsulated in the body of a new IP packet with a completely new IP header. Tunnel mode is useful when the tunnel ends at a location other than the final destination. In some cases, the end of the tunnel is a security gateway machine, for example, a company fire- wall. This is commonly the case for a VPN (Virtual Private Network). In this mode, the security gateway encapsulates and decapsulates packets as they pass through it', 'By terminating the tunnel at this secure machine, the machines on the company LAN do not have to be aware of IPsec. Only the security gateway has toknowaboutit. Tunnel mode is also useful when a bundle of TCP connections is aggregated and handled as one encrypted stream because it prevents an intruder from seeing who is sending how many packets to whom. Sometimes just knowing how much traffic is going where is valuable information. For example, if during a military crisis, the amount of traffic flowing between the Pentagon and the White House were to drop sharply, but the amount of traffic between the Pentagon and some military installation deep in the Colorado Rocky Mountains were to increase by the same amount, an intruder might be able to deduce some useful information fromthese data. Studyingtheflowpatterns ofpackets, even ifthey are encrypted, is called traffic analysis. Tunnel mode provides a way to foil it to some extent. The disadvantage oftunnelmode isthat itadds an extra IP header, thusincreasing packet size substantially. In contrast, transport mode does not affect packet size asmuch. The first new header is AH (Authentication Header). It provides integrity checking and antireplay security, but not secrecy (i.e., no data encryption). The 816 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 use of AH in transport mode is illustrated in Fig. 8-27. In IPv4, it is interposed between the IP header (including any options) and the TCP header. In IPv6, it is just another extension header and is treated as such. In fact, the format is close to that of a standard IPv6 extension header.

The Payloadlengthisthenumberof32-bitwordsintheAHheader minus2. The Security parameters index is the connection identifier. It is inserted by the sender to indicate a particular record in the receiver’s database. This record contains the shared key used on this connection and other information about the connection. If this protocol had been invented by ITU rather than IETF, this field wouldhave been called Virtual circuit number. The Sequence number field is used to number all the packets sent on an SA. Every packet gets a unique number, even retransmissions. In other words, the re- transmission of a packet gets a different number here than the original (even though its TCP sequence number is the same). The purpose of this field is to detect replay attacks. These sequence numbers may not wrap around. If all 232 are exhausted, anewSAmustbeestablished tocontinue communication. Finally, we come to Authentication data, which is a variable-length field that contains the payload’s digital signature. When the SA is established, the two sides negotiate which signature algorithm they are going to use', 'Normally, pub- lic-key cryptography is notused here becausepackets mustbeprocessed extreme- ly rapidly and all known public-key algorithms are too slow. Since IPsec is based on symmetric-key cryptography and the sender and receiver negotiate a shared key before setting up an SA, the shared key is used in the signature computation. One simple way is to compute the hash over the packet plus the shared key. The shared key is not transmitted, of course. A scheme like this is called an HMAC SEC. 8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY 817 (Hashed Message Authentication Code). It is much faster to compute than first runningSHA-1 andthenrunningRSAontheresult. The AH header does not allow encryption of the data, so it is mostly useful when integrity checking isneeded butsecrecy isnotneeded. Onenoteworthy fea- ture of AH is that the integrity check covers some of the fields in the IP header, namely, those that do not change as the packet moves from router to router. The Time to live field changes on each hop, for example, so it cannot be included in the integrity check. However, the IP source address is included in the check, makingitimpossible foranintruder tofalsify theoriginofapacket. The alternative IPsec header is ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload). Its useforbothtransport modeandtunnelmodeisshowninFig. 8-28.

(a)ESPintransportmode.(b)ESPintunnelmode. The ESP header consists of two 32-bit words. They are the Security parame- ters index and Sequence number fields that we saw inAH. A third wordthat gen- erally follows them (but is technically not part of the header) is the Initialization vectorused forthe data encryption, unlessnullencryption isused, inwhichcase it isomitted. ESP also provides for HMAC integrity checks, as does AH, but rather than being included in the header, they come after the payload, as shown in Fig.8-28. Puttingthe HMAC at the end has an advantage ina hardware implementation: the HMAC can be calculated as the bits are going out over the network interface and appended to the end. This is why Ethernet and other LANs have their CRCs in a trailer, rather than in a header. With AH, the packet has to be buffered and the signature computed before thepacket can besent, potentially reducing the number ofpackets/sec thatcanbesent. Given that ESP can do everything AH can do and more and is more efficient to boot, the question arises: why bother having AH at all? The answer is mostly historical. Originally, AH handled only integrity and ESP handled only secrecy. Later, integrity was added to ESP, but the people who designed AH did not want to let it die after all that work. Their only real argument is that AH checks part of the IP header, which ESP does not, but other than that it is really a weak argu- ment. Another weak argument isthat a product supportingAH but notESP might 818 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 have less trouble gettingan export license because it cannot do encryption. AH is likely tobephased outinthefuture', '8.6.2 Firewalls The ability to connect any computer, anywhere, to any other computer, any- where, is a mixed blessing. For individuals at home, wandering around the Inter- net is lots of fun. For corporate security managers, it is a nightmare. Most com- panies have large amountsofconfidential information online—trade secrets, prod- uctdevelopment plans, marketing strategies, financial analyses, etc. Disclosure of thisinformation toacompetitorcouldhave dire consequences. In addition to the danger of information leaking out, there is also a danger of information leaking in. In particular, viruses, worms, and other digital pests can breach security, destroy valuable data, and waste large amounts of administrators’ time trying to clean up the mess they leave. Often they are imported by careless employees whowanttoplaysomeniftynewgame. Consequently, mechanisms are needed to keep ‘‘good’’ bits in and ‘‘bad’’ bits out. One method is to use IPsec. This approach protects data in transit between secure sites. However, IPsec does nothingtokeep digital pests andintruders from getting onto the company LAN. To see how to accomplish this goal, we need to lookatfirewalls. Firewalls are just a modern adaptation of that old medieval security standby: digging a deep moat around your castle. This design forced everyone entering or leaving the castle topass over a single drawbridge, where they could be inspected by the I/O police. With networks, the same trick is possible: a company can have many LANs connected in arbitrary ways, but all traffic to or from the company is forced through an electronic drawbridge (firewall), as shown in Fig. 8-29. No other routeexists. Internalnetwork DeMilitarizedzone External Internet Firewall Security Web Email perimeter server server Figure8-29. Afirewallprotectinganinternalnetwork. SEC. 8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY 819 The firewall acts as a packet filter. It inspects each and every incoming and outgoing packet. Packets meeting some criterion described in rules formulated by the network administrator are forwarded normally. Those that fail the test are uncermoniously dropped. The filtering criterion is typically given as rules or tables that list sources and destinations that are acceptable, sources and destinations that are blocked, and de- fault rules aboutwhat todowith packets coming from or going to other machines. In the common case of a TCP/IP setting, a source or destination might consist of an IP address and a port. Ports indicate which service is desired. For example, TCP port 25 is for mail, and TCP port 80 is for HTTP. Some ports can simply be blocked. For example, a company could block incoming packets for all IP ad- dresses combined with TCP port 79. It was once popular for the Finger service to lookuppeople’s email addresses butislittleusedtoday. Other ports are not so easily blocked. The difficulty is that network adminis- trators want security but cannot cut off communication with the outside world. That arrangement would be much simpler and better for security, but there would be no end to user complaints about it. This is where arrangements such as the DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone) shown in Fig.8-29 come in handy. The DMZ is the part of the company network that lies outside of the security perimeter. Anything goes here', 'By placing a machine such as a Web server in the DMZ, computers on the Internet can contact it to browse the company Web site. Now the firewall can be configured to block incoming TCP traffic to port 80 so that computers on the Internet cannot use this port toattack computers onthe internal network. Toallow the Web server to be managed, the firewall can have a rule to permit connections between internal machines andtheWeb server. Firewalls have become much more sophisticated over time in an arms race with attackers. Originally, firewalls applied a rule set independently for each packet, but it proved difficult to write rules that allowed useful functionality but blocked all unwanted traffic. Stateful firewalls map packets to connections and use TCP/IP header fields to keep track of connections. This allows for rules that, for example, allow an external Web server to send packets to an internal host, but only if the internal host first establishes a connection with the external Web ser- ver. Such a rule is not possible with stateless designs that must either pass or drop allpackets fromtheexternal Webserver. Another level of sophistication up from stateful processing is for the firewall to implement application-level gateways. This processing involves the firewall looking inside packets, beyond even the TCP header, to see what the application is doing. With this capability, it is possible to distinguish HTTP traffic used for Web browsing from HTTP traffic used for peer-to-peer file sharing. Administra- tors can write rules to spare the company from peer-to-peer file sharing but allow Web browsing that is vital for business. For all of these methods, outgoing traffic can be inspected as well as incoming traffic, for example, to prevent sensitive documents frombeingemailed outsideofthecompany. 820 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 As the above discussion should make clear, firewalls violate the standard lay- ering of protocols. They are network layer devices, but they peek at the transport and applications layers to do their filtering. This makes them fragile. For instance, firewalls tend to rely on standard port numbering conventions to deter- mine what kind of traffic is carried in a packet. Standard ports are often used, but not by all computers, and not by all applications either. Some peer-to-peer appli- cations select ports dynamically to avoid being easily spotted (and blocked). En- cryption with IPSEC or other schemes hides higher-layer information from the firewall. Finally, a firewall cannot readily talk to the computers that communicate through it to tell them what policies are being applied and why their connection is being dropped. It must simply pretend to be a broken wire. For all these reasons, networking purists consider firewalls to be a blemish onthe architecture ofthe In- ternet. However, the Internet can be a dangerous place if you are a computer. Firewalls helpwiththatproblem, sotheyare likely tostay. Even if the firewall is perfectly configured, plenty of security problems still exist', 'For example, if a firewall is configured to allow in packets from only spe- cific networks (e.g., the company’s other plants), an intruder outside the firewall can put in false source addresses to bypass this check. If an insider wants to ship out secret documents, he can encrypt them or even photograph them and ship the photos as JPEG files, which bypasses any email filters. And we have not even discussed the fact that, although three-quarters of all attacks come from outside the firewall, the attacks that come from inside the firewall, forexample, fromdis- gruntled employees, are typically themostdamaging (Verizon, 2009). A different problem with firewalls is that they provide a single perimeter of defense. If that defense is breached, all bets are off. For this reason, firewalls are often used ina layered defense. For example, a firewall may guard the entrance to the internal network and each computer may also run its own firewall. Readers who think that one security checkpoint is enough clearly have not made an inter- national flightonascheduled airline recently. In addition, there is a whole other class of attacks that firewalls cannot deal with. The basic idea ofafirewall istoprevent intruders fromgettinginandsecret data from getting out. Unfortunately, there are people who have nothing better to dothan trytobringcertain sites down. They dothisbysendinglegitimatepackets at the target in great numbers until it collapses under the load. For example, to cripple a Web site, an intruder can send a TCP SYN packet to establish a con- nection. The site will then allocate a table slot for the connection and send a SYN + ACK packet in reply. If the intruder does notrespond, the table slot will betied up for a few seconds until it times out. If the intruder sends thousands of con- nection requests, all the table slots will fill up and no legitimate connections will be able to get through. Attacks in which the intruder’s goal is to shut down the target rather than steal data are called DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. Usually, the request packets have false source addresses so the intruder cannot be traced easily. DoSattacks against major Web sites are commonontheInternet. SEC. 8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY 821 An even worse variant is one in which the intruder has already broken into hundreds of computers elsewhere in the world, and then commands all of them to attack the same target at the same time. Not only does this approach increase the intruder’s firepower, but it also reduces his chances of detection since the packets are coming from a large number of machines belonging to unsuspecting users. Such an attack is called a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack. This at- tack is difficult to defend against. Even if the attacked machine can quickly recognize a bogus request, it does take some time to process and discard the re- quest, and if enough requests per second arrive, the CPU will spend all its time dealing withthem. 8.6.3 Virtual Private Networks Many companies have offices and plants scattered over many cities, some- times over multiple countries', 'In the olden days, before public data networks, it was common for such companies to lease lines from the telephone company be- tween some or all pairs of locations. Some companies still do this. A network built up from company computers and leased telephone lines is called a private network. Private networks work fine andare very secure. Ifthe onlylines available are the leased lines, notraffic can leak outofcompany locations andintruders have to physically wiretap the lines to break in, which is not easy to do. The problem with private networks is that leasing a dedicated T1 line between two points costs thousandsofdollars amonth,andT3lines are manytimes more expensive. When public data networks and later the Internet appeared, many companies wanted to movetheir data (andpossibly voice) traffic tothe publicnetwork, butwithoutgiv- ingupthesecurity oftheprivate network. This demand soon led to the invention of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), whichare overlay networks ontopofpublicnetworks butwithmostoftheproper- ties of private networks. They are called ‘‘virtual’’ because they are merely an illusion, just as virtual circuits are not real circuits and virtual memory is not real memory. One popular approach is to buildVPNsdirectlyovertheInternet. A common design is to equip each office with a firewall and create tunnels through the Inter- net between all pairs of offices, as illustrated in Fig.8-30(a). A further advantage of using the Internet for connectivity is that the tunnels can be set up on demand to include, for example, the computer of an employee who is at home or traveling as long as the person has an Internet connection. This flexibility is much greater then is provided with leased lines, yet from the perspective of the computers on the VPN, the topology looks just like the private network case, as shown in Fig.8-30(b). When the system is brought up, each pair of firewalls has to nego- tiate theparameters ofitsSA,includingtheservices, modes, algorithms, andkeys. IfIPsec isused forthe tunneling,itispossible toaggregate all traffic between any 822 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 London Paris London Paris office office Internet Home Travel Home Travel (a) (b) Figure8-30. (a)Avirtualprivatenetwork.(b)Topologyasseenfromtheinside. two pairs of offices onto a single authenticated, encrypted SA, thus providing in- tegrity control, secrecy, and evenconsiderable immunity totraffic analysis. Many firewalls have VPN capabilities built in. Some ordinary routers can do this as well, but since firewalls are primarily in the security business, it is natural tohave the tunnels begin and end at the firewalls, providing a clear separation between the company and the Internet. Thus, firewalls, VPNs, and IPsec with ESP in tun- nelmodeare anatural combination andwidely usedinpractice. Once the SAs have been established, traffic can begin flowing. To a router within the Internet, a packet traveling along a VPN tunnel is just an ordinary packet. The only thing unusual about it is the presence of the IPsec header after the IP header, butsince these extra headers have noeffect ontheforwarding proc- ess,therouters donotcare aboutthisextra header. Another approach that isgaining popularityistohave the ISP set upthe VPN. Using MPLS (as discussed in Chap. 5), paths for the VPN traffic can be set up a- cross the ISP network between the company offices', 'These paths keep the VPN traffic separate from other Internet traffic and can be guaranteed a certain amount ofbandwidth orother qualityofservice. A key advantage of a VPN is that it is completely transparent to all user soft- ware. The firewalls set up and manage the SAs. The only person who is even aware of this setup is the system administrator who has to configure and manage the security gateways, or the ISP administrator who has to configure the MPLS paths. To everyone else, it is like having a leased-line private network again. For more aboutVPNs, see Lewis (2006). 8.6.4 Wireless Security Itissurprisingly easy todesign a system using VPNs and firewalls that is log- ically completely secure butthat, inpractice, leaks like asieve. Thissituation can occur if some of the machines are wireless and use radio communication, which passes right over the firewall in both directions. The range of 802.11 networks is SEC. 8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY 823 often a few hundred meters, so anyone who wants to spy on a company can sim- ply drive into the employee parking lot in the morning, leave an 802.11-enabled notebook computer in the car to record everything it hears, and take off for the day. By late afternoon, the hard disk will be full of valuable goodies. Theoreti- cally, this leakage is not supposed to happen. Theoretically, people are not sup- posedtorobbanks,either. Much of the security problem can be traced to the manufacturers of wireless base stations (access points) trying to make their products user friendly. Usually, if the user takes the device out of the box and plugs it into the electrical power socket, it begins operating immediately—nearly always with no security at all, blurtingsecrets toeveryonewithin radio range. Ifit isthen pluggedinto anEther- net, all the Ethernet traffic suddenly appears in the parking lot as well. Wireless isasnooper’sdream come true: free data withouthaving todoany work. Itthere- fore goes without saying that security is even more important forwireless systems than for wired ones. In this section, we will look at some ways wireless networks handle security. Some additional information is given by Nichols and Lekkas (2002). 802.11Security Part of the 802.11 standard, originally called 802.11i, prescribes a data link- level security protocol for preventing a wireless node from reading or interfering with messages sent between another pair of wireless nodes. It also goes by the trade name WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2). Plain WPA is an interim scheme thatimplements asubsetof802.11i. Itshouldbeavoided infavorofWPA2. We willdescribe 802.11ishortly, butwillfirst note that it is a replacement for WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), the first generation of 802.11 security proto- cols. WEP was designed by a networking standards committee, which is a com- pletely different process than, for example, the way NIST selected the design of AES. The results were devastating. What was wrong with it? Pretty much every- thing from a security perspective as it turns out. For example, WEP encrypted data for confidentiality by XORing it with the output of a stream cipher. Unfor- tunately, weak keying arrangements meant that the output was often reused', 'This led to trivial ways to defeat it. As another example, the integrity check was based on a 32-bit CRC. That is an efficient code for detecting transmission errors, but it isnotacryptographically strongmechanism fordefeating attackers. These and other design flaws made WEP very easy to compromise. The first practical demonstration that WEP was broken came when Adam Stubblefieldwas an intern at AT&T (Stubblefield et al., 2002). He was able to code up and test an attack outlined by Fluhrer et al. (2001) in one week, of which most of the time was spent convincing management to buy him a WiFi card to use in his experi- ments. Software tocrack WEP passwords within a minute isnowfreely available and the use of WEP is very strongly discouraged. While it does prevent casual 824 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 access it does not provide any real form of security. The 802.11i group was put together in a hurry when it was clear that WEP was seriously broken. It produced aformal standard byJune2004. Now we will describe 802.11i, which does provide real security if it is set up and used properly. There are two common scenarios in which WPA2 is used. The first is a corporate setting, in which a company has a separate authentication ser- ver that has a username and password database that can be used to determine if a wireless client is allowed to access the network. In this setting, clients use stan- dard protocols to authenticate themselves to the network. The main standards are 802.1X, with which the access point lets the client carry on a dialogue with the authentication server and observes the result, and EAP (Extensible Authentica- tion Protocol) (RFC 3748), which tells how the client and the authentication ser- ver interact. Actually, EAP is a framework and other standards define the proto- col messages. However, we will not delve into the many details of this exchange becausetheydonotmuchmatter foranoverview. The second scenario is in a home setting in which there is no authentication server. Instead, there is a single shared password that is used by clients to access the wireless network. This setup is less complex than having an authentication server, which is why it is used at home and in small businesses, but it is less secure as well. The main difference is that with an authentication server each cli- ent gets a key for encrypting traffic that is not known by the other clients. With a single shared password, different keys are derived for each client, but all clients have thesame password andcan derive eachothers’ keysiftheywant to. The keys that are used to encrypt traffic are computed as part of an authentication handshake. The handshake happens right after the client associates with awireless network and authenticates with an authentication server, if there is one. At the start of the handshake, the client has either the shared network pass- word orits password forthe authentication server. This password isused toderive a master key. However, the master key is not used directly to encrypt packets', 'It isstandard cryptographic practice toderive asession keyforeach period ofusage, to change the key for different sessions, and to expose the master key to observa- tionaslittleaspossible. Itisthissession keythatiscomputed inthehandshake. The session key is computed with the four-packet handshake shown in Fig.8- 31. First, the AP (access point) sends a random number for identification. Ran- dom numbers used just once in security protocols like this one are called nonces, which is more-or-less a contraction of ‘‘number used once.’’ The client also picks its own nonce. It uses the nonces, its MAC address and that of the AP, and the master key to compute a session key, K . The session key is split into portions, S each of which is used for different purposes, butwe have omitted this detail. Now the client has session keys, but the AP does not. So the client sends its nonce to the AP, and the AP performs the same computation to derive the same session keys. The nonces can be sent inthe clear becausethe keys cannotbederived from them without extra, secret information. The message from the client is protected SEC. 8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY 825 with an integrity check called a MIC (Message Integrity Check) based on the session key. The APcan check that the MIC is correct, and so the message indeed must have come from the client, after it computes the session keys. A MIC isjust another name for a message authentication code, as in an HMAC. The term MIC is often used instead for networking protocols because of the potential for confu- sionwithMAC(Medium AccessControl)addresses. tneilC 1 Nonce AP 2 Nonce ,MIC C S 3 K (K ),MIC S G S 4 )PA(tnioPsseccA Computesession keysK fromMAC S addresses,nonces, andmasterkey Computesession keysK ,same S astheclient Verify Distributegroupkey,K G AP hasK S K (ACK),MIC S S Verify Acknowledge client hasK S Figure8-31. The802.11ikeysetuphandshake. Inthelast twomessages, the AP distributes a groupkey, K ,tothe client, and G the client acknowledges the message. Receipt of these messages lets the client verify that the AP has the correct session keys, and vice versa. The group key is used for broadcast and multicast traffic on the 802.11 LAN. Because the result of the handshake is that every client has its own encryption keys, none of these keys can be used by the AP to broadcast packets to all of the wireless clients; a sepa- rate copy would need to be sent to each client using its key. Instead, a shared key is distributed so that broadcast traffic can be sent only once and received by all theclients. Itmustbeupdatedasclients leave andjointhenetwork. Finally, we get to the part where the keys are actually used to provide securi- ty. Two protocols can be used in 802.11i to provide message confidentiality, in- tegrity, and authentication. Like WPA, one of the protocols, called TKIP (Tem- porary Key Integrity Protocol), was an interim solution. It was designed to im- prove security on old and slow 802.11 cards, so that at least some security that is better than WEP can be rolled out as a firmware upgrade', 'However, it, too, has now been broken so you are better off with the other, recommended protocol, CCMP. What does CCMP stand for? It is short for the somewhat spectacular name CountermodewithCipher blockchaining Message authentication code Pro- tocol. Wewilljustcall itCCMP. Youcan call itanythingyouwant. 826 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 CCMP works in a fairly straightforward way. It uses AES encryption with a 128-bit key and block size. The key comes from the session key. To provide con- fidentiality, messages are encrypted with AES in counter mode. Recall that we discussed cipher modes in Sec. 8.2.3. These modes are what prevent the same message from being encrypted to the same set of bits each time. Counter mode mixes a counter into the encryption. To provide integrity, the message, including header fields, is encrypted with cipher block chaining mode and the last 128-bit block is kept as the MIC. Then both the message (encrypted with counter mode) and the MIC are sent. The client and the AP can each perform this encryption, or verify this encryption when a wireless packet is received. For broadcast or multi- cast messages, thesame procedure isusedwiththegroupkey. Bluetooth Security Bluetooth has a considerably shorter range than 802.11, so it cannot easily be attacked from the parking lot, but security is still an issue here. For example, im- agine that Alice’s computer is equipped with a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. In the absence of security, if Trudy happened to be in the adjacent office, she could read everything Alice typed in, including all her outgoing email. She could also capture everything Alice’s computer sent to the Bluetooth printer sitting next to it (e.g., incoming email and confidential reports). Fortunately, Bluetooth has anela- borate security scheme to try tofoil the world’s Trudies. We willnowsummarize themainfeatures ofit. Bluetooth version 2.1 and later has four security modes, ranging from nothing at all to full data encryption and integrity control. As with 802.11, if security is disabled (the default for older devices), there is no security. Most users have se- curity turned off until a serious breach has occurred; then they turn it on. In the agricultural world, this approach is known as locking the barn doorafter the horse hasescaped. Bluetooth provides security in multiple layers. In the physical layer, frequen- cy hopping provides a tiny little bit of security, but since any Bluetooth device that moves into a piconet has to be told the frequency hopping sequence, this se- quence is obviously not a secret. The real security starts when the newly arrived slave asks for a channel with the master. Before Bluetooth 2.1, two devices were assumed to share a secret key set up in advance. In some cases, both are hardwired by the manufacturer (e.g., for a headset and mobile phone sold as a unit). In other cases, one device (e.g., the headset) has a hardwired key and the user has to enter that key into the other device (e.g., the mobile phone) as a decimal number. These shared keys are called passkeys', 'Unfortunately, the passkeys are often hardcoded to ‘‘1234’’ or another predictable value, and in any case are four decimal digits, allowing only 104 choices. With simple secure pair- ing in Bluetooth 2.1, devices pick a code from a six-digit range, which makes the passkey muchlesspredictable butstillfarfromsecure. SEC. 8.6 COMMUNICATION SECURITY 827 Toestablish a channel, the slave and master each check to see if the other one knows the passkey. If so, they negotiate whether that channel will be encrypted, integrity controlled, orboth. Then they select arandom128-bitsession key, some of whose bits may bepublic. The point ofallowing thiskey weakening istocom- ply with government restrictions in various countries designed to prevent the exportoruseofkeyslongerthanthegovernmentcan break. Encryption uses a stream cipher called E ; integrity control uses SAFER+. 0 Both are traditional symmetric-key block ciphers. SAFER+ was submitted to the AES bake-off but was eliminated in the first round because it was slower than the other candidates. Bluetooth was finalized before the AES cipher was chosen; otherwise, itwouldmostlikely haveusedRijndael. The actual encryption using the stream cipher is shown in Fig.8-14, with the plaintext XORed with the keystream to generate the ciphertext. Unfortunately, E itself (like RC4) may have fatal weaknesses (Jakobsson and Wetzel, 2001). 0 While it was not broken at the time of this writing, its similarities to the A5/1 cipher, whose spectacular failure compromises all GSM telephone traffic, are cause for concern (Biryukov et al., 2000). It sometimes amazes people (including the authors of this book), that in the perennial cat-and-mouse game between the cryptographers and the cryptanalysts, the cryptanalysts are so often on the win- ningside. Another security issue is that Bluetooth authenticates only devices, not users, so theft of a Bluetooth device may give the thief access to the user’s financial and other accounts. However, Bluetooth also implements security in the upper layers, so even in the event of a breach of link-level security, some security may remain, especially for applications that require a PIN code to be entered manually from somekindofkeyboardtocomplete thetransaction. 8.7 AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS Authentication isthetechnique bywhich aprocess verifies that itscommuni- cation partner is whoit issupposedtobe andnotan imposter. Verifying the iden- tity of a remote process in the face of a malicious, active intruder is surprisingly difficult and requires complex protocols based on cryptography. In this section, we will studysome of the many authentication protocols that are used on insecure computer networks. As an aside, some people confuse authorization with authentication. Authentication deals withthequestion ofwhether youare actually communicating with a specific process. Authorization is concerned with what that process is per- mitted to do. For example, say a client process contacts a file server and says: ‘‘I am Scott’s process and I want to delete the file cookbook.old.’’ From the file ser- ver’s pointofview, twoquestionsmustbeanswered: 828 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 1. Isthisactually Scott’s process (authentication)? 2. IsScott allowed todelete cookbook.old(authorization)? Onlyafter bothofthese questionshave been unambiguouslyanswered inthe affir- mative can the requested action take place. The former question is really the key one', 'Once the file server knows to whom it is talking, checking authorization is just a matter of lookingupentries inlocal tables ordatabases. For thisreason, we willconcentrate onauthentication inthissection. The general model that essentially all authentication protocols use is this. Alice starts outbysending a message either toBobortoatrusted KDC(KeyDis- tribution Center), which is expected to be honest. Several other message ex- changes follow in various directions. As these messages are being sent, Trudy may intercept, modify, or replay them in order to trick Alice and Bob or just to gumuptheworks. Nevertheless, when the protocol has been completed, Alice is sure she is talk- ingtoBobandBobissure he istalking toAlice. Furthermore, inmostofthepro- tocols, the two of them will also have established a secret session key for use in the upcoming conversation. In practice, for performance reasons, all data traffic is encrypted using symmetric-key cryptography (typically AES or triple DES), al- though public-key cryptography is widely used for the authentication protocols themselves andforestablishing thesession key. The point of using a new, randomly chosen session key for each new con- nection is to minimize the amount of traffic that gets sent with the users’ secret keysorpublickeys, toreduce the amountofciphertext anintruder can obtain, and to minimize the damage done if a process crashes and its core dump falls into the wrong hands. Hopefully, the only key present then will be the session key. All the permanent keys should have been carefully zeroed out after the session was established. 8.7.1 Authentication Based on aShared Secret Key For our first authentication protocol, we will assume that Alice and Bob al- ready share a secret key, K . This shared key might have been agreed upon on AB thetelephoneorinperson,but,inanyevent, notonthe(insecure) network. This protocol is based on a principle found in many authentication protocols: one party sends a random number to the other, who then transforms it in a special way and returns the result. Such protocols are called challenge-response proto- cols. In this and subsequent authentication protocols, the following notation will beused: A,Bare theidentitiesofAlice andBob. R ’sare thechallenges, where iidentifies thechallenger. i K ’sare keys,where iindicates theowner. i K isthesession key. S SEC. 8.7 AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS 829 The message sequence forourfirst shared-key authentication protocol is illus- trated in Fig.8-32. Inmessage 1,Alice sends her identity,A,toBobina way that Bob understands. Bob, of course, has no way of knowing whether this message came from Alice or from Trudy, so he chooses a challenge, a large random num- ber, R , and sends it back to ‘‘Alice’’ as message 2, in plaintext. Alice then en- B crypts the message with the key she shares with Bob and sends the ciphertext, K (R ), back in message 3. When Bob sees this message, he immediately AB B knows that it came from Alice because Trudy does not know K and thus could AB not have generated it. Furthermore, since R was chosen randomly from a large B space (say, 128-bit random numbers), it is very unlikely that Trudy would have seen R and its response inan earlier session. It is equally unlikely that she could B guessthecorrect responsetoanychallenge', 'A ecilA 1 2 R B 3 K (R ) AB B 4 5 K (R ) AB A boB R A Figure8-32. Two-wayauthenticationusingachallenge-responseprotocol. At this point, Bob is sure he is talking to Alice, but Alice is not sure of any- thing. For all Alice knows, Trudy might have intercepted message 1 and sent back R inresponse. Maybe Bobdiedlastnight. Tofindouttowhomshe istalk- B ing, Alice picks a random number, R , and sends it to Bob as plaintext, in mes- A sage 4. When Bob responds with K (R ), Alice knows she is talking to Bob. If AB A they wish to establish a session key now, Alice can pick one, K , and send it to S Bobencrypted withK . AB The protocol of Fig. 8-32 contains five messages. Let us see if we can be clever and eliminate some ofthem. One approach isillustratedinFig.8-33. Here Alice initiates the challenge-response protocol instead of waiting for Bob to do it. Similarly, while he is responding to Alice’s challenge, Bob sends his own. The entire protocol can bereduced tothree messages instead offive. Is this new protocol an improvement over the original one? In one sense it is: it is shorter. Unfortunately, it is also wrong. Under certain circumstances, Trudy can defeat this protocol by using what is known as a reflection attack. In partic- ular, Trudy can break it if it is possible to open multiple sessions with Bob at once. This situation would be true, for example, if Bob is a bank and is prepared toacceptmanysimultaneous connectionsfromteller machines atonce. 830 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 ecilA 1 A,R A 2 R K (R ) B, AB A 3 K (R ) AB B boB Figure8-33.

She can open a second session with message 3, supplying the R taken from B message 2 as her challenge. Bob calmly encrypts it and sends back K (R ) in AB B message 4. We have shaded the messages on the second session to make them stand out. Now Trudy has the missing information, so she can complete the first session and abort the second one. Bob is now convinced that Trudy is Alice, so when she asks for her bank account balance, he gives it to her without question. Then when she asks him to transfer it all to a secret bank account in Switzerland, hedoessowithoutamoment’s hesitation. The moral ofthisstoryis: Designing acorrect authentication protocol ismuchharderthanitlooks. The followingfourgeneral rules oftenhelpthedesigner avoidcommonpitfalls: SEC. 8.7 AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS 831 1. Have the initiator prove who she is before the responder has to. This avoids Bob giving away valuable information before Trudy has to giveanyevidence ofwhosheis. 2', 'Have the initiator and responder use different keys for proof, even if thismeans havingtwoshared keys,K andK′ . AB AB 3. Have the initiator and responder draw their challenges from different sets. For example, the initiator must use even numbers and the re- spondermustuseoddnumbers. 4. Make the protocol resistant to attacks involving a second parallel session in which information obtained in one session is used in a dif- ferent one. Ifeven oneofthese rules isviolated, the protocol can frequently bebroken. Here, allfourrules were violated, withdisastrous consequences. Now let us go take a closer look at Fig. 8-32. Surely that protocol is not sub- ject to a reflection attack? Maybe. It is quite subtle. Trudy was able to defeat our protocol by using a reflection attack because it was possible to open a second session with Bob and trick him into answering his own questions. What would happen if Alice were a general-purpose computer that also accepted multiple ses- sions,rather thanapersonatacomputer? Let ustake alookwhat Trudycan do. To see how Trudy’s attack works, see Fig.8-35. Alice starts out by announc- ing her identity in message 1. Trudy intercepts this message and begins her own session with message 2, claiming to be Bob. Again we have shaded the session 2 messages. Alice respondstomessage 2bysaying inmessage 3:‘‘Youclaim tobe Bob?Prove it.’’Atthispoint,TrudyisstuckbecauseshecannotprovesheisBob. What does Trudy do now? She goes back to the first session, where it is her turn to send a challenge, and sends the R she got in message 3. Alice kindly re- A sponds to it in message 5, thus supplying Trudy with the information she needs to send in message 6 in session 2. At this point, Trudy is basically home free be- cause she has successfully responded to Alice’s challenge in session 2. She can now cancel session 1, send over any old number for the rest of session 2, and she willhaveanauthenticated session withAlice insession2. But Trudy is nasty, and she really wants to rub it in. Instead, of sending any old number over to complete session 2, she waits until Alice sends message 7, Alice’s challenge for session 1. Of course, Trudy does not know how to respond, so she uses the reflection attack again, sending back R as message 8. Alice A2 conveniently encrypts R in message 9. Trudy now switches back to session 1 A2 and sends Alice the number she wants in message 10, conveniently copied from whatAlice sent inmessage 9. Atthis pointTrudyhas twofully authenticated ses- sionswithAlice. This attack has a somewhat different result than the attack on the three-mes- sage protocol that we saw in Fig. 8-34. This time, Trudy has two authenticated 832 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 A ecilA 1 2 B 3 4 5 K (R ) AB A ydurT Firstsession Secondsession R A R A Firstsession 6 K (R ) Secondsession AB A 7 R A2 Firstsession 8 R A2 9 Secondsession K (R ) AB A2 10 K (R ) Firstsession AB A2 Figure8-35.

In the previous example, she had one authenticated con- nection with Bob', 'Again here, if we had applied all the general authentication protocol rules discussed earlier, this attack could have been stopped. For a de- tailed discussion of these kinds of attacks and how to thwart them, see Bird et al. (1993). They also show how it is possible to systematically construct protocols that are provably correct. The simplest such protocol is nevertheless a bitcompli- cated, sowewillnowshowadifferent class ofprotocol thatalsoworks. The new authentication protocol is shown in Fig. 8-36 (Bird et al., 1993). It uses anHMAC ofthe type we saw when studyingIPsec. Alice starts outbysend- ing Bob a nonce, R , as message 1. Bob responds by selecting his own nonce, A R , and sending it back along with an HMAC. The HMAC is formed bybuilding B a data structure consisting of Alice’s nonce, Bob’s nonce, their identities, and the shared secret key, K . Thisdata structure isthen hashed into the HMAC, forex- AB ample, using SHA-1. When Alice receives message 2, she now has R (which A she picked herself), R , which arrives as plaintext, the two identities, and the B secret key, K , which she has known all along, so she can compute the HMAC AB herself. If it agrees with the HMAC in the message, she knows she is talking to Bob because Trudy does not know K and thus cannot figure out which HMAC AB tosend. Alice respondstoBobwithanHMACcontaining justthetwononces. Can Trudy somehow subvert this protocol? No, because she cannot force ei- ther party to encrypt or hash a value of her choice, as happened in Fig.8-34 and Fig.8-35. Both HMACs include values chosen by the sending party, something thatTrudycannotcontrol.

An alternative scheme that is often used instead of computing the HMAC over a series of items is to en- crypt theitems sequentially usingcipher blockchaining. 8.7.2 Establishing aShared Key: The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange So far, we have assumed that Alice and Bob share a secret key. Suppose that they do not (because so far there is no universally accepted PKI for signing and distributing certificates). How can they establish one? One way would be for Alice to call Bob and give him her key on the phone, but he would probably start out by saying: ‘‘How do I know you are Alice and not Trudy?’’ They could try to arrange a meeting, with each one bringing a passport, a driver’s license, and three major credit cards, but being busy people, they might not be able to find a mutu- ally acceptabledate formonths. Fortunately, incredible asitmaysound,there isa way for total strangers to establish a shared secret key in broad daylight, even withTrudycarefully recording every message. The protocol that allows strangers toestablish ashared secret keyis called the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (Diffie and Hellman, 1976) and works as follows', 'Alice and Bob have to agree on two large numbers, n and g, where n is a prime, (n −1)/2 is also a prime, and certain conditions apply to g. These numbers may be public, so either one of them can just pick n and g and tell the other openly. Now Alice picks a large (say, 1024-bit) number, x, and keeps it secret. Similarly, Bobpicksalarge secret number, y. Alice initiates the key exchange protocol by sending Bob a message con- taining (n, g, gx modn), as shown inFig. 8-37. Bob responds bysending Alice a message containing gy modn. Now Alice raises the number Bob sent her to the xth power modulo n to get (gy modn)x mod n. Bob performs a similar operation to get (gx modn)y mod n. By the laws of modular arithmetic, both calculations yield gxy modn. Lo and behold, as if by magic, Alice and Bob suddenly share a secret key,gxy modn. 834 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 Alice Bob picksx picksy 1 n,g,gxmodn 2 gymodn Alicecomputes Bobcomputes (gymodn)x (gxmodn)y =gxymodn =gxymodn ecilA boB modn modn Figure8-37. TheDiffie-Hellman keyexchange. Trudy, of course, has seen both messages. She knows g and n from message 1. If she could compute x and y, she could figure out the secret key. The trouble is, given only gx modn, she cannot find x. No practical algorithm for computing discrete logarithms moduloaverylarge prime numberisknown. To make this example more concrete, we will use the (completely unrealistic) values of n =47 and g =3. Alice picks x =8 and Bob picks y =10. Both of these are kept secret. Alice’s message to Bob is (47, 3, 28) because 38 mod47 is 28. Bob’s message toAlice is(17). Alice computes 178 mod47,whichis4. Bob computes 2810 mod47,which is 4. Alice and Bob have now independently deter- mined that the secret key is now 4. To find the key, Trudy now has to solve the equation 3x mod47=28, which can be done by exhaustive search for small num- bers likethis,butnotwhenallthe numbers are hundreds of bits long. All currently known algorithms simply take far too long, even on massively parallel, lightning fastsupercomputers. Despite the elegance of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, there is a problem: when Bob gets the triple (47, 3, 28), how does he know it is from Alice and not fromTrudy? There isnoway hecan know. Unfortunately, Trudycan exploit this fact to deceive both Alice and Bob, as illustrated in Fig. 8-38. Here, while Alice and Bob are choosing x and y, respectively, Trudy picks her own random number, z. Alice sends message 1, intended for Bob. Trudy intercepts it and sends mes- sage 2 to Bob, using the correct g and n (which are public anyway) but with her own z instead of x. She also sends message 3 back to Alice. Later Bob sends message 4toAlice, whichTrudyagain intercepts andkeeps. Now everybody does the modular arithmetic. Alice computes the secret key as gxz modn, and so does Trudy (for messages to Alice). Bob computes gyz modnandsodoes Trudy(for messages toBob)', 'Alice thinks she is talking to Bob, so she establishes a session key (with Trudy). So does Bob. Every message that Alice sends onthe encrypted session iscaptured byTrudy, stored, modified if desired, and then (optionally) passed on to Bob. Similarly, in the other direction, Trudy sees everything and can modify all messages at will, while both Alice and Bobare underthe illusionthat they have asecure channel toone another.

It is also called the bucket brigade attack, because it vaguely resembles an old-time volunteer fire department passingbuckets alongthelinefromthefire trucktothefire. 8.7.3 Authentication Using aKey Distribution Center Setting up a shared secret with a stranger almost worked, but not quite. On the other hand, it probably was not worth doing in the first place (sour grapes at- tack). To talk to n people this way, you would need n keys. For popular people, key management would become a real burden, especially if each key had to be storedonaseparate plastic chipcard. A different approach is to introduce a trusted key distribution center. In this model, each user has a single key shared with the KDC. Authentication and ses- sion key management now go through the KDC. The simplest known KDC authentication protocol involving two parties and a trusted KDC is depicted in Fig.8-39. 1 A,K (B,K ) A S CDK 2 ecilA boB K (A,K ) B S Figure8-39. AfirstattemptatanauthenticationprotocolusingaKDC. The idea behind this protocol is simple: Alice picks a session key, K , and S tells the KDC that she wants to talk to Bob using K . This message is encrypted S 836 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 withthesecret keyAlice shares (only)with the KDC, K . The KDC decrypts this A message, extracting Bob’s identity and the session key. It then constructs a new message containing Alice’s identity and the session key and sends this message to Bob. This encryption is done with K , the secret key Bob shares with the KDC. B When Bob decrypts the message, he learns that Alice wants to talk to him and whichkeyshewants touse. The authentication here happens for free. The KDC knows that message 1 must have come from Alice, since no one else would have been able to encrypt it with Alice’s secret key. Similarly, Bob knows that message 2 must have come fromtheKDC, whomhetrusts, since nooneelse knowshissecret key. Unfortunately, this protocol has a serious flaw. Trudy needs some money, so she figures out some legitimate service she can perform for Alice, makes an attractive offer, and gets the job. After doing the work, Trudy then politely re- quests Alice topay bybanktransfer. Alice then establishes asession keywithher banker, Bob. Then she sends Bob a message requesting money to be transferred toTrudy’saccount. Meanwhile, Trudy is back to her old ways, snooping on the network. She copies both message 2 in Fig.8-39 and the money-transfer request that follows it', 'Later, she replays both of them to Bob who thinks: ‘‘Alice must have hired Trudy again. She clearly does good work.’’ Bob then transfers an equal amount of mon- ey from Alice’s account to Trudy’s. Some time after the 50th message pair, Bob runs out of the office to find Trudy to offer her a big loan so she can expand her obviouslysuccessfulbusiness. Thisproblem iscalled thereplay attack. Several solutions to the replay attack are possible. The first one is to include a timestamp in each message. Then, if anyone receives an obsolete message, it can be discarded. The trouble with this approach is that clocks are never exactly synchronized over a network, so there has to be some interval during which a timestamp is valid. Trudy can replay the message during this interval and get away withit. The secondsolution istoputa nonceineachmessage. Each party then has to remember all previous nonces and reject any message containing a previously used nonce. But nonces have to be remembered forever, lest Trudy try replaying a 5-year-old message. Also, if some machine crashes and it loses its nonce list, it is again vulnerable to a replay attack. Timestamps and nonces can be combined to limit how longnonces have to be remembered, but clearly the protocol is going togetalotmorecomplicated. A more sophisticated approach to mutual authentication is to use a multiway challenge-response protocol. A well-known example of such a protocol is the Needham-Schroeder authentication protocol (Needham and Schroeder, 1978), onevariant ofwhichisshowninFig.8-40. The protocol begins with Alice telling the KDC that she wants to talk to Bob. This message contains a large random number, R , as a nonce. The KDC sends A back message 2 containing Alice’s random number, a session key, and a ticket SEC. 8.7 AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS 837 1 R ,A,B A 2 K (R ,B,K ,K (A,K )) A A S B S CDK 3 ecilA boB K (A,K ),K (R ) B S S A2 4 K (R –1),R S A2 B 5 K (R –1) S B Figure8-40. TheNeedham-Schroeder authenticationprotocol. that she can send to Bob. The point of the random number, R , is to assure Alice A that message 2 is fresh, and not a replay. Bob’s identity is also enclosed in case Trudy gets any funny ideas about replacing B in message 1 with her own identity so the KDC will encrypt the ticket at the end of message 2with K instead of K . T B The ticket encrypted with K is included inside the encrypted message to prevent B Trudyfromreplacing itwithsomething else onthewayback toAlice. Alice nowsendstheticket toBob,alongwith anew randomnumber, R ,en- A2 crypted with the session key, K . In message 4, Bob sends back K (R −1) to S S A2 prove to Alice that she is talking to the real Bob. Sending back K (R ) would S A2 nothave worked, since Trudycouldjusthave stolen itfrommessage 3. After receiving message 4, Alice is now convinced that she is talking to Bob and that no replays could have been used so far', 'After all, she just generated R A2 a few milliseconds ago. The purpose of message 5 is to convince Bob that it is indeed Alice heistalkingto,andnoreplays are beingusedhere either. Byhaving each party both generate a challenge and respond to one, the possibility of any kindofreplay attack iseliminated. Although this protocol seems pretty solid, it does have a slight weakness. If Trudy ever manages to obtain an old session key in plaintext, she can initiate a new session with Bob by replaying the message 3 that corresponds to the compromised key and convince him that she is Alice (Denning and Sacco, 1981). This time she can plunder Alice’s bank account without having to perform the legitimateservice even once. Needham and Schroeder (1987) later published a protocol that corrects this problem. In the same issue of the same journal, Otway and Rees (1987) also pub- lished a protocol that solves the problem in a shorter way. Figure 8-41 shows a slightlymodified Otway-Rees protocol. In the Otway-Rees protocol, Alice starts out by generating a pair of random numbers: R, which will be used as a common identifier, and R , which Alice will A use to challenge Bob. When Bob gets this message, he constructs a new message from the encrypted part of Alice’s message and an analogous one of his own. 838 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 2 3 4 K B (R B ,K S ) K (R ,K ) A A S CDK 1 ecilA boB A,B,R,K (A,B,R,R ) A A A,K (A,B,R,R ), A A B,K (A,B,R,R ) B B Figure8-41.

The KDC checks to see if the R in both parts is the same. It might not be if Trudyhas tampered with Rinmessage 1orreplacedpart ofmessage 2. Ifthetwo Rs match, the KDC believes that the request message from Bob is valid. It then generates a session key and encrypts it twice, once for Alice and once for Bob. Each message contains the receiver’s randomnumber, as proof that the KDC, and not Trudy, generated the message. At this point, both Alice and Bob are in possession of the same session key and can start communicating. The first time they exchange data messages, each one can see that the other one has an identical copyofK ,sotheauthentication isthencomplete. S 8.7.4 Authentication Using Kerberos An authentication protocol used in many real systems (including Windows 2000 and later versions) is Kerberos, which is based on a variant of Needham- Schroeder. It is named for a multiheaded dog in Greek mythology that used to guard the entrance toHades (presumably tokeep undesirablesout). Kerberos was designed at M.I.T. to allow workstation users to access network resources in a secure way. Itsbiggest difference fromNeedham-Schroeder isitsassumption that all clocks are fairly well synchronized. The protocol has gone through several iterations. V5 is the one that is widely used in industry and defined in RFC 4120. The earlier version, V4, was finally retired after serious flaws were found (Yu et al., 2004)', 'V5improves onV4withmany small changes totheprotocol andsome improved features, such as the fact that it no longer relies on the now-dated DES. Formore information, see Neuman andTs’o(1994). Kerberos involvesthree servers inadditiontoAlice (aclient workstation): 1. Authentication Server (AS): Verifies users duringlogin. 2. Ticket-Granting Server (TGS): Issues‘‘proofofidentitytickets.’’ 3. Bobtheserver: Actually doestheworkAlice wants performed. SEC. 8.7 AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS 839 AS is similar to a KDC in that it shares a secret password with every user. The TGS’s job is to issue tickets that can convince the real servers that the bearer of a TGS ticket really iswhoheorsheclaims tobe. Tostart asession, Alice sits downat anarbitrary public workstation and types her name. The workstation sends her name and the name of the TGS to the AS in plaintext, as shown in message 1 of Fig. 8-42. What comes back is a session key and a ticket, K (A, K t), intended for the TGS. The session key is encrypted TGS S, using Alice’s secret key, so that only Alice can decrypt it. Only when message 2 arrives does the workstation ask for Alice’s password—not before then. The password isthen used togenerate K inorder todecrypt message 2and obtain the A session key. Atthispoint, the workstation overwrites Alice’s password tomake sure that it is only inside the workstation for a few milliseconds at most. If Trudy tries log- ging in as Alice, the password she types will be wrong and the workstation will detect thisbecausethe standard part ofmessage 2willbeincorrect. ecilA SA SGT boB 1 A,TGS 2 K (TGS,K ,t),K (A,K ,t) A S TGS S 3 B,K (A,t),K (A,K ,t) S TGS S 4 K (B,K ,t),K (A,B,K ,t) S AB B AB 5 K (A,t),K (A,B,K ,t) AB B AB 6 K (t) AB Figure8-42. TheoperationofKerberosV5. After she logsin,Alice may tell the workstation that she wants to contact Bob the file server. The workstation then sends message 3 to the TGS asking for a ticket tousewithBob. The keyelement inthisrequest istheticket K (A, K t), TGS S, which is encrypted with the TGS’s secret key and used as proof that the sender really is Alice. The TGS responds in message 4 by creating a session key, K , AB forAlice touse withBob. Two versions ofit are sentback. The firstisencrypted with only K , so Alice can read it. The second is another ticket, encrypted with S Bob’skey,K ,soBobcan read it. B 840 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 Trudycan copymessage 3and trytouse it again, but she will be foiled bythe encrypted timestamp, t, sent along with it. Trudy cannot replace the timestamp with amore recentone, because she does notknow K , the session key Alice uses S to talk to the TGS. Even if Trudy replays message 3 quickly, all she will get is another copyofmessage 4, which she could notdecrypt the first time and will not beable todecrypt thesecondtime either. Now Alice can send K to Bob via the new ticket to establish a session with AB him (message 5). This exchange is also timestamped. The optional response (message 6)isprooftoAlice thatsheisactually talking toBob,nottoTrudy', 'After this series of exchanges, Alice can communicate with Bob under cover of K . If she later decides she needs to talk to another server, Carol, she just re- AB peats message 3 to the TGS, only now specifying C instead of B. The TGS will promptly respond with a ticket encrypted with K that Alice can send to Carol C andthatCarol willacceptasproofthatitcame fromAlice. The pointofallthisworkisthatnowAlice can accessservers all over the net- work in a secure way and her password never has togoover the network. In fact, it only had to be in her own workstation for a few milliseconds. However, note that each server does its own authorization. When Alice presents her ticket to Bob, this merely proves toBob who sent it. Precisely what Alice is allowed todo isuptoBob. Since the Kerberos designers did not expect the entire world to trust a single authentication server, they made provision for having multiple realms, each with its own AS and TGS. To get a ticket for a server in a distant realm, Alice would ask her own TGS for a ticket accepted by the TGS inthe distant realm. Ifthe dis- tant TGS has registered with the local TGS (the same way local servers do), the local TGS will give Alice a ticket valid at the distant TGS. She can then do busi- ness over there, such as getting tickets for servers in that realm. Note, however, that for parties in two realms to do business, each one must trust the other’s TGS. Otherwise, theycannotdobusiness. 8.7.5 Authentication Using Public-Key Cryptography Mutual authentication can also be done using public-key cryptography. To start with, Alice needs to get Bob’s public key. If a PKI exists with a directory server that hands out certificates for public keys, Alice can ask for Bob’s, as shown in Fig.8-43 as message 1. The reply, in message 2, is an X.509 certificate containing Bob’spublickey. When Alice verifies thatthesignature iscorrect, she sendsBobamessage containing heridentityandanonce. When Bob receives this message, he has no idea whether it came from Alice or from Trudy, but he plays along and asks the directory server for Alice’s public key (message 4), which he soon gets (message 5). He then sends Alice message 6,containing Alice’s R ,hisownnonce,R ,andaproposedsession key,K .

Mutualauthenticationusingpublic-keycryptography. When Alice gets message 6, she decrypts it using her private key. She sees R in it, which gives her a warm feeling inside. The message must have come A from Bob, since Trudy has no way of determining R . Furthermore, it must be A fresh and not a replay, since she just sent Bob R . Alice agrees to the session by A sending back message 7', 'When Bob sees R encrypted with the session key he B just generated, he knows Alice got message 6 and verified R . Bob is now a A happycamper. What can Trudy dototry to subvert this protocol? She can fabricate message 3 and trick Bob into probing Alice, but Alice will see an R that she did not send A and will not proceed further. Trudy cannot forge message 7 back to Bob because she does not know R or K and cannot determine them without Alice’s private B S key. Sheisoutofluck. 8.8 EMAIL SECURITY When an email message is sent between two distant sites, it will generally transit dozens ofmachines onthe way. Anyofthese can read andrecord themes- sage for future use. In practice, privacy is nonexistent, despite what many people think. Nevertheless, many people would like to be able to send email that can be read by the intended recipient and no one else: not their boss and not even their government. This desire has stimulated several people and groups to apply the cryptographic principles we studied earlier to email to produce secure email. In the following sections we will study a widely used secure email system, PGP, and then briefly mention one other, S/MIME. For additional information about secure email, see Kaufman etal.(2002)andSchneier (1995). 842 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 8.8.1 PGP—Pretty Good Privacy Our first example, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is essentially the brainchild of one person, Phil Zimmermann (1995a, 1995b). Zimmermann is a privacy advocate whose motto is: ‘‘If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have priva- cy.’’ Released in 1991, PGP is a complete email security package that provides privacy, authentication, digital signatures, and compression, all in an easy-to-use form. Furthermore, the complete package, including all the source code, is dis- tributed free of charge via the Internet. Due to its quality, price (zero), and easy availability on UNIX, Linux, Windows, and Mac OS platforms, it is widely used today. PGP encrypts data by using a block cipher called IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm), which uses 128-bit keys. It was devised in Switzerland atatime whenDESwas seen astainted andAEShadnotyetbeen invented. Con- ceptually, IDEA is similar to DES and AES: it mixes up the bits in a series of rounds, but the details of the mixing functions are different from DES and AES. Key management uses RSA and data integrity uses MD5, topics that we have al- ready discussed. PGP has also been embroiled in controversy since day 1 (Levy, 1993). Be- cause Zimmermann did nothing to stop other people from placing PGP on the In- ternet, where people all over the world could get it, the U.S. Government claimed thatZimmermann hadviolated U.S.laws prohibitingtheexportofmunitions. The U.S. Government’s investigation of Zimmermann went on for 5 years but was eventually dropped, probably for two reasons. First, Zimmermann did not place PGP on the Internet himself, so his lawyer claimed that he never exported any- thing (and then there is the little matter of whether creating a Web site constitutes export at all)', 'Second, the government eventually came to realize that winning a trial meant convincing a jury that a Web site containing a downloadable privacy program was covered by the arms-trafficking law prohibiting the export of war materiel such as tanks, submarines, military aircraft, and nuclear weapons. Years ofnegative publicityprobably didnothelpmuch,either. As an aside, the export rules are bizarre, to put it mildly. The government considered putting code on a Web site to be an illegal export and harassed Zim- mermann about it for 5 years. On the other hand, when someone published the complete PGP source code, in C, as a book (in a large font with a checksum on each page to make scanning it in easy) and then exported the book, that was fine with the government because books are not classified as munitions. The sword is mightier thanthepen,atleast forUncle Sam. Another problem PGP ran into involved patent infringement. The company holding the RSA patent, RSA Security, Inc., alleged that PGP’s use of the RSA algorithm infringed on its patent, but that problem was settled with releases start- ing at 2.6. Furthermore, PGP uses another patented encryption algorithm, IDEA, whose usecaused someproblems atfirst. SEC. 8.8 EMAILSECURITY 843 Since PGP is open source, various people and groups have modified it and produced a number of versions. Some of these were designed to get around the munitions laws, others were focused on avoiding the use of patented algorithms, and still others wanted to turn it into a closed-source commercial product. Al- thoughthe munitionslaws have nowbeen slightly liberalized (otherwise, products using AES would not have been exportable from the U.S.), and the RSA patent expired inSeptember 2000,the legacy of all these problems is that several incom- patible versions of PGP are in circulation, under various names. The discussion below focuses on classic PGP, which is the oldest and simplest version. Another popular version, Open PGP, is described in RFC 2440. Yet another is the GNU Privacy Guard. PGP intentionally usesexisting cryptographic algorithms rather than inventing new ones. It is largely based on algorithms that have withstood extensive peer review and were not designed or influenced by any government agency trying to weaken them. Forpeople whodistrustgovernment,thisproperty isabigplus. PGP supports text compression, secrecy, and digital signatures and also pro- vides extensive key management facilities, but, oddlyenough, not email facilities. It is like a preprocessor that takes plaintext as input and produces signed cipher- text in base64 as output. This output can then be emailed, of course. Some PGP implementations call auseragent asthefinal steptoactually sendthemessage. To see how PGP works, let us consider the example of Fig.8-44. Here, Alice wants to send a signed plaintext message, P, to Bob in a secure way. Both Alice and Bob have private (D ) and public (E ) RSA keys. Let us assume that each X X oneknowstheother’s publickey;wewillcover PGP keymanagement shortly. Alice starts out by invoking the PGP program on her computer. PGP first hashes her message, P, using MD5, and then encrypts the resulting hash using her private RSA key, D ', \"When Bob eventually gets the message, he can decrypt the A hash with Alice’s public key and verify that the hash is correct. Even if someone else (e.g., Trudy) could acquire the hash at this stage and decrypt it with Alice’s known public key, the strength of MD5 guarantees that it would be computa- tionally infeasible toproduceanother message withthesame MD5hash. The encrypted hash and the original message are now concatenated into a sin- gle message, P1, and compressed using the ZIP program, which uses the Ziv- Lempel algorithm (ZivandLempel, 1977). Call theoutputofthisstepP1.Z. Next, PGP prompts Alice for some random input. Both the content and the typing speed are used to generate a 128-bit IDEA message key, K (called a ses- M sion key in the PGP literature, but this is really a misnomer since there is no ses- sion). K is now used to encrypt P1.Z with IDEA in cipher feedback mode. In M addition, K is encrypted with Bob’s public key, E . These two components are M B then concatenated and converted to base64, as we discussed in the section on MIME in Chap. 7. The resulting message contains only letters, digits, and the symbols +, /, and =, which means it can be put into an RFC 822 body and be ex- pected toarrive unmodified. 844 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 K : One-timemessagekeyforIDEA Bob'spublic M RSAkey,E B : Concatenation Alice'sprivate K M RSA RSAkey,D A ASCIItextto P1 P1.Z Base thenetwork MD5 RSA Zip IDEA P 64 P1compressed Original Concatenationof Concatenationof plaintext Pandthesigned P1.Zencrypted message hashofP withIDEAandK M fromAlice encryptedwithE B Figure8-44. PGPinoperationforsendingamessage. When Bob gets the message, he reverses the base64 encoding and decrypts the IDEA key usinghisprivate RSAkey. Usingthiskey,hedecrypts themessage to get P1.Z. After decompressing it, Bob separates the plaintext from the en- crypted hash and decrypts the hash using Alice’s public key. If the plaintext hash agrees with his own MD5 computation, he knows that P is the correct message andthatitcame fromAlice. It is worth noting that RSA is only used in two places here: to encrypt the 128-bitMD5hash and toencrypt the128-bitIDEA key. AlthoughRSA isslow,it has to encrypt only 256 bits, not a large volume of data. Furthermore, all 256 plaintext bits are exceedingly random, so a considerable amount of work will be required on Trudy’s part just to determine if a guessed key is correct. The heavy- duty encryption is done by IDEA, which is orders of magnitude faster than RSA. Thus,PGP provides security, compression, and adigital signature and does soina muchmore efficient waythanthescheme illustratedinFig.8-19. PGP supports four RSA key lengths. It is up to the user to select the one that ismostappropriate. The lengthsare: 1. Casual (384bits):Canbebrokeneasily today. 2. Commercial (512bits):Breakable bythree-letter organizations. 3. Military(1024bits):Notbreakable byanyoneonearth. 4. Alien (2048bits): Notbreakable byanyoneonother planets, either. SEC. 8.8 EMAILSECURITY 845 Since RSA is only used for two small computations, everyone should use alien- strength keysallthetime. The format of a classic PGP message is shown in Fig.8-45. Numerous other formats are also in use. The message has three parts, containing the IDEA key, the signature, and the message, respectively\", 'The key part contains not only the key, but also a key identifier, since users are permitted to have multiple public keys.

APGPmessage. The signature part contains a header, which will not concern us here. The header is followed by a timestamp, the identifier for the sender’s public key that can be used to decrypt the signature hash, some type information that identifies the algorithms used (to allow MD6 and RSA2 to be used when they are invented), andtheencrypted hashitself. The message part also contains a header, the default name of the file to be used if the receiver writes the file to the disk, a message creation timestamp, and, finally, themessage itself. Key management has received a large amount of attention in PGP as it is the Achilles’ heel of all security systems. Key management works as follows. Each user maintains two data structures locally: a private key ring and a public key ring. The private key ring contains one or more personal private/public key pairs. The reason for supporting multiple pairs per user is to permit users to change their public keys periodically or when one is thought to have been compromised, withoutinvalidating messages currently in preparation or in transit. Each pair has an identifier associated with it so that a message sender can tell the recipient which public key was used to encrypt it. Message identifiers consist of the low-order 64 bits of the public key. Users are themselves responsible for avoiding conflicts in their public-key identifiers. The private keys on disk are en- crypted using a special (arbitrarily long) password to protect them against sneak attacks. The publickey ring contains publickeys ofthe user’s correspondents. These are needed toencrypt the message keysassociated witheachmessage. Each entry 846 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 on the public key ring contains not only the public key, but also its 64-bit identi- fier andanindication ofhowstronglytheusertruststhekey. The problem being tackled here is the following. Suppose that public keys are maintained on bulletin boards. One way for Trudy to read Bob’s secret email istoattack thebulletin boardandreplaceBob’spublickeywithone ofher choice. When Alice later fetches the key allegedly belonging to Bob, Trudy can mount a bucket brigade attack onBob. To prevent such attacks, or at least minimize the consequences of them, Alice needs to know how much to trust the item called ‘‘Bob’s key’’ on her public key ring. IfsheknowsthatBobpersonally handed heraCD-ROM containing the key, she can set the trust value to the highest value. It is this decentralized, user-con- trolled approach to public-key management that sets PGP apart from centralized PKIschemes. Nevertheless, people do sometimes obtain public keys by querying a trusted key server. For this reason, after X.509 was standardized, PGP supported these certificates as well as the traditional PGP public key ring mechanism. All current versions ofPGP have X.509support', '8.8.2 S/MIME IETF’s venture into email security, called S/MIME (Secure/MIME), is de- scribed in RFCs 2632 through 2643. It provides authentication, data integrity, secrecy, and nonrepudiation. It also is quite flexible, supporting a variety of cryptographic algorithms. Not surprisingly, given the name, S/MIME integrates well with MIME, allowing all kinds of messages to be protected. A variety of newMIMEheaders are defined, forexample, forholdingdigital signatures. S/MIME does not have a rigid certificate hierarchy beginning at a single root, which hadbeen oneofthe politicalproblems that doomedan earlier system called PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). Instead, users can have multiple trust anchors. As long as a certificate can be traced back to some trust anchor the user believes in, it is considered valid. S/MIME uses the standard algorithms and protocols we have been examining so far, sowe willnotdiscuss it anyfurther here. For the de- tails, please consult theRFCs. 8.9 WEB SECURITY We have juststudied twoimportant areas where security is needed: communi- cations and email. You can think of these as the soup and appetizer. Now it is time for the main course: Web security. The Web is where most of the Trudies hang out nowadays and do their dirty work. In the following sections, we will lookatsomeoftheproblems andissues relating toWeb security. SEC. 8.9 WEBSECURITY 847 Web security can be roughly divided into three parts. First, how are objects and resources named securely? Second, how can secure, authenticated connec- tions be established? Third, what happens when a Web site sends a client a piece of executable code? After looking at some threats, we will examine all these is- sues. 8.9.1 Threats One reads about Web site security problems in the newspaper almost weekly. The situation is really pretty grim. Let us look at a few examples of what has al- ready happened. First, the home pages of numerous organizations have been at- tacked and replaced by new home pages of the crackers’ choosing. (The popular press calls people who break into computers ‘‘hackers,’’ but many programmers reserve that term for great programmers. We prefer to call these people ‘‘crack- ers.’’) Sites that have been cracked include those belonging to Yahoo!, the U.S. Army, the CIA, NASA, and the New York Times. In most cases, the crackers just putupsomefunnytextandthesiteswere repaired within afew hours. Now let us look at some much more serious cases. Numerous sites have been brought down by denial-of-service attacks, in which the cracker floods the site with traffic, rendering it unable torespond to legitimate queries. Often, the attack is mounted from a large number of machines that the cracker has already broken into (DDoS attacks). These attacks are so common that they do not even make the news any more, butthey can cost the attacked sites thousandsofdollars inlost business. In 1999, a Swedish cracker broke into Microsoft’s Hotmail Web site and created a mirror site that allowed anyone to type in the name of a Hotmail user andthenread alloftheperson’scurrent andarchived email. In another case, a 19-year-old Russian cracker named Maxim broke into an e-commerce Web site and stole 300,000 credit card numbers', 'Then he ap- proached the site owners and told them that if they did not pay him $100,000, he would post all the credit card numbers to the Internet. They did not give in to his blackmail, and he indeed posted the credit card numbers, inflicting great damage onmanyinnocentvictims. In a different vein, a 23-year-old California student emailed a press release to a news agency falsely stating that the Emulex Corporation was going to post a large quarterly loss and that the C.E.O. was resigning immediately. Within hours, the company’s stock dropped by 60%, causing stockholders to lose over $2 bil- lion. The perpetrator made a quarter of a million dollars byselling the stock short just before sending the announcement. While this event was not a Web site break-in, it is clear that putting such an announcement on the home page of any bigcorporation wouldhave asimilar effect. We could (unfortunately) go on like this for many more pages. But it is now time to examine some of the technical issues related to Web security. For more 848 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 information about security problems of all kinds, see Anderson (2008a); Stuttard and Pinto (2007); and Schneier (2004). Searching the Internet will also turn up vastnumbers ofspecific cases. 8.9.2 Secure Naming Let us start with something very basic: Alice wants to visit Bob’s Web site. She types Bob’s URL into her browser and a few seconds later, a Web page ap- pears. But is it Bob’s? Maybe yes and maybe no. Trudy might be up to her old tricks again. For example, she might be intercepting all of Alice’s outgoing pack- ets and examining them. When she captures an HTTP GET request headed to Bob’s Web site, she could go to Bob’s Web site herself to get the page, modify it as she wishes, and return the fake page to Alice. Alice would be none the wiser. Worse yet, Trudy could slash the prices at Bob’s e-store to make his goods look very attractive, thereby tricking Alice into sending her credit card number to ‘‘Bob’’tobuysomemerchandise. One disadvantage of this classic man-in-the-middle attack is that Trudy has to be in a position to intercept Alice’s outgoing traffic and forge her incoming traf- fic. In practice, she has to tap either Alice’s phone line or Bob’s, since tapping the fiber backbone is fairly difficult. While active wiretapping is certainly pos- sible, it is a fair amount of work, and while Trudy is clever, she is also lazy. Besides, there are easier ways totrick Alice. DNSSpoofing One way wouldbeforTrudytocrack the DNS system or maybe just the DNS cache at Alice’s ISP, and replace Bob’s IP address (say, 36.1.2.3) with her (Trudy’s) IP address (say, 42.9.9.9). That leads to the following attack. The way it is supposed to work is illustrated in Fig.8-46(a). Here, Alice (1) asks DNS for Bob’s IP address, (2) gets it, (3) asks Bob for his home page, and (4) gets that, too', \"After Trudy has modified Bob’s DNS record to contain her own IP address instead of Bob’s, we get the situation in Fig.8-46(b). Here, when Alice looks up Bob’s IP address, she gets Trudy’s, so all her traffic intended for Bob goes to Trudy. Trudy can now mount a man-in-the-middle attack without having to go to the trouble of tapping any phone lines. Instead, she has to break into a DNS ser- verandchange onerecord, amucheasier proposition. How might Trudy fool DNS? It turns out to be relatively easy. Briefly sum- marized, Trudy can trick the DNS server at Alice’s ISP into sending out a query to look up Bob’s address. Unfortunately, since DNS uses UDP, the DNS server has no real way of checking who supplied the answer. Trudy can exploit this property by forging the expected reply and thus injecting a false IP address into the DNS server’s cache. For simplicity, we will assume that Alice’s ISP does not initially have an entry for Bob’s Web site, bob.com. If it does, Trudy can wait untilittimes outandtrylater (oruseothertricks).

(a) Normal situation.(b)Anattack basedonbreaking intoaDNS serverandmodifyingBob’srecord. Trudy starts the attack by sending a lookup request to Alice’s ISP asking for the IP address of bob.com. Since there is no entry for this DNS name, the cache server queries the top-level server for the com domain to get one. However, Trudy beats the com server to the punch and sends back a false reply saying: ‘‘bob.com is 42.9.9.9,’’ where that IP address is hers. If her false reply gets back to Alice’s ISP first, that one will be cached and the real reply will be rejected as an unsolicited reply to a query no longer outstanding. Tricking a DNS server into installing a false IP address is called DNS spoofing. A cache that holds an inten- tionally false IPaddress likethisiscalled apoisoned cache. Actually, thingsare notquite that simple. First, Alice’s ISP checks tosee that the reply bears the correct IP source address of the top-level server. But since Trudy can put anything she wants in that IP field, she can defeat that test easily since theIPaddresses ofthetop-level servers have tobepublic. Second, to allow DNS servers to tell which reply goes with which request, all requests carry a sequence number. To spoof Alice’s ISP, Trudy has to know its current sequence number. The easiest way to learn the current sequence number is for Trudy to register a domain herself, say, trudy-the-intruder.com. Let us as- sume its IP address is also 42.9.9.9. She also creates a DNS server for her newly hatched domain, dns.trudy-the-intruder.com. It, too, uses Trudy’s 42.9.9.9 IP ad- dress, since Trudy has only one computer. Now she has to make Alice’s ISP aware of her DNS server. That is easy to do\", \"All she has to dois ask Alice’s ISP for foobar.trudy-the-intruder.com, which will cause Alice’s ISP to find out who serves Trudy’snewdomainbyaskingthetop-level comserver. 850 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 Withdns.trudy-the-intruder.com safely inthecacheat Alice’s ISP, the real at- tack can start. Trudy now queries Alice’s ISP for www.trudy-the-intruder.com. The ISP naturally sends Trudy’s DNS server a query asking for it. This query bears the sequence number that Trudy is looking for. Quick like a bunny, Trudy asks Alice’s ISP to look up Bob. She immediately answers her own question by sending the ISP a forged reply, allegedly from the top-level com server, saying: ‘‘bob.com is 42.9.9.9’’. This forged reply carries a sequence number one higher than the one she just received. While she is at it, she can also send a second for- gery with a sequence number two higher, and maybe a dozen more with increas- ing sequence numbers. One of them is bound to match. The rest will just be thrown out. When Alice’s forged reply arrives, it is cached; when the real reply comes inlater, itisrejected since noqueryisthenoutstanding. Now when Alice looks up bob.com, she is told to use 42.9.9.9, Trudy’s ad- dress. Trudy has mounted a successful man-in-the-middle attack from the com- fort of her own living room. The various steps to this attack are illustrated in Fig.8-47. This one specific attack can be foiled by having DNS servers use ran- domIDsintheir queries rather than justcounting,butitseems that every time one hole is plugged, another one turns up. In particular, the IDs are only 16 bits, so working through all of them is easy when it is a computer that is doing the guess- ing.

HowTrudyspoofsAlice’sISP. Secure DNS The real problem is that DNS was designed at a time when the Internet was a research facility for a few hundred universities, and neither Alice, nor Bob, nor Trudy was invited to the party. Security was not an issue then; making the Inter- net work at all was the issue. The environment has changed radically over the SEC. 8.9 WEBSECURITY 851 years, so in 1994 IETF set up a working group to make DNS fundamentally se- cure. This (ongoing) project is known as DNSsec (DNS security); its first output was presented in RFC 2535. Unfortunately, DNSsec has not been fully deployed yet,sonumerousDNSservers are stillvulnerable tospoofingattacks. DNSsec is conceptually extremely simple. It is based on public-key crypto- graphy. Every DNS zone (in the sense of Fig.7-5) has a public/private key pair. All information sent bya DNS server is signed with the originating zone’s private key,sothereceivercan verify itsauthenticity. DNSsec offers three fundamentalservices: 1. Proofofwhere thedata originated. 2. Public keydistribution. 3. Transaction andrequest authentication. The main service is the first one, which verifies that the data being returned has been approved by the zone’s owner. The second one is useful for storing and retrieving publickeys securely. The third oneisneeded toguard against playback and spoofing attacks\", 'Note that secrecy is not an offered service since all the information inDNS isconsidered public. Since phasing in DNSsec is expected to take several years, the ability for security-aware servers to interwork with securi- ty-ignorantservers isessential, whichimplies thattheprotocol cannotbechanged. Let usnowlookatsome ofthedetails. DNS records are grouped into sets called RRSets (Resource Record Sets), with all the records having the same name, class, and type being lumped together in a set. An RRSet may contain multiple A records, for example, if a DNS name resolves to a primary IP address and a secondary IP address. The RRSets are ex- tended with several new record types (discussed below). Each RRSet is crypto- graphically hashed (e.g., using SHA-1). The hash is signed by the zone’s private key (e.g., using RSA). The unit of transmission to clients is the signed RRSet. Upon receipt of a signed RRSet, the client can verify whether itwas signed bythe private key of the originating zone. If the signature agrees, the data are accepted. Since each RRSet contains its own signature, RRSets can be cached anywhere, even atuntrustworthy servers, withoutendangering thesecurity. DNSsec introduces several new record types. The first of these is the KEY record. This records holds the public key of a zone, user, host, or other principal, the cryptographic algorithm used for signing, the protocol used for transmission, and a few other bits. The public key is stored naked. X.509 certificates are not used due to their bulk. The algorithm field holds a 1 for MD5/RSA signatures (the preferred choice), and other values for other combinations. The protocol field can indicate theuseofIPsec orothersecurity protocols, ifany. The second new record type is the SIG record. It holds the signed hash according to the algorithm specified in the KEY record. The signature applies to all the records in the RRSet, including any KEY records present, but excluding 852 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 itself. It also holds the times when the signature begins its period of validity and whenitexpires, aswell asthesigner’s name andafew other items. The DNSsec design is such that a zone’s private key can be kept offline. Once or twice a day, the contents of a zone’s database can be manually tran- sported (e.g., onCD-ROM) toadisconnectedmachine onwhich the private key is located. All the RRSets can be signed there and the SIG records thus produced can be conveyed back to the zone’s primary server on CD-ROM. In this way, the private key can be stored on a CD-ROM locked in a safe except when it is insert- edintothedisconnectedmachine forsigningtheday’snewRRSets. After signing is completed, all copies of the key are erased from memory and the disk and the CD-ROM are returned to the safe. This procedure reduces electronic security to physicalsecurity, something people understandhowtodeal with. This method of presigning RRSets greatly speeds up the process of answering queries since no cryptography has to be done on the fly. The trade-off is that a large amount of disk space is needed to store all the keys and signatures in the DNSdatabases. Somerecords willincrease tenfold insize duetothesignature', 'When a client process gets a signed RRSet, it must apply the originating zone’s public key to decrypt the hash, compute the hash itself, and compare the two values. If they agree, the data are considered valid. However, this procedure begs the question of how the client gets the zone’s public key. One way is to ac- quire itfromatrusted server, usingasecure connection(e.g., usingIPsec). However, in practice, it is expected that clients will be preconfigured with the public keys of all the top-level domains. If Alice now wants to visit Bob’s Web site, shecan askDNSforthe RRSet ofbob.com,which willcontain hisIPaddress and a KEY record containing Bob’s public key. This RRSet will be signed by the top-level com domain, so Alice can easily verify its validity. An example of what thisRRSet mightcontain isshowninFig.8-48. Domainname Timetolive Class Type Value bob.com. 86400 IN A 36.1.2.3 bob.com. 86400 IN KEY 3682793A7B73F731029CE2737D... bob.com. 86400 IN SIG 86947503A8B848F5272E53930C... Figure8-48. Anexample RRSetfor bob.com. The KEY record isBob’s public key. TheSIGrecord isthetop-levelcomserver’s signedhashoftheAandKEY recordstoverifytheirauthenticity. Now armed with a verified copy of Bob’s public key, Alice can ask Bob’s DNS server (run by Bob) for the IP address of www.bob.com. This RRSet will be signed by Bob’s private key, so Alice can verify the signature on the RRSet Bob returns. If Trudy somehow manages to inject a false RRSet into any of the caches,Alice can easily detect itslack ofauthenticity because the SIGrecord con- tained initwillbeincorrect. SEC. 8.9 WEBSECURITY 853 However, DNSsec also provides a cryptographic mechanism to bind a re- sponse to a specific query, to prevent the kind of spoof Trudy managed to pull off in Fig.8-47. This (optional) antispoofing measure adds to the response a hash of the query message signed with the respondent’s private key. Since Trudy does not know the private key of the top-level com server, she cannot forge a response to a query Alice’s ISP sent there. She can certainly get her response back first, butitwillberejected duetoitsinvalid signature overthehashed query. DNSsec also supports a few other record types. For example, the CERT record can be used for storing (e.g., X.509)certificates. Thisrecord has been pro- vided because some people want to turn DNS into a PKI. Whether this will ac- tually happen remains to be seen. We will stop our discussion of DNSsec here. Formore details, please consult RFC 2535. 8.9.3 SSL—The Secure Sockets Layer Secure naming is a good start, but there is much more to Web security. The next step is secure connections. We will now look at how secure connections can beachieved. Nothinginvolvingsecurity issimple andthisisnoteither. When the Web burstintopublicview, it was initially used for just distributing static pages. However, before long, some companies got the idea of using it for financial transactions, such as purchasing merchandise by credit card, online banking, and electronic stock trading. These applications created a demand for secure connections. In1995,Netscape Communications Corp., the then-dominant browser vendor, responded by introducing a security package called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to meet this demand', 'This software and its protocol are now widely used, for example, by Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer, so it is worth examining insomedetail. SSL buildsasecure connectionbetween twosockets, including 1. Parameter negotiation between client andserver. 2. Authentication oftheserver bytheclient. 3. Secret communication. 4. Data integrity protection. We have seen these items before, sothere isnoneed toelaborate onthem. The positioning of SSL in the usual protocol stack is illustrated in Fig.8-49. Effectively, it is a new layer interposed between the application layer and the transport layer, accepting requests from the browser and sending them down to TCP for transmission to the server. Once the secure connection has been estab- lished, SSL’s main job is handling compression and encryption. When HTTP is used overSSL, itiscalled HTTPS (Secure HTTP),even thoughitisthestandard HTTP protocol. Sometimes it is available at a new port (443) instead of port 80. 854 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 As an aside, SSL is not restricted to Web browsers, but that is its most common application. Itcanalso providemutual authentication. Application(HTTP) Security(SSL) Transport(TCP) Network(IP) Datalink(PPP) Physical(modem,ADSL,cableTV) Figure8-49. Layers(andprotocols)forahomeuserbrowsingwithSSL. The SSL protocol has gone through several versions. Below we will discuss only version 3, which is the most widely used version. SSL supports a variety of different options. These options include the presence or absence of compression, the cryptographic algorithms to be used, and some matters relating to export res- trictions on cryptography. The last is mainly intended to make sure that serious cryptography is used only when both ends of the connection are in the United States. In other cases, keys are limited to 40 bits, which cryptographers regard as something of a joke. Netscape was forced to put in this restriction in order to get anexportlicense fromtheU.S. Government. SSL consists of two subprotocols, one for establishing a secure connection and one for using it. Let us start out by seeing how secure connections are estab- lished. The connection establishment subprotocol is shown in Fig. 8-50. It starts out with message 1 when Alice sends a request to Bob to establish a connection. The request specifies the SSL version Alice has and her preferences with respect to compression and cryptographic algorithms. It also contains a nonce, R , to be A usedlater. Now it is Bob’s turn. In message 2, Bob makes a choice among the various algorithms that Alice can supportand sends hisownnonce,R . Then, inmessage B 3, he sends a certificate containing his public key. If this certificate is not signed by some well-known authority, he also sends a chain of certificates that can be followed back to one. All browsers, including Alice’s, come preloaded with about 100 public keys, so if Bob can establish a chain anchored to one of these, Alice will be able to verify Bob’s public key. At this point, Bob may send some other messages (such as a request for Alice’s public-key certificate). When Bob isdone,hesendsmessage 4totell Alice itisherturn. Alice responds by choosing a random 384-bit premaster key and sending it to Bob encrypted with his public key (message 5)', 'The actual session key used for encrypting data is derived from the premaster key combined with both nonces in a complex way. After message 5 has been received, both Alice and Bob are able to compute the session key. For this reason, Alice tells Bob to switch to the SEC. 8.9 WEBSECURITY 855 SSLversion,preferences,R A SSLversion,choices,R B X.509certificatechain Serverdone E (premasterkey) B Changecipher 7 Finished 8 Changecipher 9 Finished ecilA boB 1 2 3 4 5 6 Figure8-50. AsimplifiedversionoftheSSLconnectionestablishmentsubprotocol. new cipher (message 6) and also that she is finished with the establishment subprotocol(message 7). Bobthenacknowledgesher(messages 8and9). However, althoughAlice knowswhoBob is, Bob does not know who Alice is (unless Alice has a public key and a corresponding certificate for it, an unlikely situation for an individual). Therefore, Bob’s first message may well be a request for Alice to log in using a previously established login name and password. The login protocol, however, is outside the scope of SSL. Once it has been accom- plished, bywhatever means, data transport canbegin. As mentioned above, SSL supports multiple cryptographic algorithms. The strongest one uses triple DES with three separate keys for encryption and SHA-1 formessage integrity. This combination isrelatively slow, so it is mostly used for banking and other applications in which the highest security is required. For or- dinary e-commerce applications, RC4 is used with a 128-bit key for encryption and MD5 is used for message authentication. RC4 takes the 128-bit key as a seed and expands it to a much larger number for internal use. Then it uses this internal number to generate a keystream. The keystream is XORed with the plaintext to provide a classical stream cipher, as we saw in Fig.8-14. The export versions also use RC4 with 128-bit keys, but 88 of the bits are made public to make the cipher easy tobreak. For actual transport, a second subprotocol is used, as shown in Fig.8-51. Messages from the browser are first broken into units of up to 16 KB. If data 856 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 compression is enabled, each unit is then separately compressed. After that, a secret key derived from the two nonces and premaster key is concatenated with the compressed text and the result is hashed with the agreed-on hashing algorithm (usually MD5). This hash is appended to each fragment as the MAC. The compressed fragment plus MAC is then encrypted with the agreed-on symmetric encryption algorithm (usually by XORing it with the RC4 keystream). Finally, a fragment header is attached and the fragment is transmitted over the TCP con- nection. Messagefrombrowser Fragmentation Part1 Part2 Compression Message authentication code MACadded Encryption Headeradded Figure8-51. DatatransmissionusingSSL. Awordofcaution isinorder, however. Since it has been shown that RC4 has some weak keys that can be easily cryptanalyzed, the security of SSL using RC4 is on shaky ground (Fluhrer et al., 2001). Browsers that allow the user to choose the cipher suite should be configured to use triple DES with 168-bit keys and SHA-1 all the time, even though this combination is slower than RC4 and MD5', 'Or, better yet, users should upgrade to browsers that support the successor to SSL thatwedescribe shortly. A problem with SSL is that the principals may not have certificates, and even iftheydo,theydonotalways verify thatthekeysbeingusedmatch them. In 1996, Netscape Communications Corp. turned SSL over to IETF for stan- dardization. The result was TLS (Transport Layer Security). It is described in RFC 5246. TLS was built on SSL version 3. The changes made to SSL were relatively small, but just enough that SSL version 3 and TLS cannot interoperate. For ex- ample, the way the session key is derived from the premaster key and nonces was SEC. 8.9 WEBSECURITY 857 changed to make the key stronger (i.e., harder to cryptanalyze). Because of this incompatibility, most browsers implement both protocols, with TLS falling back to SSL during negotiation if necessary. This is referred to as SSL/TLS. The first TLS implementation appeared in 1999 with version 1.2 defined in August 2008. It includes support for stronger cipher suites (notably AES). SSL has remained stronginthemarketplacealthoughTLS willprobably gradually replaceit. 8.9.4 Mobile Code Security Naming and connections are two areas of concern related to Web security. But there are more. In the early days, when Web pages were just static HTML files, they did not contain executable code. Now they often contain small pro- grams, including Java applets, ActiveX controls, and JavaScripts. Downloading and executing such mobile code is obviously a massive security risk, so various methods have been devised to minimize it. We will now take a quick peek at someoftheissuesraised bymobilecode andsomeapproaches todealing withit. JavaApplet Security Java applets are small Java programs compiled to a stack-oriented machine language called JVM (Java Virtual Machine). They can be placed on a Web page for downloading along with the page. After the page is loaded, the applets are inserted intoaJVMinterpreter inside thebrowser, asillustratedinFig. 8-52. Virtualaddressspace 0xFFFFFFFF Untrustedapplet Sandbox Interpreter Trustedapplet Webbrowser 0 Figure8-52. AppletscanbeinterpretedbyaWebbrowser. The advantage of running interpreted code over compiled code is that every instruction is examined by the interpreter before being executed. This gives the interpreter the opportunity to check whether the instruction’s address is valid. In addition, system calls are also caught and interpreted. How these calls are hand- led is a matter of the security policy. For example, if an applet is trusted (e.g., it 858 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 came from the local disk), its system calls could be carried out without question. However, if an applet is not trusted (e.g., it came in over the Internet), it could be encapsulated in what is called a sandbox to restrict its behavior and trap its at- tempts tousesystem resources. When an applet tries to use a system resource, its call is passed to a security monitor for approval. The monitor examines the call in light of the local security policy andthen makes adecision toallow orreject it. Inthis way, it is possible to give applets accesstosome resources butnotall. Unfortunately, the realityisthat thesecurity modelworksbadlyandthatbugsinitcropupallthetime. ActiveX ActiveX controls are x86 binary programs that can be embedded in Web pages', 'When one of them is encountered, a check is made to see if it should be executed, andit ifpasses the test, it isexecuted. Itisnotinterpreted or sandboxed inanyway, soithas as much power as anyother userprogram andcan potentially dogreat harm. Thus, all the security isinthe decision whether torunthe ActiveX control. Inretrospect, thewhole idea isagigantic security hole. The methodthat Microsoft chose formaking thisdecision isbased onthe idea of code signing. Each ActiveX control is accompanied by a digital signature—a hash of the code that is signed by its creator using public-key cryptography. When an ActiveX control shows up, the browser first verifies the signature to make sure it has not been tampered with in transit. If the signature is correct, the browser then checks its internal tables to see if the program’s creator is trusted or there is a chain of trust back to a trusted creator. If the creator is trusted, the pro- gram is executed; otherwise, it is not. The Microsoft system for verifying Ac- tiveX controls iscalled Authenticode. It is useful to contrast the Java and ActiveX approaches. With the Java ap- proach, noattempt ismade todetermine whowrote theapplet. Instead, arun-time interpreter makes sure it does not do things the machine owner has said applets may not do. In contrast, with code signing, there is no attempt to monitor the mobile code’s run-time behavior. If it came from a trusted source and has not been modified in transit, it just runs. No attempt is made to see whether the code is malicious or not. If the original programmer intended the code to format the hard disk and then erase the flash ROM so the computer can never again be booted, and if the programmer has been certified as trusted, the code will be run and destroy the computer (unless ActiveX controls have been disabled in the browser). Many people feel that trusting an unknown software company is scary. To demonstrate the problem, a programmer in Seattle formed a software company and got it certified as trustworthy, which is easy to do. He then wrote an ActiveX control that did a clean shutdown of the machine and distributed his ActiveX con- trol widely. It shut down many machines, but they could just be rebooted, so no SEC. 8.9 WEBSECURITY 859 harm was done. He was just trying to expose the problem to the world. The of- ficial response was to revoke the certificate for this specific ActiveX control, which ended a short episode of acute embarrassment, but the underlying problem is still there for an evil programmer to exploit (Garfinkel with Spafford, 2002). Since there is no way to police the thousands of software companies that might write mobile code, thetechnique ofcode signingisadisaster waitingtohappen. JavaScript JavaScript does not have any formal security model, but it does have a long history of leaky implementations. Each vendor handles security in a different way. For example, Netscape Navigator version 2used something akin to the Java model, butbyversion4thathadbeen abandonedforacode-signing model. The fundamental problem is that letting foreign code run on your machine is asking for trouble', 'From a security standpoint, it is like inviting a burglar into your house and then trying to watch him carefully so he cannot escape from the kitchen into the living room. If something unexpected happens and you are dis- tracted foramoment, badthingscan happen. The tension here isthatmobile code allows flashy graphics and fast interaction, and many Web site designers think that this is much more important than security, especially when it is somebody else’s machine atrisk. Browser Extensions Aswell as extending Web pages with code, there isabooming marketplace in browser extensions, add-ons, and plug-ins. They are computer programs that extend the functionality of Web browsers. Plug-ins often provide the capability to interpret or display a certain type of content, such as PDFs or Flash animations. Extensions and add-ons provide new browser features, such as better password management, or ways to interact with pages by, for example, marking them up or enabling easy shoppingforrelated items. Installing an extension, add-on, or plug-in is as simple as coming across something you want when browsing and following the link to install the program. Thisaction willcause code tobe downloaded across the Internet andinstalled into the browser. All of these programs are written to frameworks that differ depend- ingonthe browser that isbeing enhanced. However, toafirst approximation, they become part of the trusted computing base of the browser. That is, if the code that isinstalled isbuggy,theentire browser canbecompromised. There are two other obvious failure modes as well. The first is that the pro- gram may behave maliciously, for example, by gathering personal information and sending it toa remote server. For all the browser knows, the user installed the extension for precisely this purpose. The second problem is that plug-ins give the browser the ability to interpret new types of content. Often this content is a full 860 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 blown programming language itself. PDF and Flash are good examples. When users viewpages withPDF andFlash content, theplug-insintheir browser are ex- ecuting the PDF and Flash code. That code had better be safe; often there are vul- nerabilities that it can exploit. For all of these reasons, add-ons and plug-ins shouldonlybeinstalled asneeded andonlyfromtrusted vendors. Viruses Viruses are another form of mobile code. Only, unlike the examples above, viruses are not invited in at all. The difference between a virus and ordinary mobile code is that viruses are written to reproduce themselves. When a virus ar- rives, either via a Web page, an email attachment, or some other way, it usually starts out by infecting executable programs on the disk. When one of these pro- grams is run, control is transferred to the virus, which usually tries tospread itself to other machines, for example, by emailing copies of itself to everyone in the victim’s email address book. Some viruses infect the bootsector of the hard disk, sowhenthe machine isbooted,the virusgets torun. Viruses have become ahuge problem on the Internet and have caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage. There is no obvious solution', 'Perhaps a whole new generation of operating sys- tems based on secure microkernels and tight compartmentalization of users, proc- esses, andresources mighthelp. 8.10 SOCIAL ISSUES The Internet and its security technology is an area where social issues, public policy, and technology meet head on, often with huge consequences. Below we will just briefly examine three areas: privacy, freedom of speech, and copyright. Needless to say, we can only scratch the surface. For additional reading, see Anderson (2008a), Garfinkel with Spafford (2002), and Schneier (2004). The In- ternet is also full of material. Just type words such as ‘‘privacy,’’ ‘‘censorship,’’ and ‘‘copyright’’ into any search engine. Also, see this book’s Web site for some links. Itisathttp://www.pearsonhighered.com/tanenbaum. 8.10.1 Privacy Do people have a right to privacy? Good question. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from searching people’s houses, papers, and effects without good reason, and goes on to restrict the circumstances underwhich search warrants shall beissued. Thus,privacy hasbeen onthepublic agenda forover200years, atleast intheU.S. What has changed inthe past decade is both the ease with which governments can spy on their citizens and the ease with which the citizens can prevent such SEC. 8.10 SOCIALISSUES 861 spying. Inthe 18thcentury, forthe governmenttosearch acitizen’spapers, ithad to send out a policeman on a horse to go to the citizen’s farm demanding to see certain documents. It was a cumbersome procedure. Nowadays, telephone com- panies and Internet providers readily provide wiretaps when presented withsearch warrants. It makes life much easier for the policeman and there is no danger of fallingoffahorse. Cryptography changes all that. Anybody who goes to the trouble of down- loading and installing PGP and who uses awell-guarded alien-strength key can be fairly sure that nobody in the known universe can read his email, search warrant or no search warrant. Governments well understand this and do not like it. Real privacy means itismuchharder forthemtospyoncriminals ofallstripes, butitis also much harder to spy on journalists and political opponents. Consequently, some governments restrict or forbid the use or export of cryptography. In France, for example, prior to 1999, all cryptography was banned unless the government was giventhekeys. France was not alone. In April 1993, the U.S. Government announced its intention to make a hardware cryptoprocessor, the clipper chip, the standard for all networked communication. It was said that this would guarantee citizens’ pri- vacy. It also mentioned that the chip provided the government with the ability to decrypt all traffic via a scheme called key escrow,which allowed the government access to all the keys. However, the government promised only to snoop when it had a valid search warrant. Needless to say, a huge furor ensued, with privacy advocates denouncing the whole plan and law enforcement officials praising it. Eventually, thegovernmentbacked downanddroppedtheidea. A large amount of information about electronic privacy is available at the Electronic Frontier Foundation’sWeb site, www.eff.org. Anonymous Remailers PGP, SSL, and other technologiesmake it possible for two parties to establish secure, authenticated communication, free from third-party surveillance and inter- ference. However, sometimes privacy isbest served bynothaving authentication, in fact, by making communication anonymous', 'The anonymity may be desired forpoint-to-point messages, newsgroups,orboth. Let usconsider some examples. First, political dissidents living under author- itarian regimes often wish to communicate anonymously to escape being jailed or killed. Second, wrongdoing in many corporate, educational, governmental, and other organizations has often been exposed by whistleblowers, who frequently prefer to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. Third, people with unpopular social, political, or religious views may wish to communicate with each other via email or newsgroups without exposing themselves. Fourth, people may wish to discuss alcoholism, mental illness, sexual harassment, child abuse, or being a 862 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 member of a persecuted minority in a newsgroup without having to go public. Numerous other examples exist, ofcourse. Let us consider a specific example. In the 1990s, some critics of a nontradi- tional religious group posted their views to a USENET newsgroup via an anonymous remailer. This server allowed users to create pseudonyms and send email to the server, which then remailed or re-posted them using the pseudonyms, so noone could tell where the messages really came from. Some postings reveal- ed what the religious group claimed were trade secrets and copyrighted docu- ments. The religious group responded by telling local authorities that its trade secrets had been disclosed and its copyright infringed, both of which were crimes where the server was located. A court case followed and the server operator was compelled toturnover the mapping information that revealed the true identitiesof the persons who had made the postings. (Incidentally, this was not the first time that a religious group was unhappy when someone leaked its trade secrets: Wil- liam Tyndale was burned at the stake in 1536 for translating the Bible into Eng- lish). A substantial segment of the Internet community was completely outraged by this breach of confidentiality. The conclusion that everyone drew is that an anonymousremailer thatstores a mapping between real email addresses andpseu- donyms (now called a type 1 remailer) is not worth much. This case stimulated various people into designing anonymousremailers that could withstand subpoena attacks. These new remailers, often called cypherpunk remailers, work as follows. The user produces an email message, complete with RFC 822 headers (except From:, of course), encrypts it with the remailer’s public key, and sends it to the remailer. There the outer RFC 822 headers are stripped off, the content is de- crypted and the message is remailed. The remailer has noaccounts and maintains no logs, so even if the server is later confiscated, it retains no trace of messages thathave passed throughit. Many users who wish anonymity chain their requests through multiple anonymous remailers, as shown in Fig. 8-53. Here, Alice wants to send Bob a really, really, really anonymousValentine’s Day card, so she uses three remailers. She composes the message, M, and puts a header onit containing Bob’s email ad- dress. Then she encrypts the whole thing with remailer 3’s public key, E (indi- 3 cated by horizontal hatching). To this she prepends a header with remailer 3’s email address in plaintext', 'This is the message shown between remailers 2 and 3 inthefigure. Then she encrypts this message with remailer 2’spublickey, E (indicated by 2 vertical hatching) and prepends a plaintext header containing remailer 2’s email address. This message is shown between 1 and 2 in Fig. 8-53. Finally, she en- crypts the entire message with remailer 1’s public key, E , and prepends a plain- 1 text header with remailer 1’s email address. This is the message shown to the rightofAlice inthefigure andthisisthemessage sheactually transmits.

HowAliceusesthreeremailerstosendBobamessage. When the message hits remailer 1, the outer header is stripped off. The body is decrypted and then emailed to remailer 2. Similar steps occur at the other two remailers. Althoughitisextremely difficult foranyonetotracethe final message back to Alice, many remailers take additional safety precautions. For example, they may holdmessages forarandomtime, addorremove junkattheendofamessage, and reorder messages, all tomake itharder foranyonetotell whichmessage outputby a remailer corresponds to which input, in order to thwart traffic analysis. For a description ofthiskindofremailer, see Mazie`resandKaashoek (1998). Anonymity is not restricted to email. Services also exist that allow anonymous Web surfing using the same form of layered path in which one node only knows the next node in the chain. This method is called onion routing be- cause each node peels off another layer of the onion to determine where to for- ward the packet next. The user configures his browser to use the anonymizer ser- vice as a proxy. Tor is a well-known example of such a system (Dingledine et al., 2004). Henceforth, all HTTP requests go through the anonymizer network, which requests the page and sends it back. The Web site sees an exit node of the anonymizer network as the source of the request, not the user. As long as the anonymizer network refrains from keeping a log, after the fact no one can deter- minewhorequested which page. 8.10.2 Freedom of Speech Privacy relates to individuals wanting to restrict what other people can see about them. A second key social issue is freedom of speech, and its opposite, censorship, which is about governments wanting to restrict what individuals can read and publish. With the Web containing millions and millions of pages, it has become acensor’s paradise. Depending onthe nature and ideology of the regime, banned material mayinclude Websites containing anyofthefollowing: 864 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 1. Material inappropriate forchildren orteenagers. 2. Hate aimed atvariousethnic, religious, sexual orothergroups. 3. Information aboutdemocracy anddemocratic values. 4. Accountsofhistorical events contradicting thegovernment’sversion. 5. Manuals forpickinglocks, buildingweapons,encrypting messages, etc. The usualresponseistobanthe‘‘bad’’sites. Sometimes the results are unexpected. For example, some public libraries have installed Web filters on their computers to make them child friendly by blocking pornography sites. The filters veto sites on their blacklists but also check pages for dirty words before displaying them', 'In one case in Loudoun County, Virginia, the filter blocked a patron’s search for information on breast cancer because the filter saw the word ‘‘breast.’’ The library patron sued Loudoun County. However, in Livermore, California, a parent sued the public library for not installing a filter after her 12-year-old son was caught viewing pornography there. What’s alibrary todo? Ithas escaped many people that the World Wide Web is a worldwide Web. It covers the whole world. Not all countriesagree onwhat shouldbe allowed onthe Web. For example, in November 2000,a French court ordered Yahoo!, a Califor- nia Corporation, to block French users from viewing auctions of Nazi memorabi- lia on Yahoo!’s Web site because owning such material violates French law. Yahoo! appealed to a U.S. court, which sided with it, but the issue of whose laws applywhere isfarfromsettled. Just imagine. What would happen if some court in Utah instructed France to block Web sites dealing with wine because they do not comply with Utah’s much stricter laws about alcohol? Suppose that China demanded that all Web sites dealing with democracy be banned as not in the interest of the State. Do Iranian laws on religion apply to more liberal Sweden? Can Saudi Arabia block Web sites dealing withwomen’s rights? Thewhole issueisaveritable Pandora’sbox. A relevant comment from John Gilmore is: ‘‘The net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.’’ For a concrete implementation, consider the eter- nity service (Anderson, 1996). Its goal is to make sure published information cannot be depublished or rewritten, as was common in the Soviet Union during Josef Stalin’s reign. To use the eternity service, the user specifies how long the material is to be preserved, pays a fee proportional to its duration and size, and uploadsit. Thereafter, noonecan remove oreditit,noteventheuploader. How could such a service be implemented? The simplest model is to use a peer-to-peer system in which stored documents wouldbe placedondozens ofpar- ticipating servers, eachofwhich gets a fraction ofthe fee, andthusanincentive to join the system. The servers should be spread over many legal jurisdictions for maximum resilience. Lists of 10 randomly selected servers would be stored SEC. 8.10 SOCIALISSUES 865 securely in multiple places, so that if some were compromised, others would still exist. An authority bent on destroying the document could never be sure it had foundall copies. The system could also be made self-repairing inthe sense that if it became known that some copies had been destroyed, the remaining sites would attempt tofindnewrepositories toreplacethem. The eternity service was the first proposal for a censorship-resistant system. Since then, others have been proposed and, in some cases, implemented. Various new features have been added, such as encryption, anonymity,and fault tolerance. Often the files to be stored are broken up into multiple fragments, with each frag- ment stored on many servers. Some of these systems are Freenet (Clarke et al., 2002), PASIS (Wylie et al., 2000), and Publius (Waldman et al., 2000). Other workisreported bySerjantov (2002)', 'Increasingly, many countries are trying to regulate the export of intangibles, which often include Web sites, software, scientific papers, email, telephone help- desks, and more. Even the U.K., which has a centuries-long tradition of freedom of speech, is now seriously considering highly restrictive laws, that would, for ex- ample, define technical discussions between a British professor and his foreign Ph.D. student, both located at the University of Cambridge, as regulated export needing a government license (Anderson, 2002). Needless to say, many people consider suchapolicytobeoutrageous. Steganography In countries where censorship abounds, dissidents often try to use technology to evade it. Cryptography allows secret messages to be sent (although possibly not lawfully), but if the government thinks that Alice is a Bad Person, the mere fact that she is communicating with Bob may get him put in this category, too, as repressive governments understand the concept of transitive closure, even if they are short on mathematicians. Anonymous remailers can help, but if they are banned domestically and messages to foreign ones require a government export license, theycannothelpmuch. ButtheWeb can. People who want to communicate secretly often try to hide the fact that any communication at all is taking place. The science of hiding messages is called steganography, from the Greek words for ‘‘covered writing.’’ In fact, the ancient Greeks used it themselves. Herodotus wrote of a general who shaved the head of a messenger, tattooed a message on his scalp, and let the hair grow back before sending him off. Modern techniques are conceptually the same, only they have a higher bandwidth, lower latency, anddonotrequire theservices ofabarber. As a case in point, consider Fig. 8-54(a). This photograph, taken by one of the authors (AST) in Kenya, contains three zebras contemplating an acacia tree. Fig.8-54(b) appears to be the same three zebras and acacia tree, but it has an extra added attraction. It contains the complete, unabridged text of five of 866 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 Shakespeare’s plays embedded in it: Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, The Merchant ofVenice,andJulius Caesar. Together, these playstotal over700KBoftext. (a) (b) Figure8-54. (a)Three zebras andatree. (b)Three zebras, atree, andthecom- pletetextoffiveplaysbyWilliamShakespeare. How does this steganographic channel work? The original color image is 1024×768 pixels. Each pixel consists of three 8-bit numbers, one each for the red, green, and blue intensity of that pixel. The pixel’s color is formed by the linear superposition of the three colors. The steganographic encoding method uses the low-order bit of each RGB color value as a covert channel. Thus, each pixel has room for 3 bits of secret information, 1 in the red value, 1 in the green value, and 1 in the blue value. With an image of this size, up to 1024×768×3 bitsor294,912bytes ofsecret information canbestored init. The fulltextofthefive plays and ashortnotice addupto734,891bytes. This text was first compressed to about 274 KB using a standard compression algo- rithm. The compressed output was then encrypted using IDEA and inserted into the low-order bits of each color value. As can be seen (or actually, cannot be seen), the existence ofthe information iscompletely invisible', 'Itisequally invisi- ble in the large, full-color version of the photo. The eye cannot easily distinguish 21-bitcolor from24-bitcolor. Viewing the two images in black and white with low resolution does not do justice to how powerful the technique is. To get a better feel for how steganogra- phy works, we have prepared a demonstration, including the full-color high- resolution image of Fig.8-54(b) with the five plays embedded in it. The demons- tration, including tools for inserting and extracting text into images, can be found atthebook’sWebsite. To use steganography for undetected communication, dissidents could create a Web site bursting with politically correct pictures, such as photographs of the Great Leader, local sports,movie, andtelevision stars, etc. Ofcourse, the pictures would be riddled with steganographic messages. If the messages were first SEC. 8.10 SOCIALISSUES 867 compressed and then encrypted, even someone who suspected their presence would have immense difficulty in distinguishing the messages from white noise. Of course, the images should be fresh scans; copying a picture from the Internet andchanging someofthebitsisadeadgiveaway. Images are by no means the only carrier for steganographic messages. Audio files also work fine. Hidden information can be carried in a voice-over-IP call by manipulating the packet delays, distorting the audio, or even in the header fields of packets (Lubacz et al., 2010). Even the layout and ordering of tags in an HTML file can carry information. Although we have examined steganography in the context of free speech, it has numerous other uses. One common use is for the owners of images toencode secret messages in them stating their ownership rights. If such an image is stolen and placed on a Web site, the lawful owner can reveal the steganographic mes- sage incourt to prove whose image it is. This technique is called watermarking. Itisdiscussed inPiva etal.(2002). Formore onsteganography,see Wayner (2008). 8.10.3 Copyright Privacy andcensorship are justtwoareas where technologymeets publicpoli- cy. A third one is the copyright law. Copyright is granting to the creators of IP (Intellectual Property), including writers, poets, artists, composers, musicians, photographers, cinematographers, choreographers, and others, the exclusive right to exploit their IP for some period of time, typically the life of the author plus 50 years or 75 years in the case of corporate ownership. After the copyright of a workexpires, itpasses intothepublicdomain and anyonecan use orsell itas they wish. The Gutenberg Project (www.promo.net/pg), for example, has placed thou- sands of public-domain works (e.g., by Shakespeare, Twain, and Dickens) on the Web. In 1998, the U.S. Congress extended copyright in the U.S. by another 20 years at the request of Hollywood, which claimed that without an extension nobodywould create anything any more. By way of contrast, patents last foronly 20years andpeople stillinventthings. Copyrightcame to the forefront when Napster, a music-swapping service, had 50 million members. Although Napster did not actually copy any music, the courts held that its holding a central database of who had which song was contri- butory infringement, that is, it was helping other people infringe', 'While nobody seriously claims copyright is a bad idea (although many claim that the term is far too long, favoring big corporations over the public), the next generation of music sharingisalready raising major ethical issues. For example, consider a peer-to-peer network in which people share legal files (public-domainmusic, homevideos, religious tracts thatare nottrade secrets, etc.) and perhaps a few that are copyrighted. Assume that everyone is online all the time via ADSL or cable. Each machine has an index of what is on the hard 868 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 disk, plusa list ofother members. Someone lookingfora specific item can pick a random member and see if he has it. If not, he can check out all the members in that person’s list, and all the members in their lists, and so on. Computers are verygoodatthiskindofwork. Havingfoundtheitem, therequester justcopies it. If the work is copyrighted, chances are the requester is infringing (although for international transfers, the question of whose law applies matters because in some countries uploading is illegal but downloading is not). But what about the supplier? Isitacrime tokeepmusic youhave paidforandlegally downloaded on your hard disk where others might find it? If you have an unlocked cabin in the countryandanIPthief sneaks incarrying anotebookcomputer andscanner, scans a copyrighted book to the notebook’s hard disk, and sneaks out, are you guilty of thecrime offailingtoprotect someone else’s copyright? Butthere ismore trouble brewing onthe copyrightfront. There is a huge bat- tle going on now between Hollywood and the computer industry. The former wants stringent protection of all intellectual property but the latter does not want to be Hollywood’s policeman. In October 1998, Congress passed the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act), which makes it a crime to circumvent any protection mechanism present in a copyrighted work or to tell others how to cir- cumvent it. Similar legislation has been enacted in the European Union. While virtually no one thinks that pirates in the Far East should be allowed to duplicate copyrighted works, many people think that the DMCA completely shifts the bal- ance between thecopyrightowner’s interest andthepublicinterest. Acase inpoint:inSeptember 2000,amusic industryconsortium charged with building an unbreakable system for selling music online sponsoreda contest invit- ing people to try to break the system (which is precisely the right thing to do with any new security system). A team of security researchers from several universi- ties, led by Prof. Edward Felten of Princeton, took up the challenge and broke the system. They then wrote a paper about their findings and submitted it to a USENIX security conference, where it underwent peer review and was accepted. Before the paper was to be presented, Felten received a letter from the Recording Industry Association of America that threatened to sue the authors under the DMCAiftheypublishedthepaper. Their response was to file a lawsuit asking a federal court to rule on whether publishing scientific papers on security research was still legal. Fearing a defini- tivecourt rulingagainst it,theindustrywithdrew its threat and the court dismissed Felten’s suit', 'No doubt the industry was motivated by the weakness of its case: it had invited people to try to break its system and then threatened to sue some of them for accepting its own challenge. With the threat withdrawn, the paper was published(Craver etal., 2001). Anewconfrontation isvirtually certain. Meanwhile, pirated music and movies have fueled the massive growth of peer-to-peer networks. This has notpleased the copyright holders, who have used the DMCA to take action. There are now automated systems that search peer-to- peer networks and then fire off warnings to network operators and users who are SEC. 8.10 SOCIALISSUES 869 suspected of infringing copyright. In the United States, these warnings are known as DMCA takedown notices. This search is an arms’ race because it is hard to reliably catch copyright infringers. Even your printer might be mistaken for a culprit (Piatek etal., 2008). A related issue is the extent of the fair use doctrine, which has been estab- lished by court rulings in various countries. This doctrine says that purchasers of a copyrighted work have certain limited rights to copy the work, including the right to quote parts of it for scientific purposes, use it as teaching material in schools or colleges, and in some cases make backup copies for personal use in case the original medium fails. The tests for what constitutes fair use include (1) whether the use is commercial, (2) what percentage of the whole is being copied, and (3) the effect ofthe copyingonsales ofthe work. Since the DMCA andsimi- lar laws within the European Union prohibit circumvention of copy protection schemes, these laws also prohibit legal fair use. In effect, the DMCA takes away historical rights from users to give content sellers more power. A major show- downisinevitable. Another development in the works that dwarfs even the DMCA in its shifting of the balance between copyright owners and users is trusted computing as advocatedbyindustrybodiessuch as the TCG (Trusted Computing Group), led by companies like Intel and Microsoft. The idea is toprovide support for careful- lymonitoring userbehavior invariousways (e.g., playingpirated music) atalevel below the operating system in order to prohibit unwanted behavior. This is accomplished with a small chip, called a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), which it is difficult to tamper with. MostPCs soldnowadays come equipped with aTPM. The system allows software writtenby content owners tomanipulate PCs in ways that users cannot change. This raises the question of who is trusted in trusted computing. Certainly, it is not the user. Needless to say, the social conse- quences of this scheme are immense. It is nice that the industry is finally paying attention to security, but it is lamentable that the driver is enforcing copyright law rather than dealing with viruses, crackers, intruders, and other security issues that mostpeople are concerned about. In short, the lawmakers and lawyers will be busy balancing the economic in- terests ofcopyrightowners with the publicinterest foryears tocome', 'Cyberspace is no different from meatspace: it constantly pits one group against another, re- sulting in power struggles, litigation, and (hopefully) eventually some kind of resolution, atleast untilsomenewdisruptive technologycomes along. 8.11 SUMMARY Cryptography is a tool that can be used to keep information confidential and to ensure its integrity and authenticity. All modern cryptographic systems are based onKerckhoff’s principle of having a publicly known algorithm and a secret 870 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP. 8 key. Many cryptographic algorithms use complex transformations involving sub- stitutions and permutations to transform the plaintext into the ciphertext. Howev- er, if quantum cryptography can be made practical, the use of one-time pads may provide trulyunbreakablecryptosystems. Cryptographic algorithms can be divided into symmetric-key algorithms and public-key algorithms. Symmetric-key algorithms mangle the bits in a series of rounds parameterized by the key to turn the plaintext into the ciphertext. AES (Rijndael) and triple DES are the most popular symmetric-key algorithms at pres- ent. These algorithms can be used in electronic code book mode, cipher block chaining mode,stream cipher mode,countermode,andothers. Public-key algorithms have the property that different keys are used for en- cryption and decryption and that the decryption key cannot be derived from the encryption key. These properties make it possible to publish the public key. The main public-key algorithm is RSA, which derives its strength from the fact that it isverydifficult tofactor large numbers. Legal, commercial, andother documents need tobesigned. Accordingly, var- ious schemes have been devised for digital signatures, using both symmetric-key and public-key algorithms. Commonly, messages to be signed are hashed using algorithms such as SHA-1, and then the hashes are signed rather than the original messages. Public-key management can be done using certificates, which are documents that bind a principal to a public key. Certificates are signed by a trusted authority or by someone (recursively) approved by a trusted authority. The root of the chain has tobe obtained inadvance, butbrowsers generally havemanyrootcertif- icates builtintothem. These cryptographic tools can be used to secure network traffic. IPsec oper- ates in the network layer, encrypting packet flows from host to host. Firewalls can screen traffic goinginto or outof an organization, often based on the protocol and port used. Virtual private networks can simulate an old leased-line network to provide certain desirable security properties. Finally, wireless networks need good security lest everyone read all the messages, and protocols like 802.11i pro- videit. When two parties establish a session, they have to authenticate each other and, if need be, establish a shared session key. Various authentication protocols exist, including some that use a trusted third party, Diffie-Hellman, Kerberos, and public-keycryptography. Email security can be achieved by a combination of the techniques we have studied in this chapter. PGP, for example, compresses messages, then encrypts them witha secret keyandsends the secret key encrypted with the receiver’spub- lic key. Inaddition,it also hashes themessage andsendsthesignedhashtoverify message integrity. Web security isalso animportant topic, starting with secure naming. DNSsec provides a way to prevent DNS spoofing. Most e-commerce Web sites use SEC. 8.11 SUMMARY 871 SSL/TLS toestablish secure, authenticated sessions between the client and server', 'Various techniques are used to deal with mobile code, especially sandboxing and code signing. The Internet raises many issues in which technology interacts strongly with public policy. Some of the areas include privacy, freedom of speech, and copy- right. PROBLEMS 1.

Many interesting topics have not been treated in as much detail as they deserve, and others have been omitted altogether for lack of space. In this chap- ter, we provide some suggestions for further reading and a bibliography, for the benefit ofreaders whowishtocontinue their studyofcomputer networks. 9.1 SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING There is an extensive literature on all aspects of computer networks. Two journals that publish papers in this area are IEEE/ACM Transactions on Network- ingandIEEEJournalonSelected Areas inCommunications. The periodicals oftheACMSpecial Interest GroupsonData Communications (SIGCOMM) and Mobility of Systems, Users, Data, and Computing (SIGMO- BILE) publish many papers of interest, especially on emerging topics. They are Computer Communication Review and Mobile Computing and Communications Review. IEEE also publishes three magazines—IEEE Internet Computing, IEEE Net- work Magazine, and IEEE Communications Magazine—that contain surveys, tutorials, and case studies on networking. The first two emphasize architecture, standards, and software, and the last tends toward communications technology (fiber optics, satellites,andsoon). 877 878 READING LISTANDBIBLIOGRAPHY CHAP. 9 There are a number of annual or biannual conferences that attract numerous papers on networks', 'In particular, look for the SIGCOMM conference, NSDI (Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation), MobiSys (Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services), SOSP (Symposium on Operating Systems Principles) and OSDI (Symposium on Operating Systems Design andImplementation). Below welistsomesuggestionsforsupplementaryreading, keyed tothe chap- ters of this book. Many of the suggestions are books of chapters in books, with sometutorials andsurveys.

Comer describes the history, growth, technology, protocols, and services of the Internet in terms that novices can understand, but so much material is covered thatthebookisalso ofinterest tomoretechnical readers. Computer Communication Review,25thAnniversary Issue, Jan. 1995 For a firsthand look at how the Internet developed, this special issue collects important papers up to 1995. Included are papers that show the development of TCP, multicast,the DNS, Ethernet, andtheoverall architecture. Crovella andKrishnamurthy, Internet Measurement How do we know how well the Internet works anyway? This question is not trivial to answer because no one is in charge of the Internet. This book describes the techniques that have been developed to measure the operation of the Internet, fromnetwork infrastructure toapplications. IEEEInternet Computing,Jan.–Feb. 2000 The first issue of IEEE Internet Computing in the new millennium did exactly what you would expect: it asked the people who helped create the Internet in the previous millennium to speculate on where it is going in the next one. The experts are Paul Baran, Lawrence Roberts, Leonard Kleinrock, Stephen Crocker, Danny Cohen, Bob Metcalfe, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, and others. See how well their predictions havefared overadecadelater. Kipnis, ‘‘Beating theSystem: Abuses oftheStandards AdoptionProcess’’ Standards committees try to be fair and vendor neutral in their work, but un- fortunately there are companies that try to abuse the system.

Many people have claimed credit. And rightly so, since many people had a hand in it, in different ways. There was Paul Baran, who wrote a report describing packet switching, there were the people at various universities who designed the ARPANET architecture, there were the people at BBN who programmed the first IMPs, there were Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf who invented TCP/IP, and so on.

Most of the first half deals with IP and related protocols in the net- work layer. The other chapters deal primarily with the higher layers and are also worthreading. Grayson etal., IPDesign forMobile Networks Traditionaltelephonenetworks and the Internet are ona collision course, with mobile phone networks being implemented with IP on the inside. This book tells how to design a network using the IP protocols that supports mobile telephone service. Huitema, RoutingintheInternet,2nded', 'If you want to gain a deep understanding of routing protocols, this is a very good book. Both pronounceable algorithms (e.g., RIP, and CIDR) and unpro- nounceable algorithms (e.g., OSPF, IGRP, and BGP) are treated in great detail. Newer developments are not covered since this is an older book, but what is covered isexplained verywell. KoodliandPerkins, Mobile Inter-networking withIPv6 Two important network layer developments are presented in one volume: IPv6 and Mobile IP. Both topics are covered well, and Perkins was one of the drivingforces behindMobileIP. Nucci and Papagiannaki, Design, Measurement and Management of Large-Scale IPNetworks We talked a great deal about how networks work, but not how you would de- sign, deploy and manage one ifyouwere anISP. This bookfillsthat gap, looking at modern methods for traffic engineering and how ISPs provide services using networks. Perlman, Interconnections,2nded. In Chaps. 12 through 15, Perlman describes many of the issues involved in unicast and multicast routing algorithm design, both for wide area networks and networks of LANs. But byfar, the best part of the book is Chap. 18, in which the author distills her many years of experience with network protocols into an infor- mative andfunchapter. Itisrequired reading forprotocol designers. Stevens, TCP/IP Illustrated,Vol.1 Chapters 3–10 provide a comprehensive treatment of IP and related protocols (ARP, RARP, andICMP), illustratedbyexamples. 882 READING LISTANDBIBLIOGRAPHY CHAP. 9 Varghese, Network Algorithmics We have spent much time talking about how routers and other network ele- ments interact with each other. This book is different: it is about how routers are actually designed toforward packets at prodigious speeds. For the inside scoop on that and related questions, this is the book to read. The author is an authority on clever algorithms that are used in practice to implement high-speed network ele- ments insoftware andhardware. 9.1.6 The Transport Layer Comer, Internetworking withTCP/IP,Vol.1,5thed. As mentioned above, Comer has written the definitive work on the TCP/IP protocol suite. ThesecondhalfofthebookisaboutUDPandTCP. Farrell andCahill,Delay- andDisruption-Tolerant Networking This short book is the one to read for a deeper look at the architecture, proto- cols, and applications of ‘‘challenged networks’’ that must operate under harsh conditions of connectivity. The authors have participated in the development of DTNsintheIETF DTN Research Group. Stevens, TCP/IP Illustrated,Vol.1 Chapters 17–24 provide a comprehensive treatment of TCP illustrated by ex- amples. 9.1.7 The Application Layer Berners-Lee etal., ‘‘The WorldWide Web’’ Take a tripback intime foraperspective onthe Web and where it is goingby the person who invented it and some of his colleagues at CERN.

SEC. 9.1 SUGGESTIONSFORFURTHERREADING 883 Krishnamurthy andRexford, WebProtocols andPractice It would be hard to find a more comprehensive book about all aspects of the Web than this one. It covers clients, servers, proxies, and caching, as you might expect. But there are also chapters on Web traffic and measurements as well as chapters oncurrent research andimprovingtheWeb. Simpson, Video Over IP,2nded. The author takes a broad look at how IP technology can be used to move video across networks, both on the Internet and in private networks designed to carry video. Interestingly, this book is oriented for the video professional learning aboutnetworking, rather thantheother wayaround. Wittenburg,UnderstandingVoice Over IPTechnology This book covers how voice over IP works, from carrying audio data with the IP protocols and quality-of-service issues, through to the SIP and H.323 suite of protocols. It is necessarily detailed given the material, but accessible and broken upintodigestible units. 9.1.8 Network Security Anderson, Security Engineering,2nd.ed. This book presents a wonderful mix of security techniques couched in an un- derstanding of how people use (and misuse) them. It is more technical than Secrets and Lies, but less technical than Network Security (see below). After an introduction to the basic security techniques, entire chapters are devoted to vari- ous applications, including banking, nuclear command and control, security print- ing, biometrics, physical security, electronic warfare, telecom security, e-com- merce, andcopyrightprotection. Ferguson etal., CryptographyEngineering Many books tell you how the popular cryptographic algorithms work. This book tells you how to use cryptography—why cryptographic protocols are de- signed the way they are and how toput them together into a system that will meet your security goals. It is a fairly compact book that is essential reading for any- onedesigning systems thatdepend oncryptography. Fridrich, SteganographyinDigital Media Steganography goes back to ancient Greece, where the wax was melted off blank tablets so secret messages could be applied to the underlying wood before the wax was reapplied. Nowadays, videos, audio, and other content on the Inter- net provide different carriers for secret messages. Various modern techniques for hidingandfindinginformation inimages are discussed here. 884 READING LISTANDBIBLIOGRAPHY CHAP. 9 Kaufman etal., Network Security,2nded. This authoritative and witty book is the first place to look for more technical information on network security algorithms and protocols. Secret and public key algorithms and protocols, message hashes, authentication, Kerberos, PKI, IPsec, SSL/TLS, and email security are all explained carefully and at considerable length, with many examples. Chapter 26, on security folklore, is a real gem. In security, the devil is in the details. Anyone planning to design a security system that will actually be used will learn a lot from the real-world advice in this chap- ter. Schneier, Secrets andLies If you read Cryptography Engineering from cover to cover, you will know everything there is to know about cryptographic algorithms', 'If you then read Secrets and Lies cover to cover (which can be done in a lot less time), you will learn that cryptographic algorithms are not the whole story. Most security weaknesses are not due to faulty algorithms or even keys that are too short, but to flaws in the security environment. For a nontechnical and fascinating discussion ofcomputer security inthebroadest sense, thisbookisaverygoodread. SkoudisandListon, CounterHack Reloaded,2nded. The best way to stop a hacker is to think like a hacker. This book shows how hackers see a network, and argues that security should be a function of the entire network’s design, not an afterthought based on one specific technology. It covers almost all common attacks, including the ‘‘social engineering’’ types that take ad- vantage ofusers whoare notalways familiarwithcomputer security measures. 9.2 ALPHABETICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY ABRAMSON,N.:‘‘InternetAccessUsingVSATs,’’IEEECommun.Magazine,vol.38,pp. 60–68,July2000.
